There’s no one-size-fits-all strategy to develop each of these markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the surveyed, 37.3% encounter the greatest difficulty in dealing with language and cultural barriers; 20.8% say they find it the most challenging to adapt their business models to meet different market needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Localization is equally important in mature markets&nbsp;like Japan.

Know-how and success stories were shared as aspiring entrepreneurs in Taiwan joined other participants worldwide to build a global entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p>With the support of 61 government agencies and institutions—including 22 startup incubators, 13 central government agencies, seven local government departments, 10 college and university partners, and nine institutions—a total of 55 entrepreneurship-related events took place across the island from November 18 to 24. The Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted SBIR Program Information Events, the SME Leadership and Business Succession Summit, SME Innovation and Digital Transformation, the Entrepreneurship Academy, the APEC Financial Opportunities Fair for Women-led MSMEs, and a lecture and counseling session in Kinmen County.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10436\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"5760\" height=\"3840\" srcset=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-2.jpg 5760w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-2-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-2-980x653.jpg 980w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-2-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, ((min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px)) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 5760px, 100vw\" /></p>\r\n<p>GEW is an international initiative launched by the Kauffman Foundation in 2008. It connects participants with entrepreneurial opportunities and encourages them to work together and brainstorm innovative ideas that provide solutions to existing problems. A total of 250,000 people have taken part in over 300 entrepreneurship-related events and activities hosted by the government and the private sector in Taiwan since we joined the initiative in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Kicking off the series of events on November 18 was a lecture entitled “Lessons from Failure: Things to Learn from Failed Startups.” The speaker shared the eight essential characteristics of a successful entrepreneur and discussed tests that can help people identify the type of entrepreneurs they are, so as to lower the failure rate. On November 19 and 20, representatives from ASEAN countries participated in the SME Leadership and Business Succession Summit. Well-known speakers from different fields were invited by the organizer and the American Institute in Taiwan to share with SMEs in Taiwan ways to embrace transformation and AI-based digitization and take advantage of available opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>This year’s GEW focused on encouraging and accelerating female entrepreneurship, as this could have the same positive effect that the entry of women into the labor force had during the previous century. On November 20, a micro-entrepreneurship workshop was held for women, older people and residents from offshore islands who plan to create micro enterprises. Attendees learned about free entrepreneurship-related courses and counseling sessions as well as subsidies available to assist them in embarking on a successful entrepreneurship journey. This year, the SMEA also joined forces with Russia to organize the APEC Financial Opportunities Fair for Women-led MSMEs. By accessing capacity building platforms, female entrepreneurs can acquire financial resources, strategies and experience, and expand their networks to connect with international opportunities.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10437\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" srcset=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-3.jpg 2048w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-3-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-3-980x653.jpg 980w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081212-3-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, ((min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px)) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2048px, 100vw\" /></p>\r\n<p>Useful workshops and lectures were held to train aspiring entrepreneurs. On November 21, the SMEA’s Entrepreneurship Academy held a lecture on entrepreneurship knowledge and skills to help startup teams or enterprises grow at a faster pace. The aim was to encourage people who have managerial responsibilities but lack business and management backgrounds to gain management knowledge and skills and thereby enhance company efficiency and productivity.</p>\r\n<p>Those living in rural communities also had ample opportunities to realize their dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. On November 22, the Executive Yuan’s Startup Hub collaborated with the Kinmen County government, Kinmen Startup Hub, Taiwan Business Bank and Commerce Development Research Institute to host a lecture and counseling session in Kinmen to help local startups access available government resources.</p>\r\n<p>The 2019 Maker Festival, held at the National Taiwan Science Education Center on November 23, featured a competition, an award ceremony, lectures, workshops, and other interesting activities, enabling visitors to experience the joy of being a maker. The 15 projects selected were displayed at a special exhibition.</p>\r\n<p>On November 24, the GEW concluded with the IoT Innovative Application Annual Summit. This year’s summit, held in the form of a panel discussion, focused on information and communication security in the wake of the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). The event introduced the basic concepts of web-based authentication, various types of benchmark applications, and ways to establish comprehensive information security mechanisms, allowing participants to acquire a better understanding of the importance of information security in the era of IoT.</p>\r\n<p>Many other lectures, workshops and events were held during the GEW, with participants giving positive feedback.

(4, 'The warlord in the park: How x-Googler Andy Cheng used constant problem-solving to deliver better products to the market and grow his startup', '2019-12-10', 'news', '<p>First attempts at startup products usually fall short. This can be really frustrating, but early-stage founders don’t often realise that these false starts are real opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Why? When founders give this product to new users, they are trying to help a new customer fare better than those “normal” people who do things in what founders consider the “old way.”</p>\r\n<p>Most people using a new feature or a product for the first time are used to doing business, or experiencing something in what they consider the normal way. They are not like the founder, who has dreamed up a vision of how things should be done. When a founder gives this new product to a potential customer, she is trying to do three things:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sell the product!</li>\r\n<li>Integrate this new vision into the customer’s reality.</li>\r\n<li>Solve a problem that often a potential customer didn’t even know they had.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This new approach takes time to understand and appreciate. It’s almost like taking someone and plopping them down in a new culture, or in a different era somewhere far into the future. By giving these potential customers something very new, they will approach it with some skepticism, some doubt, and some reasons why it won’t work.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, it’s inevitable that a first trial will end in incremental data and not much customer acquisition.</p>\r\n<p>But this new confrontation with tech is a chance to seek feedback. This feedback creates a cycle of improvement. This is why founders who struggle with their own problem first usually have a better chance of finding product-market fit.</p>\r\n<p>I will tell you a story about a founder who went through <a title=\"https://appworks.tw/accelerator\" href=\"https://appworks.tw/accelerator\">the AppWorks Accelerator</a> and launched his own product successfully to demonstrate this point.</p>\r\n<h2>The Park</h2>\r\n<p>It was a spring day in Taipei around the year 2011 and then-Googler Andy Cheng was looking for a house to buy. Married and with a young son, Andy wanted a property his family could grow into. A real estate agent showed him a house in a desirable neighborhood. A stretch of park just behind the house meant this was exactly what he was looking for.</p>\r\n<p>Andy nearly made an offer. Then he found out that the park was slated for school construction. Rushing to close, the broker hid this from Andy. The seed of an idea was planted in Andy’s mind.</p>\r\n<p>“I thought, ‘Man, what else have you not told me,’” says Andy, as he looked back at how he developed <a title=\"https://www.foundi.info/\" href=\"https://www.foundi.info/\">foundi</a> (AppWorks #8), a real estate listing platform.</p>\r\n<p>The first thought Andy had had when he set to work was not: How could he solve the problem of a culture of manipulation and secrecy that seemed endemic to real estate brokers?</p>\r\n<p>He only sees that his startup could make an impact in that area in retrospect. Like many founders, Andy’s MVP alone didn’t help the real end user &#8212; at the time, house buyers &#8212; but it started a process that eventually got him there. And this is really important for early founders to understand.</p>\r\n<p>A new product alone is never enough to create scale and customer growth. You have to do a whole lot of digging to get there.</p>\r\n<h2>How It Started</h2>\r\n<p>From Andy’s perspective, there were so many houses to choose from, so wouldn’t trust and honesty be the winning factor for an agent closing a contract?</p>\r\n<p>Andy learned that relatively low-paid real estate agents live off of commission, and in doing so, they often worked in ferocious competition against each other, even in the same agencies. In contract bidding &#8212; even before negotiations &#8212; the potential future sale of a home often goes to the agent that creates the most perfect too good to be true contract. House sellers want a good return, so agents will find ways to make their pitch of the future contract as lucrative as possible.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn’t matter if the price is true, or if it accurately reflects the true conditions of the house. It’s every man for himself.</p>\r\n<p>It gets worse!</p>\r\n<p>Since every agent is motivated by commission, agents who are first to find the listing will also try to hide the listing info from other agents, making it nearly impossible for other agents to pitch a contract.</p>\r\n<p>This unethical weirdness became more than an engineering puzzle for Andy, who was quite proficient with software programming and maps. Previously, he had worked as one of Google’s first hires in Taiwan, managing a team of engineers in the maps division. Code and problem-solving are in his wheelhouse. “I always go to the computer to code, to figure things out,” he says. But to tackle this problem, he had to go beyond the screen.</p>\r\n<p>He created an early version of foundi. House sellers and buyers would use that version to find information about listings. But they took this info back to agents and used it to try to haggle better deals. This put burdens on the buyers of houses, though; this was exactly the position Andy was in before and didn’t want.</p>\r\n<p>He booked meetings with influential agencies and set up face-to-face consultations. He discovered that real estate agents were typically not the best performers in school. They are also technology-averse. It explained a lot.</p>\r\n<p>With the right technology, they wouldn’t have had to be dishonest to compete. By sitting down and walking through foundi features with early adopter agents, Andy finally got to a point where he was able to convince more of them to use the product.</p>\r\n<p>Like an arms dealer selling his weapons to different cartels, Andy started to spread his tool to different agencies. Whereas previously agents in the same agencies would be pitted against each other, teams began to perform at a higher level. Other agencies saw agencies doing better, and wanted the same tool.</p>\r\n<p>“I felt like I was a warlord,” Andy jokes.</p>\r\n<p>Has he made the market more transparent? It’s hard to say this early in the game. But according to Andy, this counterintuitive outcome holds promise.</p>\r\n<p>By taking away the old things that made agents competitive &#8212; their secrecy and manipulation &#8212; he has actually made real estate agents more competitive. Therein lies a fundamental concept of startup building, and the core reason why data drives product development. Early-stage founders might take note of this technique.</p>\r\n<p>Now, Andy’s customers number about 12,000 agents of the total 40,000 in Taiwan, who rely on foundi to serve their customers better and in turn maximize their income. Andy takes a long-term approach to this door-to-door sales effort.</p>\r\n<p><strong>“ For [what will be] a hundred-year-old tree, I will say we are now at the stage of ‘small tree,’ but strong and healthily growing up,” says Andy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Creating new tech to solve real problems is really the experience of giving people new mental models to live a better life. If a founder has a good head on his shoulders, and is passionate about what he’s doing, he will eventually build something that people need, in a market people didn’t know could exist. No newly launched product can do this immediately. It’s always a process, and it involves founders stepping away from the computer and even leaving the building, to get it right.</p>\r\n<p>Answers, and your product, exist in people’s heads and hearts, whether they know it or not. As a founder, you are quite simply the enabler that will help them experience that by delivering a tangible good that unlocks a mental model. Think of it as a game, with a constant state of going on side quests. Without those quests, you cannot complete the journey.</p>\r\n<p><em>The author of this article: Doug Crets, Communications Specialist, AppWorks Accelerator.</em></p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45827\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45827</a></p>', './img/1081210-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Reminiscent of the story of Sisyphus, the action has its significance if considered an attempt to fight back, he says.</p>\r\n<div class=\"al-section al-photo \">\r\n	<figure><img class=\"image fr-fic fr-dii\" title=\"The Last Thieves\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1573619956-71355@900.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1573619956-71355@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1573619956-71355@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1573619956-71355@900.jpg 900w\" style=\"width: 800px;\" alt=\"\">\r\n		<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Jack Hsu, Founder of Self Token / Photograph : Business Next</figcaption>\r\n	</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To Mr. Hsu, issuing the new token Self is one of his ways to fight back as well. To promote immersive entertainment, he hopes to invite everyone to engage in an inclusive and transparent economic system based on blockchain technology. But first, he believes, the token should be used in daily lives for people to feel its benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Ethereum-based token, his audience is able to make transactions in the movie scenes recreated in real life. For example, one can pay with Self for a cocktail that a movie character drinks in the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through blockchain, the interaction between films and fans can last long after the screening and be a part of people’s lives, Mr. Hsu says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self Token also works with ezding, one of the biggest movie ticket booking platforms in Taiwan, as well as bookstores and restaurants, to expand the use and circulation of its token. Of course, one can buy themselves a drink with Self in Mr. Hsu’s bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users are able to complete transactions in three seconds, a lot faster than on bitcoin, and receive reward points for supporting the decentralized community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self can be used in Selfer Card, a decentralized card game based on&nbsp;<em>The Last Thieves</em>. Players will be randomly assigned to the team of either sages or thieves to accumulate points in the virtual world through making transactions, interacting with other players, and so on, in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Through Selfer Card, we can turn the world into a huge playground,” Self Token&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/self-token-cn/%E8%81%96%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%9C-%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2-selfer-card-%E5%85%A8%E9%9D%A2%E9%87%8B%E5%87%BA-8de59862276\" title=\"https://medium.com/self-token-cn/%E8%81%96%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%9C-%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2-selfer-card-%E5%85%A8%E9%9D%A2%E9%87%8B%E5%87%BA-8de59862276\">says</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Hsu insists the use of Self should always be relevant to building immersive entertainment experiences for the public.

Learn from Back Founder and Green Funding', '2019-12-04', 'news', '<p>Of late, the presence of Taiwanese products on Japanese crowdfunding platforms is becoming more and more common and so is the other way around. Back Founder, for example, has been working closely with Japan’s major crowdfunding site Green Funding to introduce Taiwan’s high-quality products to Japanese customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.backer-founder.com/\" title=\"https://www.backer-founder.com/\">Back Founder</a> is a Taiwan-based consultancy firm that provides professional guidance for crowdfunding campaign launchers.

Yusuke Takahashi, Director at Green Funding, says he has been in Taiwan for more than 10 times — to participate in exhibitions and activities for crowdfunding projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the opportunities for campaign launchers? Mr. Lin tells us that the Taiwanese tend to gravitate towards lifestyle products, whereas this type of products is overall unpopular in Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Takahashi further delineates whom the backers of crowdfunding campaigns in Japan are: men at the age of 30 to 50, who like techie and functional products and prefer colors of low chroma like black, white, and grey. In Taiwan, on the other hand, backers are fond of designer products that are creative and cute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another main difference lies in gender distribution: in Taiwan, the difference between the numbers of male and female backers is not as significant as in Japan, where 75 out of 100 are men. Most Japanese crowdfunding sites are now grappling with strategies to attract more female backers and encourage product diversity on their platform, says Mr. Takahashi.</p>\r\n<div class=\"al-section al-photo \">\r\n	<figure><img class=\"image fr-fic fr-dii\" title=\"Green Funding\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1574125243-72845-745120191203144337@900.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1574125243-72845-745120191203144337@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1574125243-72845-745120191203144337@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-11/img-1574125243-72845-745120191203144337@900.jpg 900w\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n		<figcaption>Team members of Green Funding / Photogrph : Business Next</figcaption>\r\n	</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>He believes his team should introduce more baby and pet products to the site, for example. However, an increase in the number of such products hasn’t yet been observed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, this type of products seems to be particularly tricky. Mr. Lin says customers buy them only when they’re sure it’s safe to use them on their children and fur kids, whom they can pamper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the difficulty to promote these products, they can still be quite a success in Taiwan because brands and producers are able to find a trustworthy third party to endorse them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, a peculiarity of Japanese people explains why the performance of Japan’s crowdfunding market lags behind that in Taiwan: they are cautious, Mr. Takahashi says, and they trust homegrown companies more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can Taiwanese crowdfunding sites can learn from their Japanese counterparts? On Japanese platforms, one may stumble across many interesting projects, including animations and other types of artwork that are considered intellectual property, says Mr. Lin, and these are elements that can perhaps be added to Taiwanese platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company Back Founder has been dedicated to bringing Taiwan’s products to the global stage and next year, it seeks to launch more of those on Japanese and Korean crowdfunding sites. Mr. Lin adds that working with local partners like Green Funding will be especially helpful if these products get to enter local retail marketplace after the crowdfunding experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it seems inevitable that they start on US crowdfunding sites, including Indiegogo and Kickstarter, before entering the Japanese market, says Mr. Takahashi. This helps to earn trust from Japanese backers, who are drawn to American culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Lin says crowdfunding projects from Taiwan should be funded at least half to one-third the amount they raise at home in Japan, if those from Japan can raise $2M in Taiwan while they receive merely $1M at home; yet it’s not the case in reality. He believes a better communication strategy is the key to break into the market, and Back Founder will learn more about it by continuing its exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45794\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45794</a></p>', './img/1081204-2-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2020-01-30 07:39:33', NULL);

(8, 'Newly released data shows GSEA founders have a huge growth opportunity going forward', '2019-12-04', 'news', '<p>The latest Map of Greater Southeast Asia’s digital economies, released by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://appworks.tw/\" title=\"https://appworks.tw/\">AppWorks</a>, a leading accelerator and venture capital firm in the region, is indicating to founders that the rise of mobile broadband in economies where GDP growth is accelerating past 6 per cent is setting the stage for amazing improvisation in tech use and commercial problem-solving. It may come as a surprise to some, but Taiwan can play a pivotal role in that innovation surge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the supporter of the largest accelerator-born community in the region focused on tech founders, our team watches closely these developments. Our portfolio companies and the 1113 founders and 376 active startups of our Accelerator alumni network are living examples of the magnet that Taiwan has become for founders in this region.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Starting small, in a huge region called GSEA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We refer to this region as Greater Southeast Asia (GSEA), positioning it as ASEAN + Taiwan, inclusive of such territories as Hong Kong and Macau, and East Timor. The nomenclature is driven by our observation of consumption habits and statistical data, as you can see in the map below, which hangs in our accelerator space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We include Taiwan in this grouping because its economic evolution has become something of a beacon for SEA founders who want to build beachheads around the region.</strong> Let’s start with a single statistic to understand why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total e-commerce economy market size in Taiwan is USD$42 billion. This is almost 66 per cent of the size of the entire GSEA combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Founders who emerge in GSEA and come to Taiwan to grow stronger</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This unique attribute of Taiwan is a magnet. There is also a push factor in ASEAN nations. That mechanism is prompting SEA founders to seek out a tested, developed market for their ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movement is observable through growth statistics that suggest a plethora of pent up consumption demand driven by tech adoption and through example companies that have done it. Let’s start with the country data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five countries in GSEA show growth in GDP per capita of over 6 per cent, as of last year. They are Cambodia at 6.83 per cent; Laos at 6.72 per cent; Vietnam at 6.5 per cent; the Philippines at 6.47 per cent; Myanmar at 6.45 per cent. Indonesia and East Timor show growth of 5.2 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Vietnam, a country of 95 million people, many early-stage startups are rapidly developing — Sky Mavis; Axie Infinity; Triip.me (AW#18). Engineering talent that moved overseas and went to tough schools like Harvard have now come back and are starting new companies by the dozens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Indonesia, we have seen the growth of five unicorns, including Gojek and Bukalapak. In other areas, it’s not so straightforward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google recently released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/\" title=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/\">yearly results</a> from a long-term study that looked at the potential for SEA’s growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, seven urban centres drive over 50 per cent of the internet economy in the countries depicted in GSEA. The “beyond metros,” or rural areas of a few SEA countries, account for 85 per cent of the population, but only 48 per cent of the Internet economy, as you can see from the picture below.</p>\r\n<div class=\"al-section al-photo \">\r\n	<figure><img class=\"image fr-fic fr-dii\" title=\"AppWorks\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575358926-92647@900.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575358926-92647@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575358926-92647@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575358926-92647@900.jpg 900w\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n		<figcaption>7 metros account for over 50% of the Internet economy / Photograph : AppWorks</figcaption>\r\n	</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While use cases may exist for tech, and while consumer demand may be growing, it’s harder to really scale in some emerging markets without solid strategies and consistent talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the creativity and innovation ideas are off the charts, many things like stagnant offline players, unavailability of engineering talent, government red tape and just pure infrastructure fragmentation stand in the way of “moving fast and breaking things,” so to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEA founders are coming to Taiwan is because they see a microcosm of development opportunities in Taiwan that they can take back to the rest of Asia, after getting focused here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taiwan was a great gateway to Chinese-speaking countries [in SEA],” says Triip.me founder Hai Ho (AW#18). “There are [also] 200,000 and growing Vietnamese living in Taiwan. There are more daily direct flights between Taiwan and Vietnam, too. It is a good market.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AppWorks startups are gaining momentum in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 376 AppWorks startups have continued to scale and expand by staging in Taiwan through our Accelerator or by becoming one of the AppWorks portfolio companies. Over 1,113 founders in our network have helped the country become a focal point for this region’s growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These companies demonstrate just how nimbly a company locating in Taiwan can grow, figure out e-commerce strategies, and even acquire other companies and engineering teams while nurturing a huge market inside and outside of Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopback (AW#13), the e-rebates payment platform founded by Henry Chan and Joel Leong in Singapore, came to Taiwan to scale up their e-commerce knowledge and market deployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopback has reported annualized sales figures of USD$500 million a year. It has operations in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some other investments include 91APP (Taiwan’s Shopify); Carousell, which has localised to Taiwan by building an office here (it’s also localised in several other ASEAN markets).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is also the kind of place where you can build a company, or two, and IPO them, in a relatively quick time. For example, Jerry Kuo, one of the two siblings that started Kuobrothers, IPO’d in 2016. Jerry then IPO’d a second company that grew out of the original Kuobrothers Group, called MobiX, earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also M17, started by Singaporean Joseph Phua. M17 started as a dating app company called Paktor and was based in Singapore. Joseph merged that company with a Taiwanese company called 17 Media to form what is fast becoming a massive social entertainment company that focuses on live-streaming. A recent acquisition of competitor MeMe Live has brought M17’s live stream market share to over 60 per cent in SEA’s developed markets. That wasn’t the only M17 procurement, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M17 bought AppWorks Accelerator alum FBbuy, a company that developed an innovative way for people to buy items on Facebook. If someone simply typed in “+1,” in a comment, the scanning app would move the coveted item being discussed into a shopping cart. Joseph acquired that company and integrated it into a live-streaming commerce app called HandsUp.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Early-stage is also heading to Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a number of early-stage companies with inherent exposure to SEA who have heeded the call to come to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our upcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45764\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45764\">Demo Day #19</a>, over 65 per cent of the cohort will have originated or started their startup ideas in GSEA. Two female founders offer some examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annie Zhang, from Hong Kong, will pitch Matters Lab as a decentralised platform for media and content sharing, which enables content providers to generate their own immutable content and get paid for it. They’ve generated about 25,000 customers in seven months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telepod founder Jin-Ni Gan, a Malaysian living in Singapore, will also pitch. At a recent mentor day, she showed off her miniEV startup already operating in seven markets in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her last slide was a photo of kids without shoes walking down a dirt road that cut through what looked like smoke from a jungle fire at a rubber plantation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My childhood was similar to this one,” she said, and then ended her pitch with the message that tech and creativity have a strong potential to make this life better for billions of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s a story that is familiar to many founders here in Taiwan, and it’s one that will only scale rapidly in time. As the region grows, the probability that mission-driven founders who are intent on building fast-moving scalable startups will see that Taiwan is a launchpad for the regional market.</p>\r\n<div class=\"al-section al-photo \">\r\n	<figure><img class=\"image fr-fic fr-dii\" title=\"AppWorks\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575359012-53394@900.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575359012-53394@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575359012-53394@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-12/img-1575359012-53394@900.jpg 900w\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n		<figcaption>Jin-Ni Gan, Founder of Telepod, at the AppWorks Accelerator Mentor Day, September 2019. / Photograph : AppWorks</figcaption>\r\n	</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another quick look at the GSEA market landscape should give founders, and investors, something to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the five countries mentioned earlier that have GDP growth north of 6 per cent, three of them — Cambodia, Laos, and East Timor — have mobile internet penetration rates under 40 per cent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myanmar, which has 21 million Internet users, only provides Internet to 36 per cent of its population. Nearly all of those users — 99.8 per cent — get their Internet through mobile phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In emerging market economies, a glut of software and tech availability is enabling founders to test use cases for new technology and consumer products. Often, these use cases employ leapfrog innovations that are further ahead than the traditional infrastructure or tech use cases in developed markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After spending six months in Taiwan, XFers (#18) teamed up with Zilliqa in Singapore to launch a stablecoin. The lack of avenues for remittances makes the mobile form factor an attractive device for gaining access to capital and tapping into new virtual banks and blockchain technologies. Going forward , data seems to indicate that this innovation in SE Asia driven by a connection to Taiwan will be more prevalent. And it will continue to shape fintech and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45795\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45795</a></p>', './img/1081204.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2020-01-30 07:39:55', NULL),

It receives 211 valid responses and serves as a crucial basis for BNext’s annual report on Taiwan’s startup ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p>Among all the surveyed founders, more than half (54.9%) are first-time entrepreneurs. 45.1％ are serial entrepreneurs and almost all of them have 5+ years of work experience.</p>\r\n<p>The average number of members in a founding team is 4.48, while 18 among all the startups are run by only one founder.</p>\r\n<p>34.3% of the members are women, making the ratio between male and female members approximately 2:1. 63 startups are founded by an all-male team.</p>\r\n<p>The average age for all the members in a founding team stands at 34.65, with 23.5 being the youngest and 55 being the oldest among all. The former works on digital ads and the latter is a software company focusing on information security.</p>\r\n<p><strong>In terms of responsibilities, more than half of the members (2.25 out of 4.48) work on the tech side.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Louis Chang, Founder of NewsLeopard, says there were only two people in the team back when he started the company, so he had to work as a developer. It’s a Taiwan-based startup developing a namesake email marketing platform.</p>\r\n<p>Tech background enables him to release minimum viable product (MVP) for market validation with the least possible resources, but this can divert his attention away from understanding what the market really needs, he says.</p>\r\n<p>Cornerstone Ventures co-founder TP Lin tells Business Next he believes tech capability is important but not the only element that pushes startups to success. Business model, core competency, and growth plan are no less pivotal. “It would be great if co-founders have different backgrounds and complement each other,” he says.</p>\r\n<p>When asked about the type of employees their company plans to recruit in the future, they give answers that reflect the known demand of tech talent in the startup scene: 30.8% would like to hire more software developers while 18.9%, 17%, and 14.2% want to bring in BD, marketing, and sales specialists, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The average size of the entire team, including the founding team, is 20.45. Each team tends to hire 2 to 3 interns.</p>\r\n<p>Most startup teams target three vertical markets: B2B solutions (14.2%), AI/data analytics (13.7%), and e-commerce (11.8%). Other include education (8%) and marketing/PR (7.5%).</p>\r\n<p>Around 40% of the surveyed teams serve enterprises (B2B business) and the rest serves end customers either directly (B2C business, 27.4%) or indirectly (B2B2C business, 28.9%).</p>\r\n<p>60% of the startups have launched their product(s), but overall, there are still 47.3% struggling with deficits. Only 33.1% of them have been making profit and expecting steady growth.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45776\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45776</a></p>', './img/1081202-2-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

The first closing is led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture capital firm SOSV, Uni-President Group, and Kyber Capital.</p>\r\n<p>For Uni-President Group, the giant Taiwanese food conglomerate company, BigGo is its second internet investment after the investment in Sea Group, Shopee&#8217;s parent company, in 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The Silicon Valley–headquartered venture capital firm SOSV reinvests. BigGo graduated from MOX Batch 3, an SOSV accelerator for cross-border mobile internet. &#8220;MOX, the Mobile Only Accelerator operated by SOSV helps startups from around the world expand cross border into new markets without spending money on customer acquisition,&#8221; says <a title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45342\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45342\">William Bao Bean</a>, General Partner at SOSV and Managing Director at MOX. &#8220;We have been happy to help BigGo launch into Thailand and hit profitability and excited to see them enter Japan and other SE Asia markets next.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>For Kyber Capital, a global blockchain and financial innovation venture fund, this is the first time investing in the internet industry. Kyber Capital founder Thomas Hu says, &#8220;Kyber sees great prospects in BigGo&#8217;s product vision and development strategy in the vertical search engine category, as well as monetization potential by combining decentralized fintech with big data on BigGo&#8217;s platform.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>BigGo plans to use the funds to further product development and to expand internationally in markets such as Thailand, Japan, and the European Union.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;In 2020, we expect to see a 300% increase in revenue from this year. We also expect a substantial increase in users from 11 million to 25 million users,&#8221; says Kevin Yen, CEO of BigGo.</p>\r\n<p>BigGo currently sells more than 4,500 Shopee orders per day, with a record high of more than 10,000 orders in a single day. Many e-commerce companies experience substantial increases in conversions and revenue growth of their products on the BigGo platform.</p>\r\n<p>BigGo business includes price comparison, cashback, offline price comparison, price history tracking, and extension services. The platform is available in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Thai.</p>\r\n<p><strong>BigGo offers historical price tracking features and price reduction alerts.</strong></p>\r\n<p>BigGo&#8217;s historical price tracking feature allows users to track any product&#8217;s pricing history for up to 90 days. Users can subscribe to price alerts and receive notifications in real-time when pricing has changed, ensuring great buying opportunities will never be missed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The browser extension helps users to buy the best price.</strong></p>\r\n<p>BigGo Helper is a browser extension that will automatically notify and display available discount codes on the checkout page of participating e-commerce sites, BigGo Helper browser extension is available on Chrome and Firefox browsers.</p>\r\n<h2>The Next Step for BigGo</h2>\r\n<p>BigGo started its international expansion launching BigGo Thai in November 2018. Since launching, it has become the top price comparison website in Thailand with an Alexa website traffic ranking of 124 for all websites in Thailand.

Despite its burgeoning tech industry, it seems to have been “discounted.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some see Taiwan’s future differently. A number of well-known international companies, including Google and Apple, have flocked to Taiwan recently to invest and set up operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The concern is how young people here get involved and position themselves that they can work for these companies,” Mr. Seewald added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a step back, the core issue is indeed how Taiwan can cultivate internationally-oriented talent to push itself forward as in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Randall Nadeau, CEO of Fulbright Taiwan, said he believes helping students to study aboard facilitates the process because it unlocks the possibility of “experiential learning,” which simulates creativity and broadens horizons. His foundation provides grants for students and scholars from Taiwan to do educational exchange in the US and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talent cultivation and circulation are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, said Mr. Seewald.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recent years, an educational reform based on a shift of “knowledge-based to competency-based model has been rolled out, said Anting Liu, Founder of Teach for Taiwan. She gave recognition to such move, noting that Taiwanese students will thus be able to leverage their creativity and put what they’ve learnt into practice. In her organization, she also allows student volunteers to develop leadership through teaching kids in rural schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing on her background in leadership and neuroscience, Britt Andreatta, CEO of 7th Mind, pointed out the importance of developing emotional intelligence. “It’s about knowing yourself and managing yourself, and once you do that well, that makes you better at understanding others, building relationships and influencing others,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also suggested that everyone set aside a couple of hours a week for creativity, working on change, or developing themselves as a leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Nadeau said cross-disciplinary learning is another key to cultivating oneself. “For every person who wants to make a difference, the best advice I can give is to develop your curiosity, to want to know about anything,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One should think about what they can do with their own mind. It’s about not only “crossing international boundaries, but also crossing intellectual boundaries,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making Taiwan a magnet for international talent</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While opening possibilities for the Taiwanese to go abroad, it’s crucial to make their hometown a better location for personal growth and career development, which will attract not only them to return and bring back new perspectives but also foreign talent to stay and contribute to the economy. This is in line with another objective that the TCA is working on: to prevent brain drain in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the declining birth rate and aging population, it should be one of the top priorities for the country to remain competitive in the digital era, said Mr. Seewald.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Ms. Liu said she has always felt a sense of pessimism among Taiwanese young people over the country’s future; she encourages a shift in mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If you flip the map counterclockwise, you see a very different perspective. You start to see Taiwan at the center, especially in the digital era, of some of the biggest markets and opportunities from Japan to Indonesia,” she said. “If we liberate ourselves from some of the psychological limitations we put on ourselves, there are great opportunities in Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“That needs to live in the hearts and minds of the people who are here,” Ms. Andreatta responded. “Because as you start to see it, that energetically travels around the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“People want to be where other people are happy and loving where they are and their experiences,” she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Melissa Daimler, Principal of Daimler Partners, said it’s crucial that Taiwan define clearly and intentionally what it has that is nowhere else. It’s what differentiates itself from other cultures that attracts foreign talent to come here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a congresswoman for the ruling party, Karen Yu is working on policies that will practically encourage more foreign talent to work and live in Taiwan, including the Foreign Professionals Act that has come into effect last year. She said she will seek to further include in this Act not only the program that allows foreigners to do internship in Taiwan but one that facilitates the exchange between high tech companies overseas and local startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45674\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45674</a></p>', './img/1081112.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2020-01-30 07:46:22', NULL),

Several months earlier, it has announced entry into Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>With the experience of serving 300+ clients in more than ten industries in Taiwan and Hong Kong, CloudMile has aimed higher. CEO Spencer Liu said next year, the company plans to enter Singapore, where it will break ground on a new headquarter.</p>\r\n<p>He said Singapore has been taking the lead in Asia&#8217;s AI market and establishing headquarter operations here will help CloudMile better keep up with the global trend of tech development. The company is now in transition as it adapts to operational and technical teams built locally.</p>\r\n<p>Ryan Kuo, Deputy General Manager of CDIB Capital Management, said as a platform for startups, the VC firm is optimistic about CloudMile’s capability of providing premium AI and cloud services and believe as CloudMile expands its market in Asia, its AI services will assist more Asian enterprises in innovating their business models. He is looking forward to putting another Taiwanese startup on the global stage.</p>\r\n<p>In Taiwan, CloudMile plans to set up an R&amp;D center devoted to AI technology, especially for gaming, healthcare and retail industries. Liu pointed out that Taiwan&#8217;s healthcare has been considered one of the best in the world, and he hopes to introduce AI to more local startups in this industry and help them expand their global presence.</p>\r\n<p>This year has seen the company buckle down to develop new products for brand owners. With mlytics, it has launched MileCDN, a new multi content delivery network (multi-CDN) platform that optimizes website performance and user experience with enhanced data security.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Read more: <a title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45579\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45579\">CloudMile and mlytics launch one-stop CDN platform MileCDN to optimize web performance and user experience</a></p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This year, it has set up MarTech startup Ainotam and launched Feedlio, an image processing tool powered by AI.

The cost has been plummeting over the past three decades, from some billion to a few hundred US dollars.</p>\r\n<p>The global network of this project so far includes Canada, Austria, China, and the UK, each of which operates independently as a member in a loose confederation. &#8220;We want to have independent lines of language, customs, and laws to be country personalized,&#8221; Mr. Church said. &#8220;It&#8217;s crucial that every country be represented.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>He is therefore optimistic about Taiwan&#8217;s participation in the project, which shouldn&#8217;t be hampered by the size of the country. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t require a lot of money and people but innovation and sharing of ideas,&#8221; he said. With its genetic and environmental diversity, Taiwan may add value to the network and make great contributions to the development of precision medicine.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, he referred to PGP as a &#8220;technology-sensitive project,&#8221; for which one might expect Taiwan, as one of the leading countries in the global ICT industry, can leverage its strength.</p>\r\n<p>Academia Sinica, National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), and several top universities in Taiwan have been planning to form an alliance for a PGP-Taiwan initiative, Chuang Woei-jer, a medical science professor at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and a former director-general of the Department of Life Sciences at the MOST, according to <a title=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/11/03/2003725171\" href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/11/03/2003725171\">Taipei Times</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Church has also promised to visit Taiwan again next year to sign an agreement with the alliance, he said.</p>\r\n<h2>From lab to world of business</h2>\r\n<p>In fact, Mr. Church isn&#8217;t only a scholar and professor of MIT and Harvard but also a profilic entrepreneur who has founded 20+ startups, including <a title=\"https://nebula.org/\" href=\"https://nebula.org/\">Nebula Genomics</a>. His Boston lab, likewise, is more than a space for research but an incubator of startup ideas.</p>\r\n<p>He told Business Next that it&#8217;s an environment where it&#8217;s okay to fail and be disorganized; &#8220;mediocrity is the enemy,&#8221; he said. In such lab culture, central to numerous sucesses he witnesses there, members regard experimentation as a part of their life and commit to thinking outside the box, he added.</p>\r\n<p>Rather than following the sometimes overhyped technology trends created by investors, Mr. Church said he and his team monetize only the ideas and applications that are truly needed by the market.</p>\r\n<p>New-born startups in the lab earn his two to three years of full attention &#8212; until the founders, also his students, are able to run the business independently and think he&#8217;s not necessary anymore, he laughed.</p>\r\n<p>As many of them become a success, a positive feedback has been created: &#8220;all the previous students will come back and help their younger sibilings,&#8221; Mr. Church said. He described it as &#8220;a four-year-old [teaching] a two-year-old how to run,&#8221; but it&#8217;s an effective way for them to learn from each other. With this wonderful family, one can probably see one more startup success emerging from his lab sooner or later.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45634\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45634</a></p>', './img/1081106.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

In cooperation with NiCE (National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association), the “2019 Taiwan Startup Ecosystem Survey X Start up Scale Up in Southern Taiwan” event was held at ICCK (International Convention Center Kaohsiung) on 31st October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event focused on the discussion and comparison of the background and needs of the entrepreneurs of Southern Taiwan in the survey results. In terms of industrial development, Southern Taiwan was dominated by green energy and the IoT (Internet of Things), while north region was dominated by digital media, IoT and e-commerce, and the central part concentrated on smart manufacturing, green energy technology and new agriculture. In addition, the host invited incubator managers from Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung to participate. It also shared the government resources and the results of the southern entrepreneurship ecosystem at the booths. Furthermore, the TSH (Taiwan Start-up Hub) set up a helpdesk for providing consulting services for the guests of the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was one thing worth noting that manufacturers were mainly concentrated in Southern Taiwan, whether it was high-tech industries, heavy industries and other traditional industries all had huge output values. Since the intellectualization had become a global manufacturing trend nowadays, the panel discussion session focused on how to assist the upgrading of the local industries, including the strategic thinking of digital upgrading and development, and how the manufacturing industry should cooperate with the startups. The speakers included the director of Sivann Inc. – Simen Lee, the chairman of Macroblock Inc. – Lichang Yang, LED, and the chairman of Wellgen Medical – Yusen Lin. It created business opportunities for enterprises and interactions for the participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southern Taiwan is now in the critical period of industrial transformation and upgrading, while the SMEs play an important role in economic growth. “SMEA will continue to integrate central, local and private entrepreneurial resources in the future, and strive to provide diversified financial support, tax incentives and international markets connections for startups.”, said Betty Hu, the deputy director general of SMEA.</p>', './img/1081104-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2020-01-17 06:51:01', NULL),

Jerry Peng, CEO of <a title=\"https://tradingvalley.com\" href=\"https://tradingvalley.com/\">Trading Valley</a> started his presentation to Business Next about his Fintech startup with an appalling figure. This is the market he chooses to explore and it&#8217;s enormous not only in size but in potential.</p>\r\n<p>Think about why people would rather save up than invest. It&#8217;s not only that they tend to believe investing exposes them to risks and uncertainty but that they shy away from traditional financial advisors, which charge a high wealth management fee without guaranteeing returns.</p>\r\n<p>But for ordinary people, probably laymen in investing, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to invest on their own while ensuring stable returns, too. They often struggle to pick the types of assets to invest in, let alone forming a portfolio.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in 2014, Trading Valley develops an AI-powered robo-advisor to help people make wiser investment decisions and, as Mr. Peng said, &#8220;to bring technology to the public.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The startup uses an AI model to extract and analyze a huge amount of financial data, including volume-price trends and financial reports available on the Internet, to forecast 18 markets across the globe with more than 70% accuracy. &#8220;We don&#8217;t adopt human perspective (from economists, for example) but have AI technology identity the patterns for us,&#8221; he added. This is a bit different from its competitor Betterment, an NY-based online investment company.</p>\r\n<p>With such technology, Trading Valley works with second-tier banks to offer customized, automated investment services to their clients based on their financial goal and acceptable level of risk in Taiwan. The trained AI model picks out a number of individual stocks, ETFs, and regular funds to ensure 5 to 9 percent annual return. In the US, as a licensed online advisor, they develop strategies for excess return directly for high-end clients; despite a high risk, an annual return from 8 to 20 percent can be expected.</p>\r\n<p>This year, the Taiwanese startup has been selected for the accelerator in Australia: Startupbootcamp Fintech Melbourne. It opens the door for the company to tap into the market in Australia and work with the National Australia Bank (NAB), one of the four largest local financial institutions. Later, it hopes to collaborate with not only banks but securities dealers and asset management centers there. The goal, Mr. Peng said, has been to drive the wave with digital transformation in the financial sector.</p>\r\n<p>At the earliest, Trading Valley will start fundraising (pre-A funding) at the end of 2019 to acquire more B2B clients.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45653\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45653</a></p>', './img/1081104-2.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Users can not only send messages to each other but also manage tasks, share files, and make video calls. Unlike its major competitor Slack, it&#8217;s a people-centric platform that allows them to create and be added into groups as on Facebook.</p>\r\n<p>Business Next had talked with the general manager of the Taiwan branch Masafumi Kawamura back in 2016, more than one year after the parent company welcomed an influx of third-party capital: ¥300M ($3M) from GMO Venture Partners and ¥1.5B ($15M) from GMO Venture Partners, SHINSEI, JAFCO, and SMBC Venture Capital, all of which are from Japan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This year, Chatwork has got nod of approval for initial public offering (IPO) at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in September. Its shares are listed and traded on Mothers, a TSE section for startups.</strong></p>\r\n<p>CFO Naoki Inoue told us that going public may strengthen the company&#8217;s presence in the global market and help them build trust with clients, and these two benefits are mutually reinforcing.</p>\r\n<p>The trust from clients is particularly crucial for an messaging app like Chatwork as it involves the issue of privacy. &#8220;Our mission is to ensure that our communication platform is one that users feel safe while using,&#8221; he explained.</p>\r\n<p>Following its well-supported IPO, the goal for the firm has been clear enough: besides 90% of the efforts in Japan, it expects to grow footprint in other Asian countries, according to <a title=\"https://jp.techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/chatwork-listed-on-tse-mothers/\" href=\"https://jp.techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/chatwork-listed-on-tse-mothers/\">TechCrunch</a>. And they are, for now, Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>\r\n<p>The Vietnam branch was founded in 2016 as well, when the company saw increasing number of Japanese businesses offshore jobs in one of the most fast-growing countries in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Inoue said It&#8217;s only after reaching &#8220;great success&#8221; in Asia will Chatwork proceed to Western markets including Europe and the US, in which the office had been temporarily shut down to ensure a smooth IPO; the marketing plan in the US wasn&#8217;t finalized despite five years of exploration. He defined such success as the time when Chatwork app sees high demand and its user base grows steadily.</p>\r\n<h2>Chatwork&#8217;s three-year journey in Taiwan</h2>\r\n<p>Mr. Kawamura, GM of the Taiwan branch, pointed out that while the clients in Japan are predominantly law and accounting firms, the majority of the users in Taiwan are employees from civil engineering and manufacturing companies, who pay Chatwork for the software service. The app can be used for the communication between factory workers and product designers, for instance.</p>\r\n<p>The company has also started to see university clients employ its service in Taiwan to facilitate the communication between professors and students who work together at labs, as in Japan, where it has collaborated with some at Kyoto University.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of startups as a new target audience, Mr. Kawamura said the team hasn&#8217;t had the plan to reach out to this new group of clients. &#8220;But we are still interested in newly-established businesses from traditional industries,&#8221; he added.</p>\r\n<p>He believes Slack, as a tool designed at first for IT developers, may suit a large proportion of startups in Taiwan as most of them are tech companies.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, ChatWork has been localizing their product to create positive user experience and thus discovered some needs specific to Taiwan. For example, Mr. Kawamura said Taiwanese companies tend to ask to remove the function that enables users to edit and delete messages after posting them in the chatroom — one that is often desirable for their Japanese counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>When asked about the biggest difference between corporate clients in these two countries, Mr. Kawamura said, with a chuckle, those in Taiwan make decisions more quickly. He now drops in on companies that have been utilizing ChatWork&#8217;s service for free, persuading them to pay to enjoy advanced functions and services.</p>\r\n<p>Reference: <a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/38212/BN-2015-12-13-210814-143\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/38212/BN-2015-12-13-210814-143\">1</a>/<a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/42141/chatwork-wants-to-be-the-most-popular-business-instant-messaging-software-in-taiwan\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/42141/chatwork-wants-to-be-the-most-popular-business-instant-messaging-software-in-taiwan\">2</a>/<a title=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/japan-chatwork-ipo-150009/\" href=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/japan-chatwork-ipo-150009/\">3</a><br />\r\n*Source: Research by Fuji Chimera Research Institute, Inc. in 2015.</p>\r\n<p id=\"div-gpt-ad-1566376347784-0\" data-google-query-id=\"CNmKypnhwOUCFcUdKgodajEDww\">〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45622\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45622</a></p>', './img/1081031-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

As the President of Asia School of Business (ASB) in Kuala Lumpur, an MBA program institute in collaboration with MIT Sloan, he also shared his views on how Taiwan can possibly collaborate with Southeast Asian countries after building more connections.</p>\r\n<h2>Entrepreneurship necessary for Asia and the world</h2>\r\n<p>In Asia, the rapid economic growth has opened up numerous spaces for entrepreneurs to tap into the market.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Fine said he sees a great number of &#8220;visionary and ambitious people&#8221; in the region such as Anthony Tan, co-founder of <a title=\"https://www.grab.com/sg/\" href=\"https://www.grab.com/sg/\">Grab</a>, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in 2012, the ride-hailing giant is the first homegrown unicorn in Southeast Asia. &#8220;My sense is that there are going to be dozens of Anthony Tans and unicorns,&#8221; he said.</p>\r\n<p>The startup, through providing alternative means of transportation, offers better mobility for people in Southeast Asia and render them more employable, which echoes the mission of the IIC to empower those who are left behind by global tech progress.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of driving tech progress, entrepreneurs like Tan addresses the pressing social challenges that their society has been facing collectively. Professor Fine believes this is the form of entrepreneurship that should be &#8220;celebrated&#8221; in the future.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s necessary not only for Asia but also for the world plagued by climate change and rising sea level. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have entrepreneurial energy directed to those kinds of challenges, this planet is gonna be a much less possible place to live,&#8221; he explained.</p>\r\n<p>Giving recognition to entrepreneurs tackling the ensuing refugee crisis such as Aline Sara from <a title=\"https://natakallam.com/\" href=\"https://natakallam.com/\">NaTakallam</a>, he urged them to come up with solutions to avoid the detrimental outcome in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, foreseeing the large number of young people entering the labor market in Asia in the upcoming years, he also expects local entrepreneurs and his ABS students to build big organizations and create jobs for them.</p>\r\n<p>With an abundance of business opportunities, Asia will further unleash its potential if the countries in this region &#8220;collaborate with each other and learn from each other&#8217;s cultures,&#8221; Professor Fine stressed. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge benefit to Asia if countries get to know each other better.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In fact, in 2016, Taiwan has rolled out <a title=\"https://english.ey.gov.tw/nsp/\" href=\"https://english.ey.gov.tw/nsp/\">New Southbound Policy</a> to strengthen economic ties with Southeast Asia, South Asia and Australasia. Companies are encouraged and subsidized to set up operations throughout the Indo-Pacific.</p>\r\n<p>While reducing trade reliance on China, the country seeks to build an collaborative relationship with these countries based on the foundation of mutual understanding. &#8220;[Taiwan&#8217;s government has] to work harder to get to know more about each government’s operations and each society’s culture and special characteristics in order to work effectively,” said Minister without portfolio John Deng, according to <a title=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2019/02/the-new-southbound-policy-in-a-new-context/\" href=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2019/02/the-new-southbound-policy-in-a-new-context/\">Taiwan Business Topics</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>How can Southeast Asia and Taiwan collaborate</h2>\r\n<p>As the Policy, which he described to be &#8220;encouraging,&#8221; Professor Fine is also promoting transnational collaborations within Asia in the form of school programs. His ABS students in Malaysia are required to team up with fellows from various cultural backgrounds and develop a project in yet another Asian country.</p>\r\n<p>What they do, he said, is &#8220;building their network in Asia,&#8221; a seed that might grow into actual economic connections. He does believe Taiwan has to know these countries better.</p>\r\n<p>When asked about how they can collaborate, he said Taiwanese companies should bring their industry experience and knowledge to Southeast Asia and run business there.</p>\r\n<p>Amid limited availability of talent, the economic growth of the region is constrained despite great market potential. It&#8217;s probably an opportunity for Taiwan, &#8220;a talent rich nation,&#8221; to contribute, he said.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45592\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45592</a></p>', './img/1081023.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

With its connections with communities, industries and the global market, Startup Terrace has attracted at least 132 domestic and foreign accelerators and startups to move into it. The coming launch ceremony will showcase startups’ new and smart technologies and will present the fruits of startup operations in Startup Terrace, in which infinite creativity is shown for a futuristic city for startups.</p>\r\n<p>Linking up with communities, industries and global markets, and giving startups strong, deep roots in Taiwan.<br />\r\nStartup Terrace is the largest-scale startup village in Taiwan, and includes one joint innovation center as well as 15 international accelerators, making it the startup complex with the largest number of international accelerators in Taiwan. Its resident members also include 99 startup businesses from 10 countries. This entrepreneurs’ village offers both quality customized services in an entrepreneurial environment and the support needed for the process of setting up a startup, which allows startup teams to forge ahead towards their dreams without worries. Besides, through accelerated growth and the cooperation achieved via domestic and international links, the value of startups is enhanced and their dreams are given the best chance to soar.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, Startup Terrace also opens up an opportunity for resident businesses to conduct empirical experiments which link up and cooperate with industries in the surrounding areas within a 2-km radius. With the introduction of international accelerators which assist startups in expanding their global markets, members can connect with the global startup ecosystem. It is hoped that by virtue of linking up with three major players—communities, industries and global markets—the ideas and motivation of resident teams can be inspired and thus Taiwan can be connected to the global market, making it an important base for exchanges and collaboration between international startups.</p>\r\n<p>Linking up with the concerted effort of guests, and lighting up the village’s launch with innovative applications<br />\r\nThe theme for the coming launch event is ‘Link’, which sounds like ‘Linkou’ — the name of the town where Startup Terrace is located. As indicated by the word ‘Link’, it is Startup Terrace’s determination to link up communities, industries and the global market. Additionally, in order to highlight the transformation of traditional industries and initiation of product applications realized by innovation and creativity, the launch ceremony will start with a performance by the Chio-Tian Folk Drums &amp; Art Troupe. Moreover, in response to the theme of the launch event, ‘Link’, the energy of participating guests, startup businesses and community residents will be connected and linked up to ‘Light up Linkuo and Link up Taiwan with the World’.</p>\r\n<p>With the establishment of a comprehensive startup ecosystem and the gathering of global startup energy, Startup Terrace will successfully ‘Link Taiwan and Connect with the World’ by linking up with domestic and foreign accelerators, startup businesses and local industries, and furthermore facilitate the creation of a comprehensive local startup ecosystem and the construction of a microscale smart city in Linkuo. It is our sincere hope that all guests, startup businesses and local communities can be connected together to witness this milestone of Startup Terrace through this launch ceremony. Startup Terrace will also continue its commitment in linking up communities and industries with the global market to make it an iconic international startup village in Asia as well as a ‘dream land’ for innovation and creativity.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Ministry of Economic Affairs〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/news/News.aspx?kind=6&amp;menu_id=176&amp;news_id=87267\">https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/news/News.aspx?kind=6&amp;menu_id=176&amp;news_id=87267</a></p>', './img/1081018-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

He recalled the time when he needed to throw the trash after eating at Wholefoods. &#8220;I stand there trying to figure out where to put my waste and feel like a dummy,&#8221; he described. &#8220;There&#8217;s gotta be a better way to do this.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The majority of people are lousy recyclers, and their poor practices cause contamination. &#8220;You give them two bins, landfill and recycling, they make the right choice 30% of the time,&#8221; Yhap laughed, though it&#8217;s a 50/50 shot. Although, for example, there are attempts to clean up contaminated recyclables in the US, they&#8217;re not successful either, and 80% of such waste still ends up in the landfill.</p>\r\n<p>With AI, computer vision, and sensors, his Trashbot separates trash three times (90%) more accurately than human being, helping facilities like airports, stadiums, and universities sort recyclables from landfill waste. When the Trashbot is full, it changes color to signal its status and sends notification to an online dashboard and SMS to relevant personnel.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;These types of buildings (their facility customers) are facing a confluence of pressures,&#8221; Yhap said, to recycle correctly, including zero waste goals, mounting landfill expenses, and the public hoping for more sustainability. &#8220;This trend is the world wants better recycling management.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Facility managers are therefore excited about this product, not only because of the costs it saves but the access to a large amount of data that wouldn&#8217;t be possible before. &#8220;They can start making data-driven decisions,&#8221; Yhap explained. &#8220;We are pulling the value not from commodities and the waste itself but from the insights that can be generated.&#8221; For example, they can craft sustainability strategies based on them.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, for small business owners, they won&#8217;t be fined by waste haulers for the contaminated waste their customers create. Trashbot enables a new layer of transparency that improves the B2B relationship.</p>\r\n<p>Yhap said he believes the social good and profit model are &#8220;mutually reinforcing&#8221;, and he can lead people to a better future with his smart bin. This is in line with the view of Gordon Yu, VP &amp; CSO of <a title=\"https://www.evptechnology.com/\" href=\"https://www.evptechnology.com/\">EVP Technology</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>A technology turning trash into fuel</h2>\r\n<p>To begin with, Yu pointed out the problem resulting from contaminated waste again, but he isn&#8217;t fazed at all — because the system called R-ONE developed by his team can turn it into a better type of fuel, which not only costs the same as petroleum-based diesel but produces less emission. With higher combustion efficiency, it also increases horsepower for vehicles without generating black smoke.</p>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_10248\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10248\" class=\"wp-image-10248 size-full\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3.jpg 900w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-10248\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gordon Yu, VP &amp; CSO of EVP Technology / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p></div>\r\n<p>Yu&#8217;s company, EVP technology, now processes over 25 tons of plastic waste every day and generates seven kiloliters of regenerative energy. It contains 10 ppm sulfur, much lower than the fuel used in ships (10,000 ppm). &#8220;We are making the air 1,000 times cleaner,&#8221; he said.</p>\r\n<p>In the system, 80% of the plastic waste can be converted into eco-friendly diesel for sale instead of being burnt in incinerator and generating dioxin while the rest serves as the fuel for the system to run without relying on external power supply. &#8220;The result is zero waste and zero emission,&#8221; he stressed.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;there&#8217;s no need to do cleaning and sorting.&#8221; Cleaning contaminated plastic materials can cause secondary pollution, and sorting is not only difficult to the majority but meaningless when plastics will be veritably recycled only if they&#8217;re clean.</p>\r\n<p>Despite waste segregation, all types of trash can still end up together in the landfill, he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to reach sustainability without profit,&#8221; he said.</p>\r\n<p>EVP manages to strike a balance between the social good and profitability. Indeed, if Taiwan&#8217;s government allows their &#8220;unconventional&#8221; oil to be branded and enter the diesel market, he believes they will work closely with corporates like Formosa Plastics and CPC Corporation (the state-owned petroleum company) and no plastic waste will be seen in Taiwan anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan has been promoting biodiesel since 2008. This type of fuel is sourced from low quality oil like used cooking oil, and has thus brought about numerous complaints for causing flameout and clogging the tubes in the car engine a few year ago. Biodiesel made from crops isn&#8217;t better. Besides competing with food crops, it costs double the price of regular diesel because it&#8217;s mainly imported.</p>\r\n<p>If the policy is properly made, he believes their diesel should be the &#8220;best pathway to circular economy,&#8221; in which waste is eliminated and resources are continually reused. Countries don&#8217;t have to shy away from export waste anymore because it can all be turned into fuel by EVP&#8217;s technology, including waste that flows from land into the ocean.</p>\r\n<p>Embracing &#8220;blue economy,&#8221; the company is now looking for opportunities to contribute to the world by helping other countries go plastic free.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45523\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45523</a></p>', './img/1081007-1080x652.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

His advice are as follows — First thing first, the Southeast Asian market should be considered separately. Many of us may deem ASEAN as a whole market while the culture, environment, religion, and market are diverse to do so. Secondly, without wholehearted preparation, you wouldn’t want to bounge into a new market. Given that the equity agreements often require partners of local nationality to hold up to 49 to 51% of the shares, each enterprise shall think twice. The point is to find a local partner, especially a trustworthy one to cooperate. Last but not least, we need to verify information ruthlessly. Due to its environment and languages, startup information in those countries is not as transparent as Tawian’s. Before any cooperation plan comes into play, due diligence is strongly recommended to manage potential risks.</p>\r\n<p>Ever since its establishment, <a href=\"https://startboard.co/\">STARTBOARD </a>has kept in contact with international talents from ASEAN countries, so as to accumulate the human resources from international talents. In this way, when global talents join in a Taiwan company or startup, they showcase the bonus to connect with ASEAN market and partners and also provide accurate information as well as experiences to live up to the demand of “southbound.”</p>\r\n<h2><strong>【NEW SOUTHBOUND POLICY – PLAN AHEAD AND DON’T MAKE IT COMPLICATED】</strong></h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2276\" src=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg?w=1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" srcset=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg 597w, https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg?w=150 150w, https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg?w=300 300w\" alt=\"許博鈞\" data-attachment-id=\"2276\" data-permalink=\"https://startboard.co/2019/09/02/taipei-entrepreneur-exchange-conference-all-the-way-to-the-south-and-the-key-to-success/%e8%a8%b1%e5%8d%9a%e9%88%9e/\" data-orig-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"597,395\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"許博鈞\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/e8a8b1e58d9ae9889e.jpg?w=597\" /><br />\r\n(Xu Bozhen, CEO at Rooit)</p>\r\n<p>Rooit is committed to developing mobile applications and dating systems and was selected to play a part in TechStars.

Mr. Xu also shared his insights into the Singaporean market based on their experiences. The following are some focal points that determine whether your expanding would go smoothly into ASEAN market.</p>\r\n<p>To begin with, the pivot is market research and estimation. The strategies should either depend on population, geographical location or on the questionnaire. Secondly, when the targeted market has limited resources, then we shall narrow down the range.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, Mr. Xu mentioned the significance of “speed.” More often then not, startups struggle to maintain daily operation so adaptability to the latest trends and the development with efficiency count.

The sponsors include the local government and well-known Japanese enterprises like Dentsu, ANA Holdings, Bandai Namco Holdings, Fuji Media Holdings, Takashimaya Company, The Keiyo Bank, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Following the funds from Japanese travel agency H.I.S. and LINE Ventures, KKday CEO Ming Chen said, this investment will boost the company&#8217;s overall growth and its further development in Japan.</p>\r\n<h2>KKday sees a growing demand for activities in Japan</h2>\r\n<p>The recent three years have witnessed a fivefold increase in Taiwanese tourists visiting Japan. Chen also told Business Next that the number of tourists entering Japan for KKday&#8217;s services in the first half of 2019 has outgrown that for the entire 2018.</p>\r\n<p>In light of the large number of repeat travelers, KKday has noticed the need to provide more locally run activities that enable travelers to enjoy authentic Japanese culture, too.</p>\r\n<p>With the support from the Japanese government and investors, the company expects to be given the access to more resources to develop in-depth travel experiences that wouldn&#8217;t be available without this new partnership. The tours can thus include cultural activities that are difficult to book in advance or not offered to foreign tourists at all.</p>\r\n<p>Cooperating with local partners, including big companies, will enable the company to earn the trust in B2B and B2C relationships, which is highly crucial in Japan, Chen said. He proposes to cooperate with a total of 10,000 activity providers in three years.</p>\r\n<p>Cool Japan Fund regards KKday as an important investment partner in inbound tourism for its excellent capabilities in activity planning and execution, CEO Naoki Kitagawa said.</p>\r\n<p>For the upcoming Olympics in Tokyo, it&#8217;s working towards the government&#8217;s goal to attract 40M tourists and add ¥8T (approximately $75B) tourist spending to its annual income.</p>\r\n<p>By financing businesses across four main areas (media &amp; content, food &amp; services, fashion &amp; lifestyle and inbound tourism), the fund aims to expand Japan&#8217;s impact on the global market.</p>\r\n<p>It seems that Japan has opened doors to KKday, but there are still challenges lying ahead, including the possibility to own the exclusive rights to sell the products developed with the help from new partners.</p>\r\n<p>Reference: <a title=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Cool-Japan-Fund-to-invest-10m-in-Taiwanese-travel-site-KKDay2\" href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Cool-Japan-Fund-to-invest-10m-in-Taiwanese-travel-site-KKDay2\">1</a>/<a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54572/kkday-funding-2019-august\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54572/kkday-funding-2019-august\">2</a></p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45358\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45358</a></p>', './img/1080902.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

As a part of this partnership, it promised to connect Owlting with the local government and companies for the team to develop the market in the Middle East.</p>\r\n<h2>How blockchain can improve the aviation industry</h2>\r\n<p>In our previous interview with CEO Darren Wang, he said the system should work similarly as <a title=\"https://www.owlting.com/owlnest/en\" href=\"https://www.owlting.com/owlnest/en\">OwlNest</a>, the company&#8217;s hotel management service launched in 2017.</p>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_10151\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10151\" class=\"wp-image-10151\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1080827-2-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1080827-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1080827-2-768x507.jpg 768w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1080827-2.jpg 786w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-10151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Darren Wang, founder and CEO of Owlting / Photograph: Business Next</p></div>\r\n<p>Nowadays, most online hotel booking sites, including Agoda, Booking.com., and Expedia write the data of their orders into a property management system. Causing delay, the gap between the time when the data are submitted and written prevents the platform from synchronizing and can therefore lead to overbooking.</p>\r\n<p>On OwlNest, the data are instead written into a private Ethereum blockchain and managed by Smart Contract. The platform can be linked to external systems to increase efficiency and prevent human error in processing orders.</p>\r\n<p>Wang believes this cooperation is an exceptional opportunity for Owlting to gain presence. On the World Expo 2020 hosted by Dubai, it will show the global community how it applies blockchain in various fields and build a city fully powered by this technology.</p>\r\n<h2>Building a blockchain city in two years</h2>\r\n<p>The UAE government has held a positive attitude towards the application of new technologies. In the previous cabinet reshuffle, the first AI Minister in the world was appointed.</p>\r\n<p>In 2016, the Crown Prince of Dubai H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed inaugurated Smart Dubai, a strategic plan that aims to turn Dubai into a smart city by 2020. A number of public and private services will soon be handled on blockchain platforms, ranging from visa application to real estate transaction.</p>\r\n<p>SEED Group&#8217;s CEO Hisham Al Gurg said the firm is excited to explore new technology with Owlting and looking forward to a fruitful cooperation.</p>\r\n<p>Headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, OwlTing is operating globally through its branch offices in the USA, Japan, Malaysia, Sweden, and Thailand. For this 10-year-old company, the partnership with the royal family of Dubai is considered a key milestone. Within two years, it&#8217;s expected to go public on NASDAQ and become the first unicorn from Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Reference: <a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54437/owlting-partnership-with-seed-group-to-drive-blockchain-adoption-in-the-uae\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54437/owlting-partnership-with-seed-group-to-drive-blockchain-adoption-in-the-uae\">1</a>/<a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54024/owlting-founder-talk-about-ipo\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/54024/owlting-founder-talk-about-ipo\">2</a></p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45328\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45328</a></p>', './img/1080827.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

The commute is leashing the efficiency of work and time-consuming. Working at home creates other problems because home is not a professional working environment. Also, working at home has many disadvantages like the distractions, work-life mixups and so forth. Regus spotted the enormous demand of the flexible working space. Regus provides satellite offices for businessmen to work in their co-working space. By building co-working space all over the world, Regus does not only offer alternative office space for its members but also provides geographic-advantage and flexible working space. The new trend of co-working space is taking down the wall of conventional offices, facilitating communication among different industries and broadening the horizon of business.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>【GERMAN – THE CENTER OF EUROPE INDUSTRY】</strong></h3>\r\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-2258 alignleft\" src=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=172&amp;h=255\" sizes=\"(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px\" srcset=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=172&amp;h=255 172w, https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=344&amp;h=510 344w, https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=203&amp;h=300 203w\" alt=\"4.JPG\" width=\"172\" height=\"255\" data-attachment-id=\"2258\" data-permalink=\"https://startboard.co/2019/08/01/unleash-the-power-of-innovation-in-taiwan-international-startup-meetups/4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"345,511\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;u80e1u807fu5a01&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1564396427&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=203\" data-large-file=\"https://startboard.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/4.jpg?w=345\" />Mr. Goller is the senior manager of Market Entry Service at German Trade Office Taipei.

He mentioned that the number of South-East Asian talents in Taiwan has increased from thirty thousand to sixty thousand since 2015. Well-educated professionals are seeking for a better connection with the integrated high-tech supply chain in Taiwan. Staying in Taiwan is their first step to open the grand Chinese market. When it comes to “international markets,” many people only think about the U.S.A and Europe; however, Venture Capitals gradually shift their capitals to fast-growing markets like South-East Asia and India. Mr. Lin said, “There are three things VCs looking for in a startup. First, <strong>courage and confidence</strong> are the fuel to overcome the struggles in entrepreneurship and help you through the obstacles with agility. Secondly, <strong>the balance of bold ambition and practical strategy</strong> is important. You have to be keen on the new trend and carefully set forth your plan both financially and strategically. At last, <strong>business reputation and credibility</strong> is the baseline. There is nearly no VC would make an investment on startups which have a dishonest or unethical history.”</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2262\"

(73, 'New Economic Immigration Bill', '2019-02-21', 'news', '<p>The impact of Taiwan’s low birth rate and population aging is growing increasingly evident. The country’s working age population began to fall after reaching its peak in 2015. The total population is projected to start exhibiting negative growth in 2022, with the working age population falling below 66.7 percent of the total population in 2027, bringing the period of its demographic dividend to an end.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan urgently needs to respond to these changes in the demographic structure, and to the difficulties caused by pronounced shortages of the technical talent required by domestic industries, by recruiting and supplementing high-grade foreign talent and manpower to augment the human resources needed for national development. As a means to boost industrial upgrading, maintain a reasonable population structure, and raise national competitiveness, this is a vital objective that brooks no delay.</p>\r\n<p>The New Economic Immigration Act (herafter referred to as “this Act”) will relax and broaden the applicable scope of regulations governing qualification to work and stay in Taiwan, access to permanent residence, rights of dependents, and other aspects of the treatment offered to foreign professionals, foreign mid-level technicians, overseas compatriots, and investment immigrants. Also, given that regulation of economic immigration is currently dispersed among various immigration laws and regulations, this new act will serve to enhance administrative efficiency and focus policy implementation by bringing together all pertinent provisions in a single statute, thereby adding greater force to recruitment efforts.</p>\r\n<p>To better attract the foreign professionals needed for the digital economy era and the rapid shift in business models, it is proposed to liberalize the categories of industry and occupation in which their employment is permitted, with adoption of a negative list approach. In addition, a points system will be utilized for screening the work qualifications of foreign professionals, to establish more diverse employment conditions, and capital and turnover requirements will be relaxed for employers in key industries, to help businesses recruit the kinds of high-caliber international talent they need.</p>\r\n<p>To solve the shortage of mid-level technical manpower needed by domestic industries, reference was made to international practices in mapping out proposals for the employment of foreign students and basic-level foreign personnel who possess mid-level technical work skills, or for directly importing foreign nationals with mid-level technical work skills. Such kinds of technical manpower will all have to meet requirements of salary level and work qualifications. There will also be a total number cap and individual industry quotas. With regard to the direct import of mid-level technical manpower from abroad, the schedule and scope of this will be separately announced by the Executive Yuan, depending on the situation of employment of the other two aforesaid types of technical manpower and the development needs of domestic industries.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, considering the large number of our compatriots residing overseas, and that there are many among them with prime skills and expertise, who ought to be actively targeted for recruitment, this bill proposes relaxing the current entry permit,registered permanent residence and other rules applicable to overseas compatriots who possess ROC nationality under the provisions of the Nationality Act.</p>\r\n<p>On the basis that investment immigrants come within the scope of economic immigration, and is also an object of active promotion by the government, but considering that Taiwan’s current avenues and conditions for investment immigrants are already quite diverse and relaxed compared to neighboring countries, current regulations relating to investment residency, permanent residency and registered permanent residence are integrated in this bill to achieve the purpose of policy declaration.</p>\r\n<p>The bill proposes relaxing conditions pertaining to permanent residency, dependents, and so on for foreign professionals, as well as stipulating conditions for permanent residency of mid-level technicians, and conditions for residency and permanent residency of their dependents. For foreign nationals who obtain permanent residency, it proposes providing ancillary measures of Employment Insurance and new labor pension system coverage and relevant social security and living assistance, to establish a friendlier immigration environment.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :National Development Council 〕</p>\r\n<div style=\"width: 1080px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]-->\r\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-9642-1\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/22a587d8-84bb-4fb4-b4b7-1208a5fbfc71.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/22a587d8-84bb-4fb4-b4b7-1208a5fbfc71.mp4\">https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/22a587d8-84bb-4fb4-b4b7-1208a5fbfc71.mp4</a></video></div>', './img/1080222-1-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

The tariffs are expected to take effect in late September following hearings and a public comment period that ends on September 6.</p>\r\n<p>The list includes a wide range of consumer goods including car tires, furniture and bicycles. If the tariffs go into effect, they add to existing tariffs worth US$34 billion on Chinese components and US$16 billion worth of semiconductors and other products that took effect on August 23.</p>\r\n<p>The list of products slated for tariffs also includes popular consumer electronic devices including connected speakers and wearables, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials, while smartphones and computers so far have not been included. Goods manufactured by Apple, activity tracker maker Fitbit and speaker brand Sonos have been named.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, the retail price of these products may increase and the profit of OEMs, which manufacturer for brand name companies, could decrease. Several Taiwanese OEM companies are considering reducing their dependence on China and diversifying their manufacturing locations.</p>\r\n<h2>Compal Electronics: wait and see</h2>\r\n<p>Compal Electronics is a key part of the supply chain that makes Apple Watches as it completes their final assembly in Chinese factories. It is not considering relocating Apple Watch production to another country, said Ray Chen, the vice chairman of Compal Electronics.</p>\r\n<p>The production line for smart watches is very long and complicated, making it difficult to relocate. The company doesn’t have enough labor and factory space for this production on its home turf in Taiwan, either, said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>“Everybody is waiting (for the results of the hearings),” said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>If the new tariffs go into effect, there will be an impact on products shipped to the U.S., but not those that go to other regions.</p>\r\n<p>Computers are currently not slated for tariffs. Compal Electronics, which mainly assembles computers, would consider increasing production in factories in Mexico and Poland if computers are added to the list, said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>If computers are required to be shipped and be assembled in places other than China, manufacturing costs would increase at least 3%, said Chen. Compal Electronics produces 40 million computer products every year.</p>\r\n<h2>Pegatron to increase production outside China</h2>\r\n<p>Another OEM, Pegatron Corporation, which produces consumer electronics, including iPhones, iPads, laptops and smart watches, is already considering the U.S.-China trade war in its business planning.</p>\r\n<p>The company plans to increase production in factories located in Mexico, Czech Republic and India if it is forced to decrease production in China.</p>\r\n<p>It has also bought several factories in Taiwan within one year, including OEM company Inventec Corporation’s factory Daxi and networking manufacturer Arris’s factory in Xindian. Therefore, its Taiwan locations could also provide production support.</p>\r\n<p>“We have established plans for short-term and long-term,” said Lian Sih-Jheng, the CEO of Pegatron Corporation.</p>\r\n<p>The company&#8217;s short-term revenue would definitely be affected owing to factory adjustments.

Sustainable Development Goals were highlighted in a speech by Minister without Portfolio Audrey Tang Sept. 21 at New York-based Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>\r\n<p>According to Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, efforts to establish an open and multistakeholder governance system align with SDG targets 17.6, 17.17 and 17.18, which encompass such objectives as boosting international cooperation on and access to technology and promoting effective public, public-private and civic society partnerships.</p>\r\n<p>Open government, social innovation and youth engagement can ensure citizens have a meaningful input in policymaking, Tang said. The minister pointed to several Taiwan developments in this regard, including the establishment of the participation officer network, public officials in each ministry designated to engage with civil society on emerging issues; and the Social Innovation Lab, a facility for fostering new social enterprises and hosting public meetings on related government initiatives.</p>\r\n<p>Growing citizen-government collaboration, Tang said, is delivering tangible benefits. She highlighted successful efforts to improve the online tax filing system through the participation officer network, as well as the launch of an air quality website displaying real-time atmospheric data collected by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration and from over 2,000 measurement devices operated by members of the public.</p>\r\n<p>Following the speech, the minister took part in a Q&amp;A session hosted by Daniel Russel, ASPI vice president and former U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Among the topics discussed were promoting technological innovation in rural communities, and how Taiwan’s strategies for collaborative governance can be implemented in developing countries through low-cost hardware solutions.</p>\r\n<p>The event was among a series of addresses by Tang in New York. She spoke the previous day at the Technology and Social Innovation for Sustainable Development forum at Columbia University, and at a Sept. 22 panel on digital governance staged by a Taiwanese-American community organization based in the city.</p>\r\n<p>Tang’s participation in the New York events was arranged as part of a campaign by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs themed U.N.

The tariffs are expected to take effect in late September following hearings and a public comment period that ends on September 6.</p>\r\n<p>The list includes a wide range of consumer goods including car tires, furniture and bicycles. If the tariffs go into effect, they add to existing tariffs worth US$34 billion on Chinese components and US$16 billion worth of semiconductors and other products that took effect on August 23.</p>\r\n<p>The list of products slated for tariffs also includes popular consumer electronic devices including connected speakers and wearables, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officials, while smartphones and computers so far have not been included. Goods manufactured by Apple, activity tracker maker Fitbit and speaker brand Sonos have been named.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, the retail price of these products may increase and the profit of OEMs, which manufacturer for brand name companies, could decrease. Several Taiwanese OEM companies are considering reducing their dependence on China and diversifying their manufacturing locations.</p>\r\n<h2>Compal Electronics: wait and see</h2>\r\n<p>Compal Electronics is a key part of the supply chain that makes Apple Watches as it completes their final assembly in Chinese factories. It is not considering relocating Apple Watch production to another country, said Ray Chen, the vice chairman of Compal Electronics.</p>\r\n<p>The production line for smart watches is very long and complicated, making it difficult to relocate. The company doesn’t have enough labor and factory space for this production on its home turf in Taiwan, either, said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>“Everybody is waiting (for the results of the hearings),” said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>If the new tariffs go into effect, there will be an impact on products shipped to the U.S., but not those that go to other regions.</p>\r\n<p>Computers are currently not slated for tariffs. Compal Electronics, which mainly assembles computers, would consider increasing production in factories in Mexico and Poland if computers are added to the list, said Chen.</p>\r\n<p>If computers are required to be shipped and be assembled in places other than China, manufacturing costs would increase at least 3%, said Chen. Compal Electronics produces 40 million computer products every year.</p>\r\n<h2>Pegatron to increase production outside China</h2>\r\n<p>Another OEM, Pegatron Corporation, which produces consumer electronics, including iPhones, iPads, laptops and smart watches, is already considering the U.S.-China trade war in its business planning.</p>\r\n<p>The company plans to increase production in factories located in Mexico, Czech Republic and India if it is forced to decrease production in China.</p>\r\n<p>It has also bought several factories in Taiwan within one year, including OEM company Inventec Corporation’s factory Daxi and networking manufacturer Arris’s factory in Xindian. Therefore, its Taiwan locations could also provide production support.</p>\r\n<p>“We have established plans for short-term and long-term,” said Lian Sih-Jheng, the CEO of Pegatron Corporation.</p>\r\n<p>The company&#8217;s short-term revenue would definitely be affected owing to factory adjustments.

(86, 'Siemens Gamesa to Help Taiwan Meet Costly Goal of Installing Offshore Wind Power', '2018-09-21', 'news', '<p>Wind power generation has become a cornerstone of Taiwan&#8217;s renewable energy policy, with specific targets set for 2025, as the government chases Paris Agreement carbon reduction targets.</p>\r\n<p>But developing offshore wind power has its cost, roughly double that of onshore production. It costs more because energy must be moved from turbines at sea – and periodically repaired.</p>\r\n<p>It also comes with technical challenges such building as corrosion-resistant towers, offshore moorings and kilometers worth of cables to connect turbines to the power grid. Taiwan aims to generate 5.5 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2025.</p>\r\n<p>But according to a Siemens <a title=\"https://www.energy.siemens.com/br/pool/hq/power-generation/renewables/wind-power/SCOE/Infoblatt-what-is-the-real-cost-of-offshore.pdf\" href=\"https://www.energy.siemens.com/br/pool/hq/power-generation/renewables/wind-power/SCOE/Infoblatt-what-is-the-real-cost-of-offshore.pdf\">report</a>, some countries will generate up to 100.5 gigawatts, making Taiwan a minor player in the global market. Projects also face high costs for repairs and transportation of supplies.</p>\r\n<p>To help Taiwan develop wind power offshore, which also eliminates complaints about noise and blight that might hobble onshore projects, the Spanish firm Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy hosted a one-day forum for supply chain partners, signaling a commitment to the local market.</p>\r\n<p>Its officials described ways to overcome some of the barriers, including growth of a local supply chain.</p>\r\n<p>Siemens Gamesa is the second largest global wind turbine manufacturer in the world with a strong presence in India and a growing position in the United States, according to a report. In fiscal year 2017 the Spanish company generated revenue of US$7.5 million. In Taiwan, the company already sold two turbines for an offshore wind project led by Swancor Corp. near Miaoli county.</p>\r\n<p>Siemens Gamesa operates about 2,300 offshore wind turbines worldwide, according to a company press release.</p>\r\n<p>The Swancor project called Formosa Phase I started commercial operation in April 2017. The Spanish firm will sell 20 turbines next year 2019 for phase two, according to a company press release.</p>\r\n<h2>Local supply chain</h2>\r\n<p>This increased demand for the firm’s turbines has prompted Siemens Gamesa to solidify its local supply chain. Typically, a wind turbine has some 8,000 parts and can stand as tall as the Statue of Liberty, according to a website operated by the US Department of Energy.</p>\r\n<p>The size of many parts, such as blades, motors, and tower components, makes local sourcing essential due to otherwise high transportation costs. Quality matters, too, because repair work can be tough, so many manufacturers ask for parts certification and check to make sure the equipment is sound.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;The quality of the components is very important,&#8221; said Niels Steenberg, general manager of offshore wind power for then Asia Pacific, at the Siemens Gamesa localization event. Repair work, he said, requires renting a boat at US$300,000 a day for a week.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s lack of a deep-water harbor for offshore wind turbine installation adds a setback. Siemens Gamesa signed a memorandum of understanding with the state-owned shipping company, Taiwan International Ports Corp., in late 2017 to overcome that issue.</p>\r\n<p>Siemens Gamesa’s work in Taiwan will benefit a small local supply chain today with 6 local suppliers and 4 international firms who recently signed MOUs with the company. But those numbers could soon expand, Steenberg said.</p>\r\n<p>Many other turbine makes are eager to enter Taiwan, as it plans to develop offshore wind power in 12 places, mostly on the west coast, according to a European Chamber of Commerce Taiwan report “Energy for the Next Generation.”</p>\r\n<p>Asia’s offshore wind power market is getting bigger every year, Steenberg told the event as cited by <a title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/50174/siemens-gamesa-offshore-in-taiwan\" href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/50174/siemens-gamesa-offshore-in-taiwan\">Business Next.</a> The market in Asia is lags Europe by about 10 years, he added.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43623</a></p>', './img/1070927-4.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Asus executives hoped the change would sharpen the company’s focus on each of these businesses and improve efficiency.</p>\r\n<p>The latest financial results show the restructure has not harvested any results. They also indicated three challenges Asus needs to overcome.</p>\r\n<h2>Delayed supply chain</h2>\r\n<p>Development of Asus’s last two flagship smartphones was delayed when a supply chain was switched from Taiwan to China, causing them to be released in the second half of the year, facing competition from new iPhones from Apple and Samsung’s Galaxy Note series.</p>\r\n<p>Later on, its latest flagship smartphone and related series, the ZenFone 5, 5Z and Max Pro, were launched at a good sales time in April this year. They performed well in India, Indonesia and Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>The company relocated final assembly in its supply chain to China in order to lower manufacturing costs and thus the price of its smartphones to compete against lower-cost brands, including China’s Xiaomi. But the Chinese company could not produce devices fast enough and Asus could not respond to consumers&#8217; orders worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>To solve this problem, Asus has hired Jerry Tsao, a former Intel sales and marketing regional head, as chief operating officer this January. The new executive plans to set up a 200-strong team to improve supply chains in China and hopes to solve this issue by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>\r\n<h2>Unstable executive team</h2>\r\n<p>The management at Asus is going through a rocky patch as the company struggles with succession issues. Asus Chairman Jonney Shih, 66, has postponed a planned resignation for a year.</p>\r\n<p>Asus for years had only been focused on traditional hardware design and development. Now that AI is seen as the main future technology in the industry, ASUS is under pressure to integrate AI into its products and services to keep up to date.</p>\r\n<p>New technologies require fresh talent. Shin has recently brought several relatively young employees into his executive team and gradually established a new decentralized corporate structure, but it is still too early to see if this will bring results.</p>\r\n<p>In other restructures, Asus added a new business unit known as “business computer” into its systems business group this April, in the hope to sharpen its business focus.</p>\r\n<p>The company meanwhile is still looking for a chief marketing officer to handle its global communications.</p>\r\n<p>Shih also promised the restructure was for responding to market changes and there would be no lay-offs.</p>\r\n<h2>Networking device subsidiary experiences continuous losses</h2>\r\n<p>One of the biggest drags on profits was Askey, an Asus subsidiary selling electronic and network communications products. Its financial losses reached US$20.4 million (NT$612 million) this quarter.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in 1989, Askey has manufacturing sites in Taipei, Taiwan, and Suzhou, China as well as big clients like Verizon. It was once a profit-making venture in 2016, before seeing losses for six consecutive quarters totaling US$72 million(NT$2.16 billion)</p>\r\n<p>Shih said operation adjustments at Askey were taking longer than expected, without giving details, and he promised a better financial performance by the fourth quarter this year at the earnings call.</p>\r\n<p>Investors are waiting Asus to deliver better financial results in the second half of this year. The trade war between the U.S. and China, however, have caused currency depreciation around the world, which will impact on Asus’s total profits from its global retail channels.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43613</a></p>', './img/1070927-3.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Some people are afraid of it. But AI can already extract topics from documents, just to name one example, and every big name in high tech is trying to develop it.</p>\r\n<p>Animashree Anandkumar, principal scientist at the Amazon.com subsidiary Amazon Web Services and a California Institute of Technology professor, spoke at the <a title=\"https://www.diftaipei2018.org\" href=\"https://www.diftaipei2018.org/\">2018 Digital Innovation Forum</a> in Taipei July 20. Business Next did a Q&amp;A with Anandkumar at the event about what AI means, what’s next for the technology and what she is doing with it.</p>\r\n<h2>Q: How should people think about artificial intelligence?</h2>\r\n<p>When we talk about artificial intelligence, we need to think, first of all, what is intelligence? I think there is a lot of confusion about what is artificial intelligence and what is not artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>(I gave) an example of a Boston Dynamics Atlas robot, which is a very sophisticated robot that can do backflips. Then I contrasted it with a dog that actually fumbled a ball. The message is the dog is intelligent but the Atlas robot is not, because the robot is being programmed. The point is: The ability to acquire knowledge and build on skills, and learn more from the surrounding world, is intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>Once we have that clarification of what intelligence is, we can then ask ourselves what does artificial intelligence involve? I talked about how the trinity— data, algorithms, infrastructure — is fuelling artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>Usually when people think of AI, they only think of the algorithm. But without data, without the internet, we wouldn’t have had our deep learning systems. Without GPUs, we would not have had deep learning. All these three have to come together.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Where do we go next? What is the future?</strong></p>\r\n<p>At Caltech, we have recently launched a program called CAST, the new Caltech Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies. It’s a new initiative from Caltech launched in October last year.</p>\r\n<p>The Centre for Autonomous Systems and Technology is looking at the future of artificial intelligence—the idea of bringing mind and body together.</p>\r\n<p>Machine bodies like robots we have right now is mostly the body without the mind. The question is how do we bring artificial intelligence and robotics together? I think that’s going to be the future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What are some of the projects you’ve been working on?</strong></p>\r\n<p>At Amazon Web Services, I’m involved with several projects, including Amazon Rekognition and Amazon SageMaker. I’ve built many core algorithms including work for topic modelling.</p>\r\n<p>What this algorithm does is you can use a bunch of documents and extract the topics automatically. This work was based on my research, which I have published before. It was good to see that one of the research projects done five years ago can now be turned into a reality.</p>\r\n<p>My company Amazon Web Services has a partnership with Caltech and has funded over US$200 million to Caltech faculty and students.</p>\r\n<p>I’m proud to say that Amazon Web Services has funded over 40 proposals across the Caltech campus. There’s just so many fascinating usages and applications of machine learning. I look forward to seeing more of interesting research coming out from the community.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Microsoft set up an artificial intelligence (AI) research and development center in Taiwan in January. In March, Google announced it will hire 300 people in Taiwan and train 5,000 Taiwanese students in artificial intelligence programming. I’m curious, what is Amazon doing in Taiwan?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Well, we don’t comment on our competitors, and I personally cannot comment on Amazon’s engagement with Taiwan. I know that there has been an innovation center being set up early this year in Taipei. Amazon is a big company. But I would say that Amazon is interested in enabling AI across the globe.</p>\r\n<p>I would like to see more grassroots-driven open source projects emerging from the AI community.</p>\r\n<p>I think we need to make it very easy for anyone—high school students, college students, engineers and scientists—to get started with machine learning. And of course, if Taiwanese governments are making growing the AI talent pool a priority, I think it’s a move in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43395</a></p>', './img/1070912-6.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

A lawmaker says it would save overseas investors money and hassle on making currency conversions.</p>\r\n<p>But their ideas are not the only ones. A proposal in Taiwan for an official coin faces opposition from people who believe crypto should stay decentralized.</p>\r\n<p>Linking cryptocurrency to official units such as the new Taiwan dollar can make them more easily convertible, ideal for trade rather than just speculation, Lee told Business Next. Sweden, Israel and Russia, and others, have backed national digital currencies.</p>\r\n<p>Tether’s USDT, a cryptocurrency coin linked one-to-one to the U.S. dollar, he notes, can do this function.</p>\r\n<p>Skeptics of a government-backed coin believe it would violate the decentralization principle of digital currencies.</p>\r\n<h2>Legislator’s support</h2>\r\n<p>Taiwan opposition party legislator Jason Hsu also advocates issuing a “Taiwan Dollar Digital Coin” primarily for financing cross-border trade.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan&#8217;s manufacturing industry spends a lot on U.S. dollar-to-Taiwan dollar conversions, which the digital coin could do, Hsu says in the same Business Next article. The digital coin could do this transaction, he said, and blockchain could potentially replace the letter of credit.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese investors with overseas income should try for a way to avoid exchange rate volatility, he said.</p>\r\n<h2>A role for blockchain</h2>\r\n<p>But the establishment of an official currency requires agreement on technical matters such as building a blockchain or distributing the coin on an existing blockchain.</p>\r\n<p>The public blockchain should offer enough security if provided with enough people to mine the currency, said Lee, whose started the world’s sixth biggest crypto unit. He says it’s not cost-effective to pay for mining a Taiwan currency due to the risks.</p>\r\n<p>A government-supported blockchain in Taiwan could expand the sector as a whole and let crypto traders capitalize upon advantages over neighboring China, Lee said.</p>\r\n<p>Lee worked before as an engineer for the San Francisco-based digital currency trading platform Coinbase. He remembers how Coinbase had trouble opening a local currency bank account in Taiwan and rejections by local banks.</p>\r\n<p>Unclear regulations coupled with the “conservative attitude” by local banks made it difficult for Coinbase to establish operations, Lee said.</p>\r\n<p>The lawmaker says a developed blockchain sector can bring tourists to industry summits.</p>\r\n<p>He cites the <a title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-valley-s-zug-to-run-switzerland-s-first-blockchain-based-municipal-vote\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-valley-s-zug-to-run-switzerland-s-first-blockchain-based-municipal-vote\">Swiss city of Zug as an example.</a> More than 200 blockchain organizations are registered in the area, bringing industry events that translate to tourism revenue.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan has potential, Jason Hsu said, as at least three blockchain companies contact him every week with an interest in expanding in Taiwan. He agreed that unclear regulations have prevented them from coming to Taiwan, leading some of those companies to other markets.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43582</a></p>', './img/1070912-4.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

It should help Taiwan meet demand for talent, he told a news conference. Parliament will review the act, with an eye toward passage, in its session that begins in September.</p>\r\n<p>The Taiwan population is expected to decline from about 23 million to fewer than 20 million by 2035, Lai said, and the government needs a bill to help backfill a dearth of skilled workers left by that fall. Their arrivals in Taiwan would help spur economic growth, he said.</p>\r\n<p>About 120,000 additional mid-level workers would ideally reach Taiwan, National Development Council Minister Chen Mei-ling said. Mid-level skilled workers cover technical assistants, drivers, machine operators and skilled assembly line workers.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Taiwan has long opened its job market to professional talent as well as migrant workers in the manufacturing, construction, social welfare and home care sectors, but not to mid-level skilled workers,&#8221; Chen told the news conference.</p>\r\n<p>Births in the first quarter of 2018 dropped several thousand from the same period of last year, Chen said. Taiwan&#8217;s population growth rate will begin to turn negative in 2025 if the trend continues, she said.</p>\r\n<h2>Draft immigration bill</h2>\r\n<p>Lai’s proposed bill includes measures to let more foreign investors as well as technical personnel and other professionals work in Taiwan. As of May, over 680,000 foreign workers were in Taiwan, according to government statistics.</p>\r\n<p>According to a report by Taipei-based Central News Agency, officials say the bill also would let migrant skilled workers apply for permanent residency, naturalization, and visas for family members.</p>\r\n<p>The bill spells out looser requirements for permanent residency, as well. Foreign talents who wish to apply for permanent residency are now required to stay in Taiwan for five consecutive years. The proposed bill shortens that period to three years for certain professionals.</p>\r\n<p>The rules cover all nationalities except workers from mainland China. They do apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau. Mainland Chinese must follow the Regulations Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the People of the Mainland China Area, Chen said.</p>\r\n<p>Under the current rules, foreigners can apply for permanent residency in Taiwan only if they work here for at least seven years and stay at least 183 days a year.</p>\r\n<p>To apply for permanent residence in Taiwan under the draft bill, a worker in the social care sector must make at least NT$32,000 (US$1,070) per month, and an industrial sector worker must earn a monthly minimum of NT$41,393.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43345</a></p>', './img/1070903-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Airbnb brings house owners and travelers together&#8230; Mediot connects medical people and users,” said Cary Hsieh, who founded Mediot in April 2017.</p>\r\n<p>It will be available in the Taiwanese market in August. Users will be able to access the service from their smartphones or computers.</p>\r\n<h2>An Uber-like Platform in the Healthcare Sector</h2>\r\n<p>It is normally easy to find medical treatment in Taiwanese towns as they have densely-located clinics and hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>However, this easy access has caused some people to over-use medical resources, causing doctors to be overburdened and preventing some people in urgent need of help from receiving immediate medical attention.</p>\r\n<p>Hsieh said medical resources could be used more efficiently if patients who don’t need comprehensive personal checkups go online for some consultations. The company thus developed iHAC to eliminate unnecessary trips to hospitals and clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Mediot estimates some 60% of medical consultations and tasks can be conducted long distance using telecommunications technologies and 14% of them can be conducted online.</p>\r\n<p>For example, some patients with chronic diseases need consultations with several doctors to fully understand their diagnoses.</p>\r\n<p>It normally takes several days involving lengthy commutes to meet each doctor in person. With iHAC, users can communicate with multiple doctors online without leaving home in a much shorter period of time.</p>\r\n<p>iHAC also provides online consultation services. Users can determine the hospital department or clinic they need to visit for treatment of their symptoms. This avoids tedious queuing behind hospital information desks.</p>\r\n<p>Mediot is also cooperating with various doctors who perform physical examinations. After patients&#8217; consultations, doctors explain their reports online through iHAC, eliminating the need for a second hospital visit.</p>\r\n<p>The app can also simulate real medical consultations on mobile devices by using augmented reality technology when presenting some items, such as X-Ray files.</p>\r\n<p>The app has been created in accordance with U.S. legislative requirements for the protection of data privacy and related security provisions.</p>\r\n<p>After this, Mediot joined 2017 Taipei Next Star, a startup accelerator program supported by the Taipei City Government&#8217;s Department of Economic Development.</p>\r\n<p>Mediot&#8217;s founder Hsieh said he first became inspired to work with telemedicine after he earlier developed a wearable device that could detect uterus contractions. After he patented his invention, he found there was not much interest in Taiwan’s healthcare sector.</p>\r\n<p>Although it saved time for doctors, they needed to spend extra time checking online reports. He realized his invention and other wearable devices were more useful if they were used in long-distance treatments.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;When there is distance between patients and medical service providers, healthcare wearable devices really have values. For example, with patients who have high blood pressure and diabetes, doctors can know more precisely their daily blood sugar levels, temperature and blood pressure variations if patients wear wearables.&#8221;</p>\r\n<h2>Taking iHAC to the Chinese Market</h2>\r\n<p>Hsieh sees potential in the vast Chinese market.

It’s expected to help Robo Web make LnB more mainstream, company founder and CEO Joanna Yang said.</p>\r\n<p>The 3-year-old online lending service differs from traditional lenders by offering peer-to-peer lending—also known as P2P lending. That process lets people borrow money from other individuals instead of from an institutional lender.</p>\r\n<p>“LnB’s goal is to enable customers with funding needs to find lenders with ease and convenience over the internet,” Yang said at an event in May. “The spirit of financial technology is to create new values for customers.”</p>\r\n<p>LnB, which stands for Lend &amp; Borrow, is Taiwan’s largest online peer-to-peer lending platform according to a report in Taiwan’s Business Weekly. LnB was founded in 2015 and a year later it landed a multi-million-dollar series A round funding from Acorn Campus Ventures.</p>\r\n<p>The lending service had 37,000 customers as of mid-May and had helped arrange more than NT$5.1 billion (US$170.61 million) in loans.</p>\r\n<p>LnB faces competitions from large and established players such as the world’s biggest online lender LendingClub, the second largest lender Social Finance, and San-Francisco based lender Prosper.</p>\r\n<h2>Details of the deal with Standard Chartered</h2>\r\n<p>As LnB’s first bank partner, Standard Chartered will be able to use LnB to attract younger customers to apply for bank loans online.</p>\r\n<p>Customers will first apply for LnB loans and those rejected will be passed on to Standard Chartered for reapplication, all via the LnB online system.</p>\r\n<p>LnB representatives will be able to recommend the bank’s personal loans options to customers who got rejected from the peer-to-peer service. LnB says its loan approval requirements are stricter than those of commercial banks. But the peer-to-peer service calls its process faster and easier compared to that of a bank.</p>\r\n<p>Yang, 49, is the former manager of Far Eastern International Bank’s personal banking. She brings more than 20 years of extensive banking industry experience to her startup.</p>\r\n<p>LnB targets customers ages 20 to 50 for loans. The application process gives newer borrowers a sense of how much money they should ask for, Yang said. Approval takes as little as three-and-a-half minutes and the loan can be delivered in 24 hours, she said.</p>\r\n<p>Standard Chartered hopes to do more with digital banking as it’s a new trend, the bank’s personal banking head for Taiwan Kate Lin told a media event in May. Online banking was valued at US$64 billion in 2015 and could hit US$1 trillion in 2025, according to a Taipei Times report.</p>\r\n<p>“We aim to reach out to the general public through the strategic cooperation, a departure from the past focus on high-net-worth individuals,” Lin said. “The partnership shows that the bank is serious about growing its personal banking business in Taiwan.”</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :meet@Tw〕</p>', './img/1070730-2.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

In the first quarter of this year, there was another resounding loss of NT$927 million.</p>\r\n<p>“We were too slow turning from web to mobile, and weren’t powerful enough,” said Jan Hung-tze, PChome Online’s chairman at a recent start-up social event held by Meet.</p>\r\n<p>The company was once a star player in the Taiwanese market. Founded in 1996, it began as a portal website. It later spun off its e-commerce platform, PChome Store in 2010 as a separate company.</p>\r\n<p>PChome Store went on to become the first port of call for Taiwanese online shoppers searching the internet for product information, even outdoing Google which came in second, according to a survey conducted last year by the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting Institute, a non-governmental organization in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>The survey also found that when Taiwanese online shoppers wanted to buy a given product, most would click on PChome Store first, before trying Google and Yahoo!.</p>\r\n<p>The company claims its e-commerce site offers the widest range of goods in Taiwan with more than 240 million purchase options. In addition to a business-to-consumer platform, PChome Online offers customer-to-customer transactions, where anyone using its platform can sell their individual belongings to another netizen, similar to eBay in the U.S.</p>\r\n<h2>Shopee Comes to Taiwan</h2>\r\n<p>Storm clouds appeared on the horizon when Singapore’s Shopee, originally an e-commerce platform offering customer-to-customer transactions, entered the Taiwanese market in October 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Owned by Sea Group, a Singaporean internet company which has China’s Tencent as an investor, Shopee’s e-commerce transactions are conducted via a mobile app.</p>\r\n<p>In this way, Shopee successfully differentiated itself from other Taiwanese e-commerce businesses, including PChome Store, which mostly used web platforms and didn’t provide mobile-friendly interfaces.</p>\r\n<p>Consumers found using an app was useful: buyers could quickly text sellers any questions they might have and sellers could reply directly using the app’s messaging feature. And this could be done anywhere provided users were carrying mobile devices, such as smartphones.</p>\r\n<p>Shopee managed to attract hordes of new online sellers through social media. These kinds of people habitually did not use web platforms like PChome Store.</p>\r\n<p>Shopee also entered the Taiwanese market with a strategy of offering free delivery, which Taiwanese companies hadn’t thought of offering before. It spent overall NT$6 billion on marketing in Taiwan from 2016 to early 2018.</p>\r\n<p>By July 2016, Shopee was claiming to have over 3 million app downloads and 10 million transactions every month in Taiwan. Then, in February 2018, the company claimed its app had been downloaded 12 million times, making it the most downloaded e-commerce app in the nation. During the same month, 15 million items in Taiwan were sold through Shopee.</p>\r\n<p>In 2017, Shopee started to charge some delivery fees, then in March 2018 it announced a new business-to-consumer 24-hour delivery shopping service in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>To catch up with this foreign competition, PChome Store began to provide free deliveries and cut product prices while increasing its operation costs. Meanwhile its losses mounted.</p>\r\n<h2>It&#8217;s Like a &#8220;Battle&#8221;</h2>\r\n<p>Jan said that creating a successful e-commerce platform is like a “battle,” with the victor the company able to throw the most resources into marketing, free delivery and cheap deals.</p>\r\n<p>Amazon, an U.S. e-commerce giant, was an example, Jan said. The company started its business selling books online discounted at 20% to 40% It spent money offering these discounts to encourage consumers to change their behavior and make online purchases rather than visit bookstores.</p>\r\n<p>“The purpose of massive investments is to change consumers’ behavior. After the user base has gained enough scale, the platform … probably wins the market,” Jan said.</p>\r\n<p>However, Taiwanese internet businesses had never participated in such a “battle,” nor spent large chunks of capital in investing in marketing, as Shopee did, Jan said.</p>\r\n<p>“So when this came, we didn’t know how to respond,” Jan said.</p>\r\n<p>Shopee is not yet profitable. It pours investment into its business aiming for rising sales as its costs are mounting. However, sales figures and growth are the language its executives use to talk its investors to make them believe it will make money in the future, Jan said.</p>\r\n<p>Sea Group, Shopee’s parent company, which went public in 2017, is positioning itself as a leading internet company in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n<p>“It has reach in the Southeast Asian region and Taiwan,” said Jan.</p>\r\n<p>E-commerce businesses tend to be more profitable investments in internet-savvy Taiwan compared with Southeastern Asian nations, with total numbers of e-commerce sales in the nation 20% more than total retail sales.</p>\r\n<p>“Shopee can tell a very valuable story to its investors. When it works, it isn’t expensive to spend NT$6 billion in Taiwan (on marketing),” said Jan.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43213\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43213</a></p>', './img/1070719-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),
(108, 'CEO of New York-based AI Startup Graphen Offers Tips for Taiwanese Entrepreneurs', '2018-07-17', 'news', '<p>Lin Ching-yung was once chief scientist at IBM’s prestigious research headquarters, the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.</p>\r\n<p>He never imagined that one day he would found a company in the U.S. but after working for IBM for 17 years, he started to see entrepreneurship opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>He founded <a title=\"http://www.graphen.ai\" href=\"http://www.graphen.ai/\">Graphen</a> one year ago offering advanced AI technologies based on graphs. The company’s website says graphs play a key role in mimicking the human experience of intelligence.</p>\r\n<p>Lin recently shared his experience of being a U.S.-based Taiwanese entrepreneur with Business Next at his firm&#8217;s New York headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>The main thing Taiwanese entrepreneurs need to know is that they should not solve industrial problems by offering existing solutions that everyone’s already heard of, Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, startup founders need to think deeply and outside-the-box to come up with original solutions that exceed both customers’ and the markets’ expectations, Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, Taiwanese founders should locate their businesses in target markets that are abundant with talent.</p>\r\n<p>Giving Graphen as an example, Lin said he chose to locate his company in New York as his company is a technology startup that creates AI solutions for the financial industry.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s no exaggeration to say that New York is the perfect place for us to launch because it’s the financial capital of the world,” Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>“Graphen’s success comes partly because its AI talent hails from the computer science departments of top-tier American universities.”</p>\r\n<p>Lin said he was endeavoring to create unique AI technologies to help major banks counter money laundering.</p>\r\n<p>“Large banks are …facing challenges such as countering laundering and debt management. These are the bank&#8217;s key ‘pain points’ that still need to be solved,” Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s important to ask yourself: is your solution solving a real ‘pain point’?”</p>\r\n<p>Many major banks are looking to startups to for new technology in response to the cutting-edge technologies used by American regulators and other government officials to catch banks that are not following the rules.</p>\r\n<p>This follows a series of scandals. Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined US$10 billion for its involvement in a Russian money-laundering scheme. Taiwan’s Mega Bank also got fined US$29 million by the US Federal Reserve for violating an anti-money laundering act in January.</p>\r\n<p>Lin noted that top U.S. banks are more interested in collaborating with startups than smaller banks in order to keep up with the latest technology and competition.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;In New York, the bigger the banks are, the faster they rush in. In part, it’s because they can’t afford to slow down. It’s a highly competitive environment. They need to innovate as fast as they can. You will find that only small and medium-sized banks are conservative and reluctant to change,”Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in June last year, the firm’s success in part comes from Lin’s extensive industry experience and his well-established reputation in both the IT industry and the financial services sector.</p>\r\n<p>Graphen develops AI-powered financial technology platforms for a number of purposes that include monitoring of core banking functions, loan risk prediction and anti-money laundering. There’s also AI-enabled regulation and compliance, fraud detection, market intelligence and AI trading.</p>\r\n<p>“Artificial Intelligence technologies quickly evolve. Inspired by the human brain being a graph of billions of nodes and trillions of edges, our R&amp;D has focused on achieving AI through novel graph computing foundations since mid 2000s,”Lin said.</p>\r\n<p>“With a graph structure, computers can better emulate the full function of human brains, including memory, sensing, recognition, perception, comprehension, and strategy,”</p>\r\n<p>Besides his role at Graphen, Lin has also been an adjunct professor at Columbia University since 2005 and at New York University since 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Headquartered in New York, Graphen. currently has branches and subsidiaries in Taipei, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, and Austin.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43204</a></p>', './img/1070717-3.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Plans to Help Taiwanese Entrepreneurs Break into the American Market', '2018-07-13', 'news', '<p>Austin-based startup accelerator <a title=\"https://www.steepaccelerator.com\" href=\"https://www.steepaccelerator.com/\">STEEP!</a>, otherwise known as the Supporting Taiwanese Entrepreneurs Everywhere Project, plans to invest in seven Taiwanese startups within the next two years.</p>\r\n<p>The accelerator’s co-founder Erica Liu spoke with Business Next during the <a title=\"https://www.computextaipei.com.tw\" href=\"https://www.computextaipei.com.tw/\">2018 Computex Taipei</a> trade show earlier this month. The interview took place at the XR Express Taiwan Pavilion, sponsored by Taiwan’s National Development Council.</p>\r\n<p>The pavilion showcased the latest trends in augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality technologies from 15 young companies. There was also a series of forums on industry trends and startup communities, where Liu was one of the speakers.</p>\r\n<p>The following Q&amp;A explains STEEP!’s background and what it plans to do:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:Tell us about yourself? What inspired you to found STEEP! in 2017?.</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: I&#8217;m a Taiwanese American currently based in Austin, Texas. My childhood was spent in Taiwan and then I moved to the US when I was nine years old. My background is in international tax. I have a Master&#8217;s degree in professional accounting from University of Texas at Austin. I’m also one of the founding members of the Austin Chapter of Taiwanese American Professionals (TAP).</p>\r\n<p>In March 2017, I helped Taiwanese companies connect with the largest tech conference in Austin known as South by Southwest or SXSW. I observed that Taiwanese companies tended to make great products but lacked networks and resources that could enable them to enter U.S. markets.</p>\r\n<p>My friends and I then started to think about how we could use our strong professional networks in the States to help Taiwanese companies grow. What would it be like if Taiwanese startup founders had mentors and partners in the U.S. that they could reach out to whenever they needed help?</p>\r\n<p>As the founding president of TAP in Austin, I’m constantly seeking ways to empower Taiwanese Americans or Taiwanese who wish to tap into the American market. And that’s how STEEP! was born.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:What&#8217;s your goal? Your vision?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: We think that many people with Taiwanese heritage have a proven track record in the U.S. A lot of great companies like NVIDIA and YouTube were created by talented Taiwanese Americans. What STEEP! wants to do is empower Taiwanese startup founders to take their companies to the global stage, which is vital for their future success.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese entrepreneurs can become successful internationally but they need access to knowledge, resources and funding beyond Taiwan. Our vision is to help the Taiwanese startup ecosystem become more like the Israeli ecosystem, where founders give back.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:What are some of the programs that STEEP! Accelerator has been working on?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A:At STEEP!, an online solution we provide is called “STEEP! Web,” which helps accelerate your path to exploring the U.S. market.</p>\r\n<p>STEEP! Web is a web platform and database that fosters a sense of community and mentorship between US entrepreneurs, business leaders, community leaders and Taiwanese founders so that they can learn from each other. We make introductions for seed stage to Pre-A companies needing a network for growth.</p>\r\n<p>We also have a mentoring program where Taiwanese startup founders have a unique chance to get advice with mentors on a one-on-one basis. It&#8217;s a great way for entrepreneurs to reflect on their business strategy, marketing strategy and product development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:How many Taiwanese startups have you invested in? What&#8217;s the size of your fund?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: So far we have invested in only one Taiwanese startup company. But our investment is not only limited to Taiwanese-founded companies in Taiwan. We also consider the U.S., and elsewhere in the world. Companies we invest in will be supported by mentors from our STEEP! Web network.</p>\r\n<p>We are still fund raising. Startups can expect angel check sizes to be US$25, 000 to US$50,000. Right now our total capital is $US75,000. We plan to invest in seven Taiwanese startup companies this year and next year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:What are some of the sources of your funding?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: Our funding comes from Taiwanese American high-net-worth individuals. It&#8217;s U.S. culture to allocate a portion of your wealth to risky projects. Our angel investors tend to be folks who want to invest not only in a good idea but also in the community they represent.</p>\r\n<p>A lot of them have very traditional jobs, as well. Many of them are lawyers and doctors. For them, making their way in the U.S. was diligently working their way up to the top, but they realize that someone else&#8217;s dream may be something entirely different. They want to help future generations shape their dreams in the U.S., as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:Tell us about the startup you&#8217;ve invested in?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: We have invested in a Taiwanese startup company called <a title=\"http://www.bioinspira.com\" href=\"http://www.bioinspira.com/\">BioInspira.</a> They are a chemical sensing IoT company. What they do is use virus technology to detect specific air chemicals. In particular, they can pinpoint chemical leaks. Right now, they are developing ammonia sensors that are used in cold warehousing to ensure industrial safety.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:What’s the biggest challenge Taiwanese entrepreneurs face when approaching an American investor?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: The biggest challenge that Taiwanese founders face when approaching an American investor is crafting their story. It&#8217;s about story telling. I think language is a big barrier. When I do see Taiwanese companies do well at this is when they specifically seek out a co-founder who is very skilled at pitching and sales. I honestly think the biggest barrier is just language. Also, entrepreneurs should be able to charm an audience: they should essentially have story-telling skills.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. investors tend to look for something that is obvious. They want a good bet. Why are you the best person to solve this problem? What kind of special advantage do you have compared with everyone else? These are some of the things that they look for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:What’s next for STEEP!?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: We are currently in talks with the managers of Taiwan Startup Stadium (TTS) and SparkLab to grow the startup community and to help more Taiwanese founders get access to people based in the U.S. I think that hiring people may be our biggest challenge and leveraging the existing pool of talent is one thing we&#8217;ll be working on.</p>\r\n<p>We’re looking to invest in more startups and so getting recommendations from friends or from our networks is something we&#8217;ll be doing too.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43183</a></p>', './img/1070717-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

(114, 'Experts: Taiwan’s Startups Need More Exposure to Marketing, Business Ops, Silicon Valley', '2018-06-11', 'news', '<p>Taiwanese startups lack proper marketing, exposure to the Silicon Valley and an appetite for business risk, experts here said after a global survey pointed to shortfalls.</p>\r\n<p>Business Next reporters reached out to the experts for insight following the release of the Global Startup Ecosystems Report 2018, an analysis of more than 60 startup ecosystems in 24 countries.</p>\r\n<p>The sum of the startup and exit values of new firms in Taipei comes to $580 million, the survey found. That’s less than the global median of $4.1 billion, Hong Kong’s $2.2 billion and New York City’s $71 billion. The number of startups in Taipei ranks between 150 to 350, as compared to a global average of 1700. Hong Kong placed at 450 to 850.</p>\r\n<h2>Silicon Valley exposure</h2>\r\n<p>Chien Chih-yu, Taiwanese venture capitalist with Silicon Valley-based AME Cloud Ventures, said last month that Taiwanese entrepreneurs must pay special attention to investment trends in his part of the United States. A lot of Taiwan’s startups use high tech, which is the sector that anchors Silicon Valley.</p>\r\n<p>“Don&#8217;t just keep your head down and do everything on your own,” Chien said, as cited in an April 18 commentary by Business Next editor James Huang. “If you don’t know what the mainstream investors are looking for, for example, what the hottest topics are, or the latest trends in investing, it’ll be difficult to stay relevant.”</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan needs mostly to send more people for longer periods to the Silicon Valley to observe the tech scene closely and make connections, Chien said. Today, he said, Taiwanese founders normally send just one or two project coordinators for short stays.</p>\r\n<h2>Marketing and business skills</h2>\r\n<p>Taiwan is good at developing core technologies, another expert said, but it takes good marketing and business operation skills to sell that technology overseas.</p>\r\n<p>“The emerging technologies and innovations require a different approach to develop because of (the) unique market,” said Jordan Wen, professor with the Graduate Institute of Technology, Innovation &amp; Intellectual Property Management at National Chengchi University in Taipei.</p>\r\n<p>“Taiwanese startups can no longer rely solely on technologies to enter the market,” Wen told the Business Next editor in an interview. “They have to take operation skills along and consider the means of business strategies before the can finally break into global markets.”</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese startups that recruit foreign talent to Taiwan should further consider how those employees eventually fit in, Wen added.</p>\r\n<p>“For instance, Taiwanese would converse in Mandarin during meetings and work discussions,” he said. “What is the design that we can create for international talents in hopes of lowering the frustration of blending into Taiwanese culture? What are the educational options for their children? How can we help their spouses quickly adapt to the society?”</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s legislative Yuan passed the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals in October to let foreigners interested extend visas for work in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan faces challenges growing its startup ecosystem because many top talents graduating from prestigious universities such as National Taiwan University would rather enter big corporations than work for high-risk startup companies, cultural commentator Chia-chun Chang said.</p>\r\n<p>Younger graduates are keener on meeting their parent’s expectations, including pursuit of careers that provide stability.</p>\r\n<p>“The education system of Taiwan’s entire country, from elementary schools, middle schools to higher education, has stressed too much on unquestioned obedience, getting credits and marks, and focused too little on creativity, self-exploration, and experimentation,” Chang told Business Next. “The system has to change in order to nurture and prepare the next generation of creative leaders in Taiwan.”</p>\r\n<p>The survey released in April amalgamated the voices of more than 10,000 startup founders as well as data from startup database Crunchbase and data company Orb Intelligence. The results are geared to inform public and private decision makers about how to build vibrant startup ecosystems.</p>\r\n<p>Note: Business Next helped the survey organizer Startup Genome, a U.S.-based organization that researches startup ecosystems. The Taipei-based media group acted as a representative of Taiwanese startup ecosystem and contributed to the survey during the second half of 2017.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :meet@Tw〕</p>', './img/1070611-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

ALMEX in turn will integrate FunNow’s hotels and activities booking list in Taiwan into its service, so Japanese visitors can book in Taiwan through the Japanese interface.</p>\r\n<p>“Partnering with ALMEX will be FunNow’s best strategy to enter the Japanese market,” FunNow co-founder C.C. Chang said in an official statement.</p>\r\n<p>FunNow currently offers booking services in major cities in Taiwan as well as Hong Kong and Okinawa &#8212; a small, outlying part of Japan.</p>\r\n<p>The Taiwanese firm says it can make bookings at more than 2,000 establishments including the Marriott and W hotel chains. The Taiwanese baseball team Chinatrust Brothers also accepts FunNow bookings.</p>\r\n<h2>Expanding in Japan</h2>\r\n<p>ALMEX’s manages properties for more than 4,200 hotels in Japan.</p>\r\n<p>In 2007 it established a own hotel booking website, which has become one of the biggest in Japan. According to FunNow’s statement, the site has almost 1.8 million members and does bookings for 6,800 hotels.</p>\r\n<p>ALMEX hopes its work with FunNow can offer more hotels to members who visit Taiwan. Some of its members now book massages, restaurants and bars near their hotels.</p>\r\n<p>For FunNow users from Taiwan and Hong Kong, they will see hotel options from ALMEX when traveling to Japan. The platform plans to add ALMEX hotels first in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, then gradually expand to other cities in Japan.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan, more than 4.5 million Taiwanese visited Japan in 2017.</p>\r\n<p>This tie-up is not the first between Taiwanese and Japanese companies. EZTABLE, a restaurant booking service in Taiwan, received investment in 2016 from Ikyu.com, a Japanese website for restaurants and hotel reservations.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese tourists can use the FunNow service to reserve a table in restaurants in Japan, and Japanese can reserve them in Taiwan using ALMEX.</p>\r\n<h2>Future expansion in Asia</h2>\r\n<p>FunNow’s app and website show hotels, restaurants and events with space within 24 hours. Customers may be able to grab a discount, too.</p>\r\n<p>FunNow users browse offerings on the platform, reserve and pay within the app. Then they can just visit the dining places or event locations with a series of code they receive after payment, and start their activities.</p>\r\n<p>FunNow links its half-million to 2,000 hotels, restaurants and events.</p>\r\n<p>The firm raised more than US$1.5 million in pre-A round of funding in 2017. China Development Financial Holding Corp., a Taiwanese investment firm, led the round.</p>\r\n<p>FunNow expanded outside of Taiwan for the first time last year. Today 15% of FunNow users are from Hong Kong and Okinawa.</p>\r\n<p>FunNow plans to extend its services to Southeast Asia as well as Japan this year.

Acepodia’s result is called ACE-T.</p>\r\n<p>Acepodia describes its invention as “armed” receptors that make T-cells to combat cancer cells, according to a press statement.</p>\r\n<p>The therapy, though not yet clinically proven, shows through lab experiments the potential to be more effective than current therapies, Hsiao said. It will be clinically tested next year, according to a Business Next report.</p>\r\n<p>Doctors normally prescribe chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancers in advanced stages. These treatments usually come with side effects such as hair loss, nausea and abnormal blood cell counts. The T-cell therapy could become an alternative treatment for lung cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Acepodia’s T-cell therapy process should take two to three hours on a cancer patient, Hsiao said.</p>\r\n<p>The former chemistry Ph.D. from the University of California Berkeley believes that startups have what it takes to fight cancer with T cell therapy. “I think startups should be extremely effective at fighting and should always remember our goals and visions,” said Hsiao in a report, recalling the years when Acepodia itself was just starting.</p>\r\n<p>Hsiao also received a chemical engineering degree at National Taiwan University. He co-founded Acepodia with Matthew Francis, a professor of chemistry and executive associate dean in the college of chemistry at UC Berkeley.</p>\r\n<p>The company staff has doubled to 12 people since its founding and set up R&amp;D teams in California as well as Taipei.</p>\r\n<p>The company has joined researchers for animal testing and evaluation at hospital labs, including those at Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley, said Hsiao.</p>\r\n<p>He added that the company is looking forward to using the staff and laboratories of Taiwanese hospitals to advance his therapy among local medical practitioners.</p>\r\n<p>Acepodia faces competition from established players such as cancer-drug maker Gilead Sciences and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, a California-based cancer-immunotherapy biotech.</p>\r\n<p>Hsiao’s firm raised more than US$33 million in series A funding from several Silicon Valley-based venture capitalists in 2015.

Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand All Say Here', '2018-05-17', 'news', '<p>Young entrepreneurs looking to enter Asia can choose from a list of welcoming countries. Leaders based in four of those markets made their cases in April.</p>\r\n<p>Startup scene veterans from Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan showed April 18 at the Taipei event “Battle of the Ecosystems” to speak for their home markets – as well as caution founders about potential obstacles.</p>\r\n<p>The venue for the event held by <a title=\"https://www.startupstadium.tw/overview\" href=\"https://www.startupstadium.tw/overview\">Taiwan Startup Stadium</a>, a government-backed organization that coaches Taiwanese startups, left standing room only as young entrepreneurs packed in to get insights on how each startup ecosystem works.</p>\r\n<h2>Japan in market of its own</h2>\r\n<p>Japan offers startups a solid regulatory environment, technically skilled workers and a laboratory for blockchain-based technology, said <a title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42773\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42773\">Joseph Huang, a venture partner with Japan-based Infinity Ventures.</a></p>\r\n<p>With offices in Tokyo, Beijing and Taipei, Infinity Ventures is an investment fund that helps internet startups focused on Asian markets.</p>\r\n<p>In Japan, however, business people must get used to ambiguous maybes and other indirect communication, Huang said. Business development can be slow, too, especially when it comes to getting go-aheads from partners, he cautioned.</p>\r\n<p>A contract in Japan can take six to 12 months for completion, he added, but Japanese partners are “extremely efficient” once they’re on board.</p>\r\n<p>Despite Japan’s reputation for inventing new technology, the country’s consumers are typically late adopters of new trends, Huang said. Yet when consumers back a new trend, he said, it can really take off. The domestic market is big enough that startups based there need not expand abroad.</p>\r\n<p>“I think this time lag means foreigners are well placed to introduce new products and services to the Japanese market, if they can get the timing right,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Huang cautioned that Japanese language ability is required as no entrepreneurs will thrive there without it.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"http://www.infinityventures.com\" href=\"http://www.infinityventures.com/\">Infinity Ventures</a>, founded in 2009, looks mainly for content marketing startups. Candidates for funding also work with digital imaging, gaming and entertainment.</p>\r\n<h2>Thailand: Practice positive energy</h2>\r\n<p>Amarit Charoenphan, co-founder of Techsauce Media, a tech and business news outlet, and HUBBA, one of Thailand’s biggest co-working spaces, called the Southeast Asian country a “fun gateway” to burgeoning Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n<p>Thailand attracts startups largely for marketing and ecommerce.</p>\r\n<p>Charoenphan talked up Thailand’s those sectors and its draw for design companies. But the ambiguities common in Japan occur in Thailand, too, the co-founder said. A yes can even mean no, he said.</p>\r\n<p>It’s important to exchange “positive energy” between partners and investors and build trust, Charoenphan said.</p>\r\n<p>Charoenphan described Southeast Asia’s affordability and lifestyle as perfect for young entrepreneurs who need to keep burn rates low. Funding is available from the corporate venture capital sector in Thailand when startups want to expand.</p>\r\n<p>“While regulation in Thailand can be clunky,” Charoenphan said, “there is a willingness to make things smoother.”</p>\r\n<h2>Hong Kong as a link to China and a lot of other places</h2>\r\n<p>Hong Kong may draw startups for its ease of doing business, links to other parts of the world and entryway into mainland China, said Alex Chan, co-director of startup accelerator The Mills Fabrica. This firm, also a venture capital fund, focuses on startups that try new fashion production methods, e-commerce and high-tech fabrics.</p>\r\n<p>Hong Kong is otherwise known for business opportunities in financial technology and mini-storage.</p>\r\n<p>“From day one, Hong Kong has always been a bridging market,” Chan said. The territory’s position as a regional hub gives companies there better reach to markets and funding, he added.</p>\r\n<p>“Our strength comes from our connectivity across the region, so if we can recruit Taiwanese talent, it is to our benefit too,” said Chan, whose firm is based in Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<p>Against competition from other parts of Asia, Hong Kong may be able to gain an edge by expanding its textile industry – a former growth driver that has waned in recent years due to the outsourcing of manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>Today the sector employees almost 3 percent of the total labor force in Hong Kong and represents roughly 2 percent of exports. Chang says expanding innovation in e-commerce, fabric research and new production and distribution models can give the local sector new life.</p>\r\n<p>The Mills Fabrica looks for startups that try new fashion production methods, e-commerce and high-tech fabrics.</p>\r\n<p>Asked to share an insider tip, Chan said Hong Kong investors prefer companies that set up as a British Virgin Islands offshore corporation as the jurisdiction has virtually no taxation.</p>\r\n<h2>Taiwan &#8212; for entrepreneurs who want quality of life</h2>\r\n<p>Government support is giving Taiwan a lift as a cradle for startups, said Holly Harrington, co-founder and general manager of the Taiwan Startup Stadium.</p>\r\n<p>She talked up Taiwan’s tech-savvy talent and described what she calls quality of life. Many young Taiwanese have returned after years of working abroad, she said. But Taiwan-based startups must consider expanding offshore due to the markets small size, Harrington said.</p>\r\n<p>“Ultimately Taiwan is a bridging ecosystem,” she says. “So we encourage our members in Startup Stadium to focus on expanding outward.”</p>\r\n<p>Harrington points to a decrease in the number of startups active in China in recent years. More young firms are now looking toward the Japan, Southeast Asia and the United States, she said. Differences between the two sides in online platform usage and internet regulations explain the decrease, she said.</p>\r\n<p>The little-known Taiwanese founders behind some of Silicon Valley’s biggest startups give young entrepreneurs still in Taiwan extra access to funding and mentoring, Harrington said. Many VC firms, accelerators and consultants from other parts of the world feel good about Taiwan, she added.</p>\r\n<p>“When people hear you’re from Taiwan, they really want to help you,” she said.</p>\r\n<p>Startups based in Taiwan may need to adjust to the local stratospheric use of Facebook, she said. Harrington coaches young local entrepreneurs heading abroad to diversify their own social media usage.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan is seen as an ideal spot for internet-of-things startups.</p>\r\n<p>She also warns newcomers that Taiwanese may be late with e-mail replies and ignore missed phone calls. Taiwan’s process for getting entrepreneur visas could be improved, she said.</p>\r\n<p>“Once people discover the potential here, they keep coming back for more,” Harrington said.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42803</a></p>', './img/1070517-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

The 2018 event took place April 26-28 in Taipei and featured 20 speakers.</p>\r\n<p>Hsiung, 65, a former AU Optronics Corp. executive vice president who served a three-year prison term in the United States over an LCD price fixing case in 2012, spoke to a crowd of Taiwanese company executives, founders, investors and other industry specialists.</p>\r\n<p>The company will train its chatbots for business clients in specific fields, Hsiung said. It is working now on algorithms to let chatbots assist office managers, product managers and administrative staffs. D8AI will develop automated text-based virtual assistants, for example, to schedule meetings and travel.</p>\r\n<p>Hsiung gave few details in his speech about the role of artificial intelligence, saying that process is still being developed.</p>\r\n<h2>Founders both studied at the University of California, Berkeley</h2>\r\n<p>Hsiung founded D8AI in April 2017 with Richard Sheng, a University of California, Berkeley-educated computer scientist.</p>\r\n<p>“We wanted to explore the realm of AI applications,” Hsiung said. “We didn’t want to miss our opportunity to ride the AI wave.”</p>\r\n<p>Hsiung received a Ph.D. degree in physics from the same university. His was executive vice president of AU Optronics Corp. and a former CEO of Qisda Corp., both publicly traded high tech hardware companies in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>According to D8AI’s website, the company name derives from a longer term, Dimension-8 Artificial Intelligence. It set out to make customized software or software-hardware combinations for enterprises and other institutions work with their customers or employees.</p>\r\n<h2>Talent search</h2>\r\n<p>Pairing artificial intelligence, or AI, with startups will require more talent to come on board, Hsiung said.</p>\r\n<p>“I believe that Taiwan has AI talents,” Hsiung said. “We have cultivated many top engineering talents over the years. But many of them have joined big companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</p>\r\n<p>“I’d like to take this opportunity to encourage our Taiwanese young people to challenge yourself and try getting into AI,” he said.</p>\r\n<h2>E-commerce model</h2>\r\n<p>AI-powered chatbots now help e-commerce retailers and product managers. Today some of them greet customers in online stores, clarify customer needs and react to customer responses.</p>\r\n<p>In e-commerce now, chatbots sometimes serve as a final stroke of communication after an ecommerce transaction, according to this industry online magazine report.</p>\r\n<p>Chatbots can eventually help businesses automate sales and customer support services, in turn cutting labor costs, Hsiung said.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42867\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42867</a></p>', './img/1070514-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL);

Those investments have contributed about NT17.6 billion (US$604 million) to the Taiwan economy.</p>\r\n<p>“Despite Taiwan’s size, the possibilities here are endless… and the investment Google is making in Taiwan’s intelligent hardware isn’t restricted to smartphones alone,” said Chien Li-feng, Google Taiwan’s general manager at the launch.</p>\r\n<p>In January Google paid HTC to bring on 2,000 of the Taiwanese tech hardware firm’s employees and help develop Pixel smartphones.</p>\r\n<p>Following Google’s work in Taiwan to develop Android devices from Taiwan and Chromebook PCs, the company will expand its collaboration with its Taiwanese equipment contactors to develop vehicles, wearable devices, television sets and home appliances, Chien added.</p>\r\n<h2>Boom in artificial intelligence</h2>\r\n<p>Taiwan is becoming Google’s strategic base for AI hardware development.</p>\r\n<p>The 300 people being recruited for jobs in areas such as artificial intelligence will help Google Home, an interactive speaker, its Cloud services and consumer hardware.</p>\r\n<p>If Google wants to expand long term in Taiwan, the location needs not only a large scale of hardware, but also a foundation in software plus talents with core competence in artificial intelligence. That backdrop explains Google’s push for AI-related training courses in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>The training would support Google to expand fundamental AI knowhow, leading to higher adoption rates of its customizable machine learning service, the open-source dataflow programming library TensorFlow and other Google cloud-based tools.</p>\r\n<p>Training would help Taiwan’s universities and AI hardware manufacturers nurture AI talent on a larger scale, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Google will hold an “AI Innovation Research Camp” with academics at National Taiwan University, Ching Hua University, Chiao Tung University and Cheng-kung University. The camp would give academics more opportunities to deepen exchange with Google’s own AI experts and become better connected with the industry on an international level.</p>\r\n<p>Another training session, Google’s “Machine Learning Crash Course” will be free for university professors, high school teachers and company training managers. The idea is to spread AI education.</p>\r\n<p>“This learning material is not only made up of online courses, but also includes practical offline events,” Chien said.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42654\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42654</a></p>', './img/1070423-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

To get there, he says, the island government should pass a bill, issue guidelines or write a “playbook” on what’s legal, so businesses know what to do.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s still a wait-and-see approach,” Hsu told Business Next in an interview Tuesday. “The answers I got from the executive branch are a somewhat lenient approach, ‘I don’t encourage, but I don’t discourage.’ It’s kind of like a holding pattern.”</p>\r\n<p>Hsu said he has talked to Taiwan’s central bank and Financial Supervisory Commission, the two agencies that would formulate a crypto-policy, about learning from Asian peers such as Singapore and Japan.</p>\r\n<p>The minority Nationalist Party lawmaker is talking as well to peers in the majority Democratic Progressive Party caucus about some kind of legislation. Legislators have had several debates to date, he said, but they’re awaiting direction from the government before making any decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Cryptocurrency refers to freely traded digital tokens backed by a public transaction ledger, all outside a country’s formal monetary system. It can be used to buy and sell or to save as a financial asset like stocks or other currencies.</p>\r\n<p>Two Taiwan-based platforms and <a href=\"https://international.thenewslens.com/article/84475\">an estimated 25,000 local users</a> trade cryptocurrency as some major banks develop their own schemes. Fintech startups such as a Taiwanese <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42516\">“cold wallet” firm</a> are becoming more visible, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan needs cryptocurrency to stoke fintech, healthcare and developments in high tech, the lawmaker said.</p>\r\n<p>On March 23 parliament was scheduled to ask questions of Taiwan Premier William Lai about the government’s ambitions for cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission takes a “neutral” approach to cryptocurrency trade, a commission media liaison said this week. But the commission warned of “risks” in a statement on December 19 following price fluctuations in the crypto market.</p>\r\n<p>Officials worry now about cryptocurrency taxation and prevention of money laundering, Hsu said. Traditional banks that stand to lose business may also be pressuring government to shun liberalization, he said.</p>\r\n<p>China is prepping to tighten regulations that ban fundraisers called initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges, the state-run newspaper China Daily online said in February.</p>\r\n<p>Japan, by contrast, declared in April 2017 Bitcoin legal tender as part of efforts to become a major cryptocurrency trading center. Japan’s trade comes to <a title=\"http://www.cryptoanalyst.co/2017/10/13/japan-worlds-largest-bitcoin-trading/\" href=\"http://www.cryptoanalyst.co/2017/10/13/japan-worlds-largest-bitcoin-trading/\">58% of the global volume.</a></p>\r\n<p>“China banned it, so we could say ‘hey look we should do it,’” Hsu said.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/investments/consumer-alerts/virtual-currencies.aspx\" href=\"http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/investments/consumer-alerts/virtual-currencies.aspx\">Singapore</a> allows free trade in cryptocurrency and regulates cryptocurrency exchanges in case of laundering or funding for terrorists.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan probably lacks “momentum” to pass a cryptocurrency regulation at least in the first half of the year, Hsu says, but he believes guidelines are already in the works. People are already trading it, he notes.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s not so hard to regulate this,” he said. “You look at what Singapore is doing. Younger people want it and if our government fails to understand this, it’s a pity.”</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42579\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42579</a></p>', './img/1070323.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

To do this, the many outdated laws, regulations and interpretations implemented over the past few decades must be relaxed to allow Taiwan to reap even greater rewards in the international sphere.</p>\r\n<p>To retain excellent talent and deepen a culture of good corporate governance among local firms, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) was instructed by the premier to move quickly forward with revising the Securities and Exchange Act. In particular, amendments to extend the amount of time that companies can hold treasury shares for later distribution to employees should be drafted and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and debate as quickly as possible. A new blueprint for corporate governance should also be promoted. To encourage domestic and international firms to list on Taiwan’s stock exchanges, the FSC should take the initiative to organize relevant ministries and agencies to develop feasible measures that will increase momentum in the financial markets.</p>\r\n<p>Financial markets play an important role in supporting industrial development, said Premier Lai, as well as serve as a window onto the broader economy.

On the domestic front, in consideration of the nation’s overall development and industrial policies, accompanying strategies to draw foreign companies to Taiwan and retain professional talent should be developed. On the international front, a network among foreign chambers of commerce, domestic industry groups, overseas representative offices, central agencies and local governments should be built to improve overall efficiency.

Specifically, small experimental firms will be able to compete against well-knwon and big banks with little risk of violating normal laws including those covering intellectual property.</p>\r\n<p>Parliament finalized the fintech law in December. Both acts backed by Yu take effect this year.</p>\r\n<h2>One startup’s case</h2>\r\n<p>Yu’s Facebook chatbot has brought in the artificial intelligence firm <a title=\"https://www.sinitic.ai\" href=\"https://www.sinitic.ai/\">Sinitic</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Sinitic CEO, a Canadian entrepreneur, had applied for an entrepreneur visa to establish the startup in Taiwan, Yu said.

This approach is central to SMEs becoming more competitive through the adoption of smart technology applications and pursuit of innovation, he added.</p>\r\n<p>To this end, the premier directed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to continue providing multilevel guidance and present an action plan within one month. No time can be wasted in devising ways of effectively assisting in the transformation and upgrade of SMEs, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Lai made the remarks during a March 15 interagency meeting on accelerating investment. In addition to presentations on issues pertaining to SMEs, which comprise nearly 98 percent of businesses in Taiwan, participants were brought up to speed on progress relating to railway construction and maintenance key performance indicators as well as deregulation.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding railway KPIs, the premier said 38 specific plans are targeted for promotion under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program. Even as the government vigorously encourages railway construction, consideration is also given to matters like boosting domestic technological capabilities for operating networks, as well as developing the rail industry as a whole, he added.</p>\r\n<p>Running from September 2017 to August 2021, the NT$420 billion (US$14.4 billion) FIDP aims to meet Taiwan’s development needs for the next 30 years. It comprises eight categories: aquatic environments to build resilience against climate change, child care facilities to address declining birthrates, digitalization to create a connected nation, food safety to protect consumers’ health, green energy to ensure environmental sustainability, human resources to boost employment, railway development to provide convenient and safe transportation and urban-rural projects to balance regional development.</p>\r\n<p>According to Lai, keeping Taiwan’s rail industry moving forward is of paramount importance. The MOEA, Ministry of Transportation and Communications and Public Construction Commission will help achieve this goal by drafting policies covering the establishment of standards for related products, supply and demand, and promoting the broader participation of local firms in railway project tenders, he said.</p>\r\n<p>On the deregulation front, the premier said all reviews and reforms must be carried out with a view to boosting economic activity and meeting the needs of businesses and the public. Where appropriate, the regulatory framework should be relaxed to optimize the overall investment environment in Taiwan, he added.</p>\r\n<p>〔<strong>Original :Taiwan Today</strong>〕</p>', './img/computer-3246121_1280-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Taiwan Startup Stadium, Asia America Multi-Technology Association and Oath Taiwan co-organized the event.</p>\r\n<p>“Silicon Valley will be very strong for a long time to come,” Desmond said, referring to the cluster of California cities south of San Francisco, home to the likes of Apple and Intel.</p>\r\n<p>“One of the main reasons is you have a super high intensity of all the ingredients to be successful as a founder,” he said. “There are hundreds, if not thousands, of serial founders who act as mentors, early-stage investors, and there are hundreds and hundreds of venture sources for money.”</p>\r\n<p>About 80% of his audience came from tech startups, investment firms and other IT companies. Bernard Chan, founder of the Singaporean school for startups ALPHA Camp, moderated the discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Tech hotspots in other countries should also draw startup founders as they look for ways to raise funds and expand international markets, Desmond said. He named China, Israel, Berlin, London, Paris and Stockholm in particular.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, he said: “if you’re in security (software), you might not want to go to Silicon Valley but Tel Aviv, because a lot of investors who understand it are there.</p>\r\n<p>“What’s changing is not that Silicon Valley is getting weaker, it’s just that a lot of places around the globe are getting very strong,” Desmond said.</p>\r\n<h2>CrunchBase legacy</h2>\r\n<p>Desmond is also currently general manager of <a title=\"https://www.aol.com/video/channel/tech/\" href=\"https://www.aol.com/video/channel/tech/\">AOL Tech</a> and tech news media website <a title=\"https://www.engadget.com/uk/\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uk/\">Engadget.</a></p>\r\n<p>He was responsible for 11-year-old tech-company database CrunchBase from April 2012 to September 2015, when it spun off from AOL/Verizon as a standalone company. That role sparked discussion at the panel event.</p>\r\n<p>Desmond and colleagues turned CrunchBase’s former parent company TechCrunch into a source of news on tech startups after he reached the Silicon Valley in 1996. He had worked before as an Asia correspondent for <a title=\"http://time.com\" href=\"http://time.com/\">Time magazine.</a></p>\r\n<p>Asked at the event why relatively few Taiwanese startup list on CrunchBase, Desmond said that “perhaps it is evidence that critics say that the startup scene in Taiwan doesn&#8217;t think globally enough.”</p>\r\n<p>Approximately 3,000 Taiwanese startups are listed now on CrunchBase compared to Singapore’s 11,639 registered startups and Hong Kong’s 7,806. No fee is required for startup companies to be registered on CrunchBase.</p>\r\n<p>Desmond added that he often gets questions such as, “Why should we waste our time putting our data on CrunchBase?” and “Everybody in my neighborhood knows who I am, and all the investors (who) I know know who I am, so what&#8217;s the point?</p>\r\n<p>“The point is if you want to be seen by the global startups, if you want venture partners and investors around the world to know who you are, you have to be on CrunchBase,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>The speaker cautioned separately against funding for startups that do initial coin offerings (ICO), part of the crypto-currency phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p>“My personal opinion is that the ICO world has become very polluted. There are good ICOs, probably, but there&#8217;s awful lot of bad activity,” he said. “So people are becoming more careful about how to get involved in ICOs.</p>\r\n<p>“I think the crypto-apocalypse for TechCrunch would be that founders don&#8217;t want to get together with anybody anymore because they just raise money through ICOs,” Desmond added. “So you don&#8217;t have to meet investors. They stay working at their desk, publish their white paper, put up their website, sell their coins, raise a hundred and million dollars, and the inventors just disappear.”</p>\r\n<p>TechCrunch Disrupt is going to take place in Berlin and San Francisco this year, Desmond added in his remarks to the panel. The TechCrunch Disrupt team of 55 people organizes shows to give founders and investors a more efficient, productive way to find each other.</p>\r\n<p>“We will undoubtedly do an event in the future in Taipei. We also want to do a Disrupt outside of the States just in a handful of cities that have huge markets. For us, San Francisco is obviously a huge market,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Fellow Business Next Meet panelist Holly Harrington, general manager of <a title=\"https://www.startupstadium.tw\" href=\"https://www.startupstadium.tw/\">Taiwan Startup Stadium</a>, echoed some of Desmond’s advice for Taiwan startups. She runs a Taipei-based, government-funded incubator that aims to train Taiwanese startups for expansion overseas.</p>\r\n<p>The stadium has taken Taiwanese startups to San Francisco and New York for TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt events in the past years.</p>\r\n<p>Harrington suggested that Taiwanese founders look for other options as places to seek funds and expand markets such as the U.S. cities of Austin, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Founders will have a better chance to leverage resources in these cities as they emerge as innovation hubs in the United States, she said.</p>\r\n<p>“TSS started to spend a lot of time encouraging startups to explore other places in the U.S. because local governments all over the U.S. are putting more money into attracting startups,” Harrington said. “So if you want to go to Austin, Chicago, or Washington DC, it’s a little bit less competitive (compare to Silicon Valley).</p>\r\n<p>“Taiwanese startups (in Taiwan) are like a big fish in a small pond, so going to big cities in the U.S. helps them learn how to compete,” she said. “Silicon Valley is a good place to get a more realistic starting point for Taiwanese startups.”</p>\r\n<p>Foreign customers may not easily trust a brand when they can get similar products in their home countries, she said, so smaller Taiwanese companies must work harder to convince international markets that their brands top the competition.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s advantages in computer hardware manufacturing should not be ignored, said Ryan Kuo, president of <a title=\"http://www.cdibcapitalgroup.com/cdibenhtml/expertiseprint/1738\" href=\"http://www.cdibcapitalgroup.com/cdibenhtml/expertiseprint/1738\">CDIB Capital Innovation Accelerator</a> in Taipei. Local startup founders have the knowhow and capacity to build products that integrate software and hardware, he added.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese startups have a chance now to build on internet of things because of Taiwan’s strengths in ICT hardware, Kuo said. His accelerator gives startups ways to capitalize on the IoT trend and reach foreign markets, he added.</p>\r\n<p>〔<strong>Original :Meet Startup @TW</strong>〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42487</a></p>', './img/1070321-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

He encouraged businesses to continue partnering with the government in growing the economy and building an environment of peace and prosperity for all.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s economy grew nearly 2.6 percent in 2017, the premier said, outpacing growth from the year before. In December, the unemployment rate dropped to around 3.6 percent while imports and exports rose noticeably compared with the same period in previous years. And according to surveys by various job banks, nearly half the companies in Taiwan raised salaries following the government’s move to grant a 3-percent pay raise in the public sector.</p>\r\n<p>The government’s foremost agenda is to boost the economy, Premier Lai emphasized. When President Tsai Ing-wen took office, she advocated new economic policies for making Taiwan stronger. First, the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program will meet Taiwan’s infrastructure needs for the next generation. The expansion in government expenditures will spur private spending and further boost the economy.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the “five plus two” innovative industries policy brings seven designated industries under special Executive Yuan oversight in order to transform Taiwan’s economic structure.

(149, 'Taiwan courts foreign talent with Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals(Part 2)', '2018-01-25', 'news', '<h2>What does the Act do?</h2>\r\n<p>The main substance of the Act’s 22 Articles is as follows:<br />\r\nThe Act distinguishes between three categories of foreign professionals, namely “foreign senior professionals,” “foreign special professionals” and “foreign professionals,” with each receiving distinct benefits under separate provisions. Definitions of these three terms, and of what constitutes “professional work,” are set out in Article 4.</p>\r\n<p>Article 5 separates the work permit application process for school teachers from that for other foreign professionals, transferring administration from the Ministry of Labor to the Ministry of Education, with the aim of encouraging schools to expand their recruitment of foreign teachers.</p>\r\n<p>The Act broadens the range of subjects that foreign nationals can be employed to teach in short-term tutorial schools (so-called buxibans). Previously, such teaching was limited to foreign languages. Now, under Article 6, buxibans may, with due approval in each case, employ foreign nationals with specialized knowledge or skills to teach non-academic classes.</p>\r\n<p>Article 7 extends the duration of work permits for foreign special professionals from three to five years, and provides for the coterminous residence of their spouses and minor children. It also introduces a new provision that their adult children, if unable to live independently due to physical or mental disability, may reside continuously with them, rather than having to leave and reapply for a new visa every six months as before.</p>\r\n<p>Article 8 introduces the Employment Gold Card (EGC) for foreign senior professionals. Comparable to Singapore’s Personalized Employment Pass (PEP), these 4-in-1 cards combine work permit, resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) and re-entry permit.</p>\r\n<p>Article 9 confers a tax benefit on high-salaried foreign special professionals coming to work in Taiwan for the first time. For three years, only half of their salary above NT$3 million (approx. US$100,000) will be counted in the computation of their income tax liability.</p>\r\n<p>Article 10 provides for foreign artists to obtain freelance work permits of up to three years at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Article 11 brings foreign professionals under coverage of the Labor Pension Act’s retirement pension system.</p>\r\n<p>Article 12 brings foreign public school teachers under the same retirement regulations as apply to Taiwanese public school teachers. It means that they will now be entitled to opt for either a one-time lump-sum pension payment or a monthly pension, the latter of which was denied to them before.</p>\r\n<p>Article 13 allows foreign special professionals’ lineal ascendants (parents or grandparents) to stay with them in Taiwan for up to a year at a time, matching similar benefits conferred in Singapore.</p>\r\n<p>Article 14 addresses a previous cause of hardship by including the spouses, minor children, and adult disabled children of foreign professionals under coverage of National Health Insurance as soon as they have obtained documentary proof of residence, instead of having to wait six months for this benefit as before.</p>\r\n<p>Article 15 provides for foreign senior professionals and their spouses and dependent children to apply together for permanent residency.</p>\r\n<p>Article 16 makes more liberal provision for permanent-resident foreign professionals’ spouses and dependent children (both minor and disabled adult) to apply for permanent residency.</p>\r\n<p>Article 17 creates a new right for the adult non-citizen children of permanent-resident foreign professionals to apply for open work permits, provided they meet specified criteria for length of residence in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Article 18 greatly liberalizes the rules governing cancellation of permanent residence, allowing a permanent resident to stay away from Taiwan for up to five years at a time without risking loss of APRC.</p>\r\n<p>Article 19 introduces a new job-seeking visa, allowing foreign professionals to stay in or repeatedly visit Taiwan for up to six months for the purpose of seeking employment.</p>\r\n<p>Articles 20 and 21 respectively specify the Act’s application to residents of Hong Kong and Macau, and to citizens who come to work or seek work as holders of foreign passports. Article 22 empowers the Executive Yuan to decide when the Act comes into effect.</p>\r\n<h2>Will it make much difference?</h2>\r\n<p>Although not all foreign white-collar workers in Taiwan, whether already living and working there or intending to do so, will benefit from this new Act, there are many to whom it will deliver significant benefits. For some, those benefits might be very substantial, and could make all the difference as to whether or not they are willing to work and settle in Taiwan. Together with other measures to build a more business-friendly and more internationalized environment, including initiatives to enhance the provision of English information, signage and services, they should prove to be an important part of enabling Taiwan to compete with the likes of Singapore in attracting the international talent that it essentially needs for realizing the fullest potential of its economic development.</p>\r\n<p>University teachers are among the foremost beneficiaries of the Act, gaining the much improved pension rights that have long pleaded for. In conjunction with the amendment of the Nationality Act that opens the door for foreign professors to obtain ROC citizenship without having to renounce their original nationality, and with the Yushan Project under which the government will subsidize higher remuneration for elite foreign and local professors, it should substantially help universities to recruit and retain high-quality foreign academic staff.</p>\r\n<p>Many of Taiwan’s foreign residents and frequent visitors rhapsodize about their affection for the island, preferring it to anywhere else in East Asia, or even anywhere in the whole world. Taiwan’s gorgeous natural beauty, rich scope for outdoor activities, kind and friendly people, vibrant culture, free and open society, and many other attributes, appeal to them deeply. It’s common to hear long-term residents tell how they came to study Chinese, or for a short work assignment, or just stopping by on a swing through Asia, never intending a protracted stay, but liked it so much that they’ve stayed and stayed, and no long expect to ever leave.</p>\r\n<p>But on the negative side, they chafe at being constantly restricted and thwarted by illiberal laws and regulations, excluded from sharing the rights and benefits enjoyed by local citizens, yet denied a fair path to becoming citizens by naturalization. In the end, many decide they have to leave. More favourable job conditions beckon them to other parts of Asia – Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and the fast developing economies of Southeast Asia in particular – or back to North America, Europe, or wherever they were born and grew up. Those countries gain, Taiwan loses. And usually, their departure is a double loss to Taiwan, for it loses not only the human capital of these well educated, highly skilled and resourceful people, but also loses their family members – bilingual, bicultural children who could be treasures of the future for Taiwan if they stayed.</p>\r\n<p>If this Act makes enough of a difference to persuade at least some of such people to stay in Taiwan, under better conditions for building careers and leading full lives, as well as luring a good many more to come and join them, then it will deliver an ample return for its making. Whether or not it does achieve as much as might be hoped for, it certainly does mark a major shift in a positive direction.</p>\r\n<h2>Thumbs up for the Act!</h2>\r\n<p><a title=\"Forward Taiwan\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42015\">Forward Taiwan</a><a title=\"Forward Taiwan\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42015\">,</a>a group at the forefront of advocacy for immigration reform, has hailed the Act’s passage while warning against the danger of backtracking through the insertion of limitations in subsidiary regulations and letters of interpretation. But provided these are drawn up fully in accordance with the spirit and intention of the Act, the result should be a much improved environment and freer opportunity for high-skilled foreign workers in Taiwan.<br />\r\nThere is, without doubt, a great deal in the Act for those covered by it to be pleased about. As expressed by Michael Fahey, a long-resident legal consultant who has been closely involved in pressing the case for more liberal treatment of foreign residents and their families: “We are in a celebratory mood – this is the most important development for the international community since the advent of permanent residence at the turn of the century.”</p>\r\n<p>〔<strong>Original :Meet Startup @TW</strong>〕</p>', './img/1070122-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),
(150, 'Taiwan courts foreign talent with Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals(Part 1)', '2018-01-22', 'news', '<p>With the recent passage of the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals, conditions for attracting high-ability international talent to live and work in Taiwan have been broadly and substantively improved.</p>\r\n<h2>Why the need?</h2>\r\n<p>The Act was drafted by the National Development Council (NDC) to address the pressing need for more effectively attracting and retaining international talent, to fill growing shortages in Taiwan’s domestic talent pool. As the NDC explained, “In this era of the globalized knowledge economy, sufficiency and quality of talent is a core factor in international competitiveness. Taiwan is currently facing the challenges of an exodus of talent and fierce competition among countries to attract talent. Hence, this law is drawn up to enhance Taiwan’s recruitment and employment of foreign talent, and thus raise its ability to compete internationally.”</p>\r\n<p>Even without the exodus of talent referred to by the NDC, Taiwan was already facing a talent shortage in many key areas. This stems largely from demographic causes, as Taiwan’s very low birth rate – one of the world’s lowest – has caused the working age population to shrink steadily year by year.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a serious brain drain is exacerbating this situation, as large numbers of Taiwan’s best and brightest are lured abroad by higher pay and better career prospects in China and elsewhere. The OECD has assessed Taiwan as having the world’s most serious total emigrant brain drain, while the UK economic research institution Oxford Economics has forecast that by 2021 Taiwan will have the most acute brain drain of any country in the world.</p>\r\n<p>These circumstances pose a massive threat to Taiwan’s future economic development, and make it absolutely essential for Taiwan to lure in more of the personnel it needs to fill these deficiencies of technical, managerial, and other vital kinds of high-skilled talent in its work force.</p>\r\n<p>According to a survey by international human resources firm Manpower Group, released in November 2016, 73 percent of 1,005 employers polled in Taiwan said that finding talent was difficult. This figure, the second worst among the 43 countries and regions surveyed, was up by 16 percentage points from the corresponding survey of a year earlier, underlining how fast the situation is going from bad to worse.</p>\r\n<p>These shortages evidently cannot be rectified, at least in the near term, only by measures to improve the supply and retention of local talent. Such measures are important, but cannot be enough on their own. Therefore, the only other way to respond to them is by measures to promote an increased inflow of foreign talent.</p>\r\n<p>However, businesses – both local and foreign – have long complained about the difficulties of recruiting key international talent to meet staffing needs that they cannot fill through local recruitment. This has been impeded by a host of regulatory barriers restricting the residence and employment of foreign nationals. On top of this, foreign professionals who do take up residence and employment in Taiwan have found their lives and careers so limited by hard-to-endure regulatory constraints that many elect to move away to countries where they can expect to enjoy more favourable treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Against this background, it is only too clear that Taiwan’s government needs to be doing as much as it possibly can to attract high-skilled personnel from around the world.</p>\r\n<h2>Who does Taiwan need?</h2>\r\n<p>High-skilled white-collar personnel needed to fill managerial, technical, marketing and other positions in local or foreign-invested industrial and commercial enterprises are by no means the only kind of foreign talent that Taiwan needs to attract. Its universities are in dire need of attracting more high-quality teaching staff to enhance their internationalization and reverse their falling trend in international rankings. This need, again, has been made all the more urgent by a sharp exodus of academic staff poached by universities on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time that its universities need help in attracting more international faculty, they also need help in attracting more international students. With the depressed birth rate resulting in steeply falling enrolment in higher education, many universities and university departments are struggling to attract even the bare minimum of students that they need for their very survival. Being better able to attract foreign students will not only provide a means of overcoming this difficulty, but will also supply a promising source of future talent for all parts of the economy.</p>\r\n<p>As advanced economies have long understood and taken full advantage of, attracting foreign students pays great dividends over time if at least some of them stay to work after they graduate. Having become at least partly acculturated, and most likely having acquired at least some proficiency in local languages, they will be able to adapt to the local work environment and integrate into the local society much better than people recruited at a later stage of their lives. If, as will often be the case, they form families and settle permanently, the host economy and society will gain yet more.</p>\r\n<p>That is why countries such as Germany and Norway seek to attract foreign students with free-tuition policies, which they know will pay them back many times over with ensuing gains to their work force and population. Such benefit is truly invaluable in today’s advanced economies, especially for an aging and soon-to-be hyper-aging society that pressingly needs a transfusion of young blood to offset its worsening demographic imbalance.</p>\r\n<p>Another segment of foreign talent that Taiwan needs to set out its stall to attract is entrepreneurs, especially young entrepreneurs with innovative ideas for business startups that match the government’s ambitious plans for connecting Taiwan to global tech clusters and creating new industries for the next generation, as embodied in the Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan launched in September 2016. While Taiwanese themselves have plenty of the skills, vision and know-how for achieving these goals, an increased inflow of foreign talent to augment the talent supply can only enhance the startup and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The multi-faceted value they bring, for strengthening international linkages, broadening target horizons, and opening up optimal opportunities for global marketing success, can hardly be overstated.</p>\r\n<p>So the needs for attracting well qualified and able foreign nationals to Taiwan is clear enough. But other countries, including Taiwan’s main economic rivals, also have a similar need, and have previously responded to it more proactively than Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>While the competition to attract the cream of the international work force has continued to intensify, Taiwan has lagged well behind others in luring such people to its shores and keeping them when they do come. The numbers attest to this all too starkly. According to figures released by the Ministry of Labor, there were fewer than 32,000 foreign white-collar professionals working in Taiwan as of the end of March this year. Well over a quarter were Japanese, roughly one-sixth were American, and a little over one thousand each were from Canada and the UK. Almost a quarter of those with work permits were teachers, while just one in eight, or less than 4,000, were employed in providing professional, scientific and technical services.</p>\r\n<p>Contrast this with Singapore where, according to figures released by the Ministry of Manpower, as of June 2017, there were 189,900 foreign nationals working under the Employment Pass for foreign professionals, managers and executives, plus 179,400 with the S Pass for mid-level skilled staff – a total of 369,300 white-collar foreign workers versus Taiwan’s 32,000, or more than eleven times as many, despite Singapore having a resident population (citizens and permanent residents) of under 4 million versus Taiwan’s resident population of more than 23 million.</p>\r\n<p>This, then, is the background against which the NDC mapped out the provisions of the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals.</p>\r\n<h2>How did the Act get made?</h2>\r\n<p>Having well appreciated the need for across-the-board revision of laws and regulations to create more open and welcoming conditions for foreign professionals to live and work in Taiwan, the NDC set the ball rolling in October 2016 by mapping out a set of proposals for liberalizations relating to visas, residence, insurance, naturalization, retirement and other pertinent matters, to make Taiwan’s work environment friendlier and thereby encourage foreign talent to come to Taiwan and stay here. In mapping these out, it consulted the views and suggestions of foreign chambers of commerce and other representatives of the expatriate community, and considered what measures advanced and competitor countries such as the U.S., UK, Japan, Korea and Singapore had taken to achieve similar purposes.</p>\r\n<p>Since the wide ambit of the proposed legislation involved the jurisdiction of many different departments of government, the NDC needed to conduct extensive coordination with the authorities concerned to finalize the terms of the draft Act.</p>\r\n<p>After the draft was completed and had been approved by the Premier and President, it was posted on the Online Public Policy Participation Platform for the requisite period of public notice and comment, and was submitted to the Legislative Yuan in late April 2017.</p>\r\n<p>While the first draft of the Act included provision by which select foreign nationals might have a chance of gaining ROC nationality without having to renounce any other citizenship, narrowly conferring as a privilege what foreign residents have long argued ought to be liberally granted as a right, this was instead provided for by amendment of the Nationality Act, and therefore removed from the final draft.</p>\r\n<p>Although the draft Act received strong cross-partisan support in the legislature, some voices were raised against it, expressing exaggerated fears of foreigners pouring in to displace local people from jobs. Fortunately, such short-sighted, blinkered and ill-considered arguments did not prevail. But objections were successful against provisions that would have allowed foreign university students or graduates out of school less than two years to come to Taiwan for internships of up to two years. In light of assertions that this could be abused by businesses as a means of taking in low-paid foreign interns to replace higher salaried local employees, these provisions were excised. But apart from this, the other provisions of the draft were endorsed with only relatively small modifications, and <a title=\"it passed its third reading in the legislature\" href=\"https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=4061A3F0B105B5AE&amp;s=E96CA8D98401E172\">it passed its third reading in the legislature</a> on October 30, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>One of the strongest advocates of the law during the enactment process was legislator Karen Yu (余宛如). As Yu explained in an <a title=\"interview\" href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/41840\">interview</a> for BusinessNext, the main purpose of the Act was to help local industries, especially those enterprises with their sights set on going global. She emphasized that “every single industry would benefit from foreign talent,” and citing her own experience as an entrepreneur, suggested that foreign talent is often a crucial ingredient for success.</p>\r\n<p>While this Act has already been added to Taiwan’s statute law, much work remains to be done before it can be put into effect. Many sets of subsidiary regulations and letters of interpretation must be drafted by the various agencies concerned. For example, regulations for teachers must be set by the Ministry of Education, regulations on the issuance of Employment Gold Cards must be set by the Ministry of the Interior in consultation with the Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and regulations on artist work permits must be set by the Ministry of Labor in consultation with the Ministry of Culture. The NDC is actively coordinating the completion of all subsidiary measures, and expects all to be ready for the Act to go into effect before the Chinese New Year in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>〔<strong>Original :Meet Startup @TW</strong>〕</p>', './img/1070122-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Industrialization, robots, and artificial intelligence are the fad now and will continue to stay and grow. Yet, the heart will always yearn for a human touch.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Technology is a tool to improve your operations; the human element is what makes MSMEs unique and long-lasting. Treat your employees with dignity and respect and engage your customers with the warmth of a human smile. Humane entrepreneurship is all encompassing.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 4 TREND :PERSONALIZATION IS THE NEW HOT TOPIC FOR MSMEs<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs can no longer compete on price or convenience of location as big businesses have discovered how to deliver their products to their clients on the same day and at a lower price. Given their size, big businesses have developed one-size fits all for many products for mass consumption. MSMEs cannot compete at this level.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should brainstorm and develop products and services that are personalized for their costumer needs and preferences. The benefits of new technologies like 3D printing and being close to the consumer will allow MSMEs to offer them a new and more attractive option.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 3 TREND :ATTRACTING A NEW WORKFORCE FOR SMEs<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> SMEs should jump on the opportunity to hire millennials by offering them the stability of a quality job, but with the benefits of innovation, encouraging creativity, and opportunity to grow. As millennials are the workforce of the future, they will be able to offer the best skillset, mindset, and productivity to SMEs. Its HIP to work for an SME!<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> SMEs should identify ways to engage millennials and think about how to offer compelling jobs to attract them. The jobs need to be better than what are offered in the GIG economy and more innovative than the strict corporate environment.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 2 TREND :ACCESS TO FINANCE AND NEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs and entrepreneurs will have more options available than ever before to finance their companies. Many banks will launch new financial products aimed at micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, new mediums such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd funding, invoice-factoring, and corporate finance are expected to increase rapidly. Economists also anticipate that new and much unregulated financing options will appear via crypto-currencies.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should begin exploring these new financing options, but understand the inherit risks of each.</p>\r\n<p>ICSB NUMBER ONE TREND FOR 2018 :MSMEs PROTECTING THEIR ASSETS<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> The value of MSMEs lies in their assets. The assets can range from the customer base and know-how, to location, business service, and reputation. These unique assets need to be protected now more than ever before because more threats are coming that no one has ever experienced.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Protect your core assets!

ICSB polled its global experts to help identify the 2018 Top Ten Trends for MSMES. ICSB predicts that 2018 will be a very positive year for the majority of MSMEs and with a higher level increase of support from governments. These Top Ten Trends below is a list of what MSMEs need to prepare for and utilize in their businesses.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 10 TREND : MSMEs TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs are the fabric of communities, reaching many sustainable development goals without realizing it. Yet, they can be empowered to do more. MSMEs can become the measuring stick of how we are achieving SDGs.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should make the SDGs a prominent feature to demonstrate why consumers should buy from them to further support the SDGs. If a consumer sees an MSME engaged in the SDGs, they will further support it. Like buying organic or recycling, MSMEs should allow consumers to contribute to a sustainable world.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 9 TREND: SMEs: DOING GOOD AND DOING WELL CAN CO-EXIST!<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> This is also known as social entrepreneurship. Yet, why give it a label if this can be the norm? MSMEs should have social entrepreneurship as a standard operating procedure and not a diversion from their core business strategy.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Educators, policy-makers, and consultants should educate, encourage, and assist MSMEs to develop the framework for this new operating model.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 8 TREND: A GROWING ECONOMY REQUIRES A FORMAL ECONOMY<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> Bringing businesses from the informal to the formal economy must occur through incentives, not threats. The best way to attract MSMEs is through direct benefits, such as loans, government contracts, and access to the global marketplace.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Governments need to propose a set of clear and enticing incentives to encourage informal companies to switch. Until then, it is a missed opportunity for both parties.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 7 TREND: GROWTH IS EASIER THAN EVER FOR MSMEs<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs now have the opportunity to expand their reach and influence through more mediums than ever before. If you have a website, you are a global _rm. If you accept online payments, you can export. The impediments to grow are shrinking every day. However, competition and the ability to build a successful strategy is increasing daily.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Plan to grow your business through smart strategies that leverage today’s technology and ease of doing business. If you do not have a plan, someone else will steal your customers.</p>\r\n<p>NUMBER 6 TREND: MSMEs TO ADJUST FOR DISRUPTION<br />\r\n<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> Unforeseen events will happen; how MSMEs adjust to them will determine their long-term survival and effectiveness. SMEs must plan to handle unexpected disruptions more quickly and creatively. A contingency plan is no longer optional.<br />\r\n<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should build contingency plans to accommodate major temporary disruptions in to their operations.

Premier Lai expressed hope that the spirit and success of these award-winning businesses can stand as a source of learning and encouragement for other SMEs in the pursuit of ever more robust growth.</p>\r\n<p>Seeing the challenges facing economic development in Taiwan following her inauguration, President Tsai Ing-wen chose to tackle the issue on three fronts, said the premier. First, on the industrial front, the president pledged support for ongoing improvements in techniques and technology among the nation’s businesses, and put forward the “five plus two” innovative industries plan to spur the next generation of industrial development. Second, with respect to expanding government spending, the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program was proposed as a conduit for increased public spending aimed at encouraging greater investment by the private sector.</p>\r\n<p>Third, on the trade policy front, the government is promoting the New Southbound Policy. Taiwan’s economy has continued to grow for the past 20 years thanks in part to westward business expansion into mainland China. However, as costs associated with land, labor, environmental protection and capital acquisition in mainland China have continued to rise, the government introduced the New Southbound Policy to assist in the continued development of Taiwan’s business community.</p>\r\n<p>Acknowledging the universal expectation that the government pursue economic growth as a primary duty, Premier Lai said that the Executive Yuan is actively promoting six concrete policies to boost Taiwan’s economy. The first is a 3 percent pay raise for public employees. Second, the government is knocking down barriers to investment in Taiwan. The third is reform of the nation’s tax system, while the fourth is active pursuit of deregulation. The fifth and sixth policies are the implementation of President Tsai’s Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program and the “five plus two” innovative industries plan.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the Ministry of Labor has already posted draft amendments to the Labor Standards Act that would change the current requirement of one mandatory day off per week together with one flexible day off, and is now accepting public comments for one week. The Executive Yuan will then make a final decision, and expects to send the revisions to the Legislative Yuan for review before the middle of November.

The premier made the remarks after a briefing by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on its use of the credit guarantee support mechanism for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and innovative startups.</p>\r\n<p>The Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan has been effective in helping SMEs access business financing, and should continue to do so, the premier said. He instructed the MOEA and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to encourage the Bankers Association of the Republic of China and the nation’s financial institutions to extend more assistance and strategic support to SMEs as well as new types of businesses such as youth-driven startups and social enterprises.</p>\r\n<p>The MOEA and FSC should also work closely on expanding a forward-looking SME financing service platform to promote the development of financial technology, mobile payments and business innovation. Through these efforts, the credit guarantee mechanism will fulfill the objectives of helping new businesses and supporting innovation, Premier Lai said.</p>\r\n<p>According to the MOEA, Taiwan’s 1.4 million-plus SMEs account for 97.22 percent of all firms in the country, forming the bedrock of Taiwan’s economic security. The government has therefore made it a priority to help SMEs access the funds needed to grow. Since the SME Credit Guarantee Fund came under the remit of the MOEA in 2003, it has been instrumental in assisting businesses that lack sufficient loan collateral.

The first is market deregulation. The Executive Yuan has already sent a bill on financial technology innovation to the Legislative Yuan, where it will hopefully be approved quickly. The Executive Yuan is also considering easing restrictions in the Company Act so that social enterprises can maintain their overall direction and integrity, whether their investments come from financial companies, large corporations, or small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>\r\n<p>The second commitment is to direct the Executive Yuan’s subordinate agencies to support the lab’s efforts moving forward.

The IDIPC is well known for developing green energy and environmental protection. Together, the SMEA and the IDIPC are organizing the 2017 SME Business Day for Tainan, with the theme &#8220;Circular Economy: Creating New Business Opportunities for Green Energy&#8221;. In attendance were SMEA Deputy Director General Su Wen-Ling; Tainan City Deputy Mayor Wu Tsung-Jung; Tainan City IDIPC Deputy Director General Wang Shih-Hao; Tainan City SME Honorary Instructors Association Chairman Huang Shun-Tse; Industrial Technology Research Institute Commercialization and Industry Service Center Deputy Director Huang Hsin-Chien; and Corporate Synergy Development Center President Chu Hsing-Hua. They were there to witness the innovation and creative capabilities of SMEs in developing Taiwan&#8217;s circular economy.</p>\r\n<p>SMEA Deputy Director General Su Wen-Ling noted that discussions on sustainability in the past have mainly focused on how to reduce the damage caused to the environment by industrial development. Current discussions on the circular economy not only focus on being environmentally friendly and reducing waste, but also on designing technologies, processes, and products that are based on concepts of circulation and renewal, in order to create a positive effect on the natural environment and economic activities. Su Wen-Ling pointed out that Taiwan relies on imports for over 90% of its energy and resources, and over 60% of its food. We must therefore consider how to help resources continually circulate and be reused. The circular economy, a topic of future sustainability, is set to become the main direction for innovative economic models and market demand creation, not only in Taiwan, but around the world. Now is the time for Taiwanese enterprises that excel in R&amp;D and innovation to show what they&#8217;re capable of and gain a foothold in the international market!</p>\r\n<p>Tainan City is striving to become a low carbon metropolis. Deputy Mayor Wu Tsung-Jung said that Tainan has supported the Executive Yuan in building Shalun Green Energy Science City, developing Taiwan Energy Decision Center, and establishing a more complete green energy ecosystem and industrial chain. In addition, the city government is also actively working with non-governmental organizations to encourage the industrial sector to reconsider its material sourcing, product design, production, use, and recycling. Wu Tsung-Jung emphasized his expectations that the future industrial development of Tainan City will be aligned with the circular economy. He also welcomed enterprises with the same vision to come to Tainan, so they can jointly create the limitless business opportunities of the circular economy!</p>\r\n<p>Wang Shih-Hao, Deputy Director General of the Tainan City IDIPC, pointed out that the Committee is exerting every effort in the SME Business Day Activity Series of the MOEA. This is under Mayor Lai Ching-Te&#8217;s policy of assisting SMEs, and specifically helping the SMEs of Tainan City to expand into new markets and new business opportunities, and promoting the mutual prosperity and collaboration of domestic enterprises. The Committee is actively building a platform for business opportunity exchanges between SMEs. This will assist enterprises in technology, products, capital, management, marketing, and distribution channels. The Committee will strive to hold the event in Tainan City every year in the future, in hopes of creating more business opportunities and becoming a flagship of Tainan City&#8217;s urban development.</p>\r\n<p><b>Investing in Circular Economy with Creativity and Macro Perspective, SMEs Compete for Sustainable Business Opportunities</b></p>\r\n<p>This event combined the resources of industry, government, academia, and research institutes in southern Taiwan. A total of 22 enterprises and 3 science and technology universities, all involved in renewable energy, green lighting, energy conservation and environmental protection, and green transportation, were invited. Numerous company representatives arrived to experience the nearly 30 innovative technologies and green energy applications, and also engaged in lively interactions.</p>\r\n<p>One of the goals of renewable energy has always been to lower the threshold for power generation and to utilize even more natural resources. Target Solar Company and Green Energy Technology Inc. jointly showed off their lightweight, portable, even bendable solar panels. These will allow solar power to more easily become a part of daily life. True Ten Industrial Company has developed a mobile hydroelectric generator. Zhen Xin Technology Company&#8217;s run-of-the-river micro-hydroelectric power generation system can successfully use the kinetic energy of smaller water currents for power generation, increasing the scope of application for power generation systems. These technologies made the renewable energy exhibit quite eye-catching. The five enterprises in the green lighting area were focused on vision care and design requirements for various lighting situations. They were introducing green lighting material solutions with different materials and functional characteristics, making them the absolute center of attention.</p>\r\n<p>The energy conservation and environmental protection area, which had the most exhibitors this time, displayed the abundant results of SMEs&#8217; pursuit of environmental sustainability over the past few years. TecHome Technology Company is the first spin-off of National Cheng Kung University. The company surprised the industry by transforming reservoir sludge, so troubling to water resource departments for the past several decades, into popular materials for interior design and decoration companies. Insheng Engineering Company, the only production process company in the world to independently develop production equipment, modules, and unique designs, has developed an energy efficient, high power chemical plastic pump that has impressed even the major European companies. The electric compression garbage truck of Dokin Motors Company, the electric logistics equipment of Noveltek, and the energy and transportation solution of Digi-Triumph Technology Inc. for green logistics parks were displayed in the green transportation area. These provided more efficient application systems for the constant evolution of Industry 4.0. The 3 key science and technology universities in Southern Taiwan, namely Kun Shan University, Far East University, and Chia Nan University of Pharmacy &amp; Science, also showed off numerous environmental, energy efficient, and innovative products, giving the green ideas of college students good exposure.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan&#8217;s SMEs are overflowing with innovative energy, and have always been the key to driving Taiwan&#8217;s economic development. The SMEA selects different themes for business events based on industrial trends each year. This gives enterprises the opportunity to work together in technology, marketing, and capital, and also to gain exposure in the media. Over the years, these business events have created business opportunities worth billions of NTD.

Meanwhile, businesses that want to remain in Taiwan must learn to lower costs and increase production value to meet those challenges. Confident that Taiwanese enterprises can lower production costs, the premier said it is the government’s responsibility to help them increase their industrial value-added.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwan’s future growth hinges on investment, and right now, the nation’s poorer-than-expected economic performance is a clear sign that investment is lacking, the premier said. But to enhance industrial competitiveness, investment must be directed toward innovation and job creation.</p>\r\n<p>The government has made “innovation, employment and equitable distribution” the keynotes of its economic policy, with equitable distribution as the foundation of social stability. Without that foundation, the premier said, there can be no social stability, while enterprise owners that share profits with their employees can attract better talent and create a virtuous cycle of growth.</p>\r\n<p>The government, Lin said, is responsible for creating the basic conditions for a healthy investment environment. Noting public concern about electricity supplies, the premier underscored the administration’s efforts to reform Taiwan’s energy structure and develop renewable energy resources. These efforts include managing peak-load demand, promoting energy conservation and the further diversification of energy sources to ensure that energy demand is met during the transition process.</p>\r\n<p>Looking ahead, the government will promote solar and wind power projects, adopt smart grids and time-of-use pricing strategies, and reduce energy demand during peak hours. This will not only ease Taiwan’s energy problems, but also create investment opportunities in the renewable energy sector, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The premier also mentioned the “five plus two” innovative industries policy, which focuses on integrating and investing in existing and new industries. The Asian Silicon Valley plan, for instance, aims to combine Industry 4.0 concepts with computers, smart enterprises, and information and communications technology to make Taiwan globally competitive in smart cities, smart transportation, internet of things technology, and e-finance. Another example is the policy to develop intelligent machinery, which aims to upgrade the machinery industry and integrate industrial, academic and research resources to stay competitive with European and Japanese peers, and keep the industry abreast of the latest developments.</p>\r\n<p>Through the New Southbound Policy, Lin said, the government is also building closer ties with Southeast and South Asian countries to pursue free trade and investment protection agreements, enhance exchanges and cooperation, and create strategic alliances for mutual benefit. He added that under this policy, Taiwanese companies will enjoy greater protection when operating or investing abroad.</p>\r\n<p>In closing, the premier touted small and medium-sized enterprises as the heart of Taiwan’s innovation and job growth. These small but nimble businesses represent Taiwan’s greatest strength due to their capacity for innovation, diversity, and adaptability. Those strengths create many new development opportunities, so the government will facilitate continued growth by helping them overcome obstacles and developing new recruitment channels.</p>', './img/1051028SME-1000x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Another thing is <a href=\"http://www.angel.co/\">AngelList</a>, kind of like facebook for start-ups where you can write introduction to your group and investors to contact you more easily there.</p>\r\n<p>It is important for start-ups to build a “angel investor portfolio.” The key difference between a good and a bad angel is their emotion management (Everybody laughed). You should go look for feedback from companies that have received their funding after 1 or two years.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How did you deal with the valuation?</strong></p>\r\n<p>John: We asked our neighbor in the accelerator and reported similar amount, which was 3 million at the first time.  I don’t think valuation is that important for start-ups. Dropbox didn’t do well on that at first either.</p>\r\n<p>Ben: Usually, I would first like to know what problems this start-up is trying to solve. Every problem is an opportunity, so is this problem big enough? Secondly, I would like to know whether this group is suitable for doing the things they want. We spend time getting to know “people”, like the CTO and CEO of the company.</p>\r\n<p>For some people, I will give them money even after they fail at the tenth time. I want to be part of their future success.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding valuation, especially in seed round, there is really no reference. The only thing that matters is whether there’s investor willing to give the amount you want. By the way, investors who are willing to pay much may not be the best choice. It may be because they don’t understand what you are doing exactly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What are the next steps after getting the funding?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brad: We moved to a new office, not for “enjoying the money”. Before we got the funding, our group of 11 people worked in a very small and “cozy” place, we needed a better working environment and to start recruiting. Besides this, we spent most money on recruitment. Deepblu sells high-end products, we need the best employees who are stress resistant and able to design the best products. So, we spent time and money advertising and head-hunting abroad. It depends on companies. To us, employees matter.</p>\r\n<p>John: Like what I just mentioned, the first investor for CardinalBlue was a VC firm from the Silicon Valley who wanted us to expand. So we hired a very expensive BD and spent a lot of money on PR. They even suggested us to buy users. In this process, we discovered that we can do BD, PR ourselves. I think they are great investors. They wanted CardinalBlue to become what they wanted it to be. But we have our own way to go, so do most start-ups.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Are there problems that cannot be solved with money?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brad: Without money, nothing is possible. With money, not everything is possible. Money is no guarantee for living happily ever after. Money can’t help us on the relationship with the board of directors, or avoid to stop our collaboration with one co-founder because of the plan for the future started to differ.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, employees can be another source of pain. I think people is really the key. Especially early employees influence the culture of the organization. My advice is to look for people slowly and fire people rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>John: You cannot buy the feeling of being poor with money. When you have 2 million dollars in the bank account, it is hard to run as fast as if you are running out of money. Thus, it is very important to remind yourself the feeling when you had nothing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How should investors interact with start-ups?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ben: I think it’s better to be themselves. One can never fake long. Of course we like good news. But please don’t forget we need bad news as well, in the first place. If we don’t know what happened, how can we help? Maybe I happened to know a software guy who can solve your problem in 15 minutes through telephone. Investors usually know more people than you do. But you have to let them know your need. Also, please provide us possible solutions when telling us your problem. You should take your time and come up with a plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How should we schedule fundraising plans?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ben: We do have some general principles regarding this WHEN question. According to our experience, there’s a 6-month interval between the day you start fundraising and the day you receive the money. For early start-up, it will be better to use this money to survive the first 2 years.</p>\r\n<p>Brad: There’s a kind of girl in school who always says she doesn’t want a boyfriend because she wants to focus on schoolwork. After a while, she goes out with another guy. I think start-ups can learn from this story when facing VCs.  You can act as if you don’t need them. However, this is only feasible when you have some money to survive at the time. If this is the case, you can stay open to any possible investors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', './img/business-561387_1280-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL);

(172, 'Now you get your funding. What’s next?(PART I)', '2016-08-04', 'news', '<p>Money is often the biggest problem that a startup would face from the very beginning. Countless projects die in the process of fundraising. Because of this, many entrepreneurs share their experiences about getting venture capital, investors and pitching in business forums. However, are you curious about the next step? Shall we use the money to hire sales person or engineers? What are some problems that cannot be solved with money?</p>\r\n<p>This time in School for Entrepreneur Forum, guest speakers talk about the “next steps” after getting the capitals. We are pleased to invite Brad, co-founder of Deepblu, John, co-founder of CardinalBlue and Ben, co-founder of the Taiwanese venture capital firm Mesh Ventures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Deepblu: communication, goal and control</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brad Chen is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://deepblu.com/\">Deepblu</a>, a startup providing diving log and social network service that sells also their diving smart watch. They just receive seed funding last year in 2015. Before Deepblu, Brad worked in the semiconductor and IT industry for 12 years. But he never forget his passion for diving.</p>\r\n<p>Brad Chen is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://deepblu.com/\">Deepblu</a>, a startup providing diving log and social network service that sells also their diving smart watch. They just receive seed funding last year in 2015. Before Deepblu, Brad worked in the semiconductor and IT industry for 12 years. But he never forget his passion for diving.</p>\r\n<p>“Deepblu was founded in 2013, providing diving product and service. We aimed to build a service emphasizing the social aspect of this sport, which is based on sharing people’s experience. Last month, we released Deepblu in Singapore. Our goal is to become a international company.”</p>\r\n<p>“Many people thought that Deepblu was just a wearable device or a watch for diving. It is more than that. Diving itself is very enjoyable, just like flying in the blue sky. But do you know how painful it is to sit down and write the diving log afterwards? Our platform is here to solve this pain. Deepblu helps you upload what you have seen during the diving session, including dive profiles, depth value and scenes and share them with friends.”</p>\r\n<p>According to Brad, they are the first company with this technology in Taiwan. The price of the watch is set to be 10,000 NT dollars (around 300 USD).  The estimated revenue this year can hit 100 million. “I have a dream that one day human being will treat the ocean in a more friendly way. We unintentionally destroy things that we don’t understand well. The ocean is dying. However, I believe that people will change after getting to know the ocean.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>“Many people asked me how to spend the money. Well, I believe that the funding means responsibility. It’s just the beginning. You should be thinking about the next steps. </strong></p>\r\n<p>“There are 3 important things. The first is communication. As a leader, you need good communication with the board of directors and your investors. You may even want to meet with them more often than your wife (he laughed). The second is your goal. Sometimes people forget their goals after they receive funding. This may lead to inefficiency of the company’s operation.</p>\r\n<p>“Finally, controlling is important. There should be a controller in the group. This person monitors spending. There are always people who don’t know at all how their money are spent in the company.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>PicCollage: Choosing the right amount of funding</strong></p>\r\n<p>The second lecturer was the co-founder of CardinalBlue. In 2011, their photography app <a href=\"http://pic-collage.com/\">PicCollage</a> was released in 500 Startups accelerator and was downloaded for 400 thousand times in the very first month. “We realized that there weren’t that many competitors. Or, maybe PicCollage is really special.” The co-founder John Fan said that they raised 2.7 million US dollars in the silicon valley, which is a seed funding that is almost enough to be called a Series A.</p>\r\n<p><strong>“ VCs are looking for small restaurants that will become the next Mos Burger. As entrepreneurs, you have to give them the vision, even illusion.”</strong></p>\r\n<p>Raising money is like blowing up a balloon, said John. “If you tell the investors that you are a red balloon, just like Google. They believe you and give you that huge amount of money. And then, BANG! You may explode. But if you just got the right amount of money, you could become a beautiful balloon.”</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to fundraising, John has 3 advice.</p>\r\n<p>1.Most start-ups should not go immediately for VC.</p>\r\n<p>2.Be careful when choosing investors.</p>\r\n<p>3.Try to MAKE MONEY instead of going for fundraising again.</p>\r\n<p>“Many entrepreneurs say that we should be careful about money because maybe we will not get any more in the future. However, the investors may not tell you this. Listening to the investor’s advice, we moved to a new office and did lots of marketing and investment turned out not suitable for us. The investors want there money back. It’s true. But only you know what you should do!”</p>\r\n<p>“There are two kinds of start-ups: unicorns and money makers. While unicorns are relatively rare, please try to earn more money!”</p>\r\n<p><strong>“If you want our money, please figure out first what we are doing.” -Mesh Ventures</strong></p>\r\n<p>“When trying to find investment target, we want groups that jump into bigger industry, at least 1 billion worth. Mesh Ventures invest mostly on American and Asian companies, including areas like Smart City, Industry 4.0, and security-related industries. We care about what problems these systems can solve. Before coming to us, please make sure you have good explanation on the data you collected.”</p>\r\n<p>Ben Liu, co-founder of <a href=\"http://mesh.vc/\">Mesh Ventures</a> says that you can do whatever you want with the money you get. If you are in seed round or A round, you may be still working on prototypes. In series B or C, the business model is clear. You need money to make it big. Some people want to make products. Others prefer branding. It all depends on your company and the industry.</p>\r\n<p>“If there’s a group asking for 50 million dollars and as I walk in their office, I see a gigantic marble structure. I will start to ask myself: are they spending their money on marbles? And I will most likely not spend my money on this company. And finally, can money help you find the right employees? I personally think that smart guys have their own goals. They may not work for you because of those marbles. What you, as the owner of the company, want to do in the future is the key.”</p>', './img/business-561387_1280-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

(182, 'Social Enterprises Taking Off In Taiwan', '2015-11-08', 'news', '<p>Austin Yoder and David Wilson came from the US and Australia respectively to Taiwan to start their social enterprise <a href=\"http://foundationfortalentedyouth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Foundation for Talented Youth</a>. Their goal is lofty, to bring entrepreneurial skills to at least 1,000,000 people by 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are part of a global trend for social enterprises that has also come to Taiwan. Social enterprises reject the idea that the sole purpose of a business is to make as large of a profit as possible and instead consider social and economic development to be equally important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social enterprises take on social responsibilities like green consumption, fair trade, humanitarian aid, and so forth. Essentially, social enterprises use innovative approaches to do business for the good of society. Proponents of the social enterprises movement believe that every social issue also represents a business opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-profit organizations (NPOs) that traditionally has taken on social issues often have to perpetually fight to raise the resources they need to operate. Organizing as a social enterprise can enable an organization to become self-sufficient and sustainable, rather than relying on charitable donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, social enterprises beneficial to Taiwan’s overall social development. The new “changing society through consumption” charity movement has gradually begun replacing NPOs as the leaders of social change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan’s social enterprises are on the brink of taking off. More and more entrepreneurs with a sense of social obligation and creative innovation are beginning to invest to make the world a better place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Emerging Social Enterprises in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are approximately 800 social organizations in Taiwan. Of these, about 200 are corporations, and 600 are NPOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support the social enterprises intermediary organizations for promotion, social networking, fundraising, and capacity building have also begun to emerge. Gradually, the social enterprise ecosystem in Taiwan is taking shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Enterprise Action Plan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To promote sustainable innovation and growth and encourage young people to engage in social enterprises, the Executive Yuan set up the Social Enterprise Action Plan in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vision of the plan is to create an ecosystem that nurtures innovation, start-up businesses, growth, and the development of social enterprises in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be achieve in four ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Deregulation: To create a friendly legal environment for social enterprises.</li>\r\n	<li>Networking: To promote and build a social networking platform for different groups of social enterprises at home and abroad.</li>\r\n	<li>Financing: To provide multiple channels of funding through angels, VCs, credit guarantees, etc.</li>\r\n	<li>Incubation: To build an incubation mechanism for social enterprises and establish a professional support system.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Enterprise Cluster</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Because social enterprises need a base of operations in Taiwan, with the support of Premier Mao, the Premier’s former residence was officially launched to be used as the base for social entrepreneurs in May, 2015. The main reasons for using this space are as following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It can promote the concept of and raise public awareness for social enterprises, as well as act as the core networking center for social enterprises.</li>\r\n	<li>The facilities include multi-purpose workspaces, conference rooms, exhibition halls, and markets; the government can also use it as the base to promote youth start-up companies and social innovation.</li>\r\n	<li>The expertise of social entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, social movement activists, social workers, programmers, and designers can be pooled together here to build a social enterprise platform, serving as a reference guide for future social enterprise developmental policies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Enterprise Hackathon</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hackathon for Social Enterprise Clusters was held on March 28th and 29th, 2015. Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, and experts in the field were invited to join the discussions and &nbsp;&nbsp;co-found solutions in accordance with the themes of “exploring the needs and challenges of social enterprises”, and “social enterprise community clusters.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Enterprise Meet-up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of these meetings is to support the regional communities of social entrepreneurs, investors, campuses, and incubators, to hold conferences, seminars, and workshops, to spread the idea of social innovation, and to encourage more people to participate in social enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Enterprise Registration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to increase the transparency of social enterprise development, the government is going to assist the private sector set up a registration system for social enterprises utilizing a two-stage verification process (basic and advanced, which may include charity reports and financial reports). The companies that meet the qualifications for the advanced system can also acquire additional support such as mentoring, funding, incubation services, and government procurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>International Connections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So there is a lot happening with social enterprises in Taiwan and the International connections are growing. One old-timer in the social enterprise business is London-based The Big Issue which was founded in 1991 and arrived in Taiwan in 2010. The Big Issue give homeless people the chance to earn a legitimate income by selling their eponymous magazine. They believe in “help them to help themselves” and “selling, not begging”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoder and Wilson likely approve saying that “Innovation leadership skills are key tools that can enable anyone, no matter how poor, to take control of their lives and build a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine achieving all that as a sustainable, on-going social enterprise in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Social Enterprises in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border: 0px none;\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong>Foundation for Talented Youth</strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong>TownWay</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Teaching entrepreneurship to young people</td>\r\n			<td>Combine creativity and local culture to boost local economy</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>We provide innovation, leadership and critical thinking skills workshops to teenagers.</td>\r\n			<td>TownWay is geared toward promoting local tourism and industries through work-stay programs for Taiwanese youths and campuses.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>http://foundationfortalentedyouth.com/</td>\r\n			<td>www.townway.com.tw</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong>Victory Potential Development Centre for<br>&nbsp;the Disabled</strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong>The Big Issue Taiwan (TBIT)</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Create jobs for disadvantaged groups</td>\r\n			<td>Create jobs for disadvantaged groups</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Expands the diversity of unskilled job opportunities and develops new employment opportunities for the mentally and physically disabled, allowing their talent to shine.</td>\r\n			<td>TBIT employs people who are homeless or disabled to sell magazines on the streets, and allows them to keep half of their revenue as a source of income.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>www.victory.org.tw</td>\r\n			<td>www.bigissue.tw</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong>Farm-Direct</strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong>O-Power</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Improve product distribution channels and help small farmers to sell their products</td>\r\n			<td>Improve product distribution channels and help small farmers to sell their products</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Farm-Direct uses an Internet platform to help small farmers bypass the exploitations of the middleman and uses minimal packaging to give consumers eco-friendly, healthy, and convenient services.</td>\r\n			<td>O-Power not only assists farmers with organic farming through its agricultural production and marketing groups, but also manages production and marketing via a B2B platform.</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>www.farm-direct.com.tw</td>\r\n			<td>www.o-power.com.tw</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				<br>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><strong>Neways2021</strong></td>\r\n			<td><strong>Buy NearBy</strong></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Improve product distribution channels and help small farmers to sell their products</td>\r\n			<td>Improve product distribution channels and help small farmers to sell their products</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Neways2021 plans to link together all peripheral areas surrounding provincial Highways 20 and 21 into an economically viable plum-producing district.

(184, 'A nudge to startup ecosystem: Techstars’ program in Taiwan, explained by VP Innovation Chris Heivly', '2019-12-18', 'news', '<p>Last year, Techstars has launched its first ever Startup Week in Taipei, Taiwan, and this year, while the same event was underway, the community leader brought another surprise to the city — to roll out a comprehensive program for startup ecosystem development in collaboration with Qualcomm and Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA), an incubator backed by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, Taiwan “wants to do more,” to use Chris Heivly’s words. He’s the VP Innovation in the Techstars Startup Ecosystem Team and an experienced startup builder. He believes behind the ambition is the realization of “the gap between where the ecosystem is today and probably where it should be.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it matches the Techstars’ desire to expand its operations and grow footprint in Asia, the idea to collaborate with TTA has in fact been kindled a year ago. The program, different from the seed accelerator that the organization has been known for, focuses on strengthening the infrastructure of the entire startup ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45836\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45836\">Techstars, Qualcomm, and Taiwan Tech Arena launch program to build international innovation ecosystem in Taiwan</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>With multiple tools — including Startup Weekend, Hackathon, and one-on-one meetings — in hand, Techstars aims to develop a fully fledged ecosystem for founders and entrepreneurs in Taiwan, the first spot in Asia where all the tools will be leveraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Techstars will deploy these ecosystem-building tools, as in any other countries, based on a bottom-up approach. “We work with founders first and learn how to support founders,” Mr. Heivly said. “There’s an idea and a roadmap, but there isn’t a specific ‘do A, then B, then C, and then D.’” The program isn’t led by a single authority like the government.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counterintuitive as it may seem to many, he said it’s the best way to build a startup community, as opposed to how the older generation comes to their success, that is, through mastering the idea of hierarchy and structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There seems to be no plan, but the direction is clear: to bind together all the actors in the ecosystem with a “founder-centric” attitude. They all can have a role to play in this program if they wish to create meaningful connections with startups and make them stronger, said Mr. Heivly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His team seeks to facilitate engagement with universities, corporates (e.g., Qualcomm), and government (e.g., MOST and TTA) and pull them closer to the startup community through events and meetups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Heivly took corporates for instance. As in most countries, they aren’t yet well connected with the startup community in Taiwan. But there’s great potential for them to collaborate with startups: they can help startups better understand a market and startups can help them drive internal innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his team’s impact cannot be quantifiably measured, the connectivity they create can be. An indicator may be, for instance, the number of people connected through events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of following the traditional framework in which an ecosystem is measured by how many jobs it creates or how much capital it deploys, they focus on understanding how the network is formed so as to learn how and why those numbers are achieved. This, he believes, will be the “foundational work” that helps the ecosystem grow better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its high-tech pedigree and large base of potential founders, the startup ecosystem in Taiwan can be even more vibrant, said Mr. Heivly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on his observation and research, half of 1% of every given population are high-growth entrepreneurs, but there probably aren’t 115 thousand of them yet in Taiwan. “I want to bring them out,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While people tend to “culturally sit on the sidelines,” he believes they’re indeed pre-wired to start their venture — after all, he said, western thinking is embraced here. “I just need to nudge them a little bit.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45874\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45874</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-01-06 07:27:05', '2020-01-06 07:27:05', NULL),

Deeply-rooted stereotypes against them only render their living situation even more precarious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, not given any opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge at the workplace, they can struggle finding a better job after returning to their home country, and thus be forced to do unskilled, physical work again to earn a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are the first non-profit organization in Taiwan to empower these workers with education,” said Kevin Chen, co-founder of One Forty, who leads his team to run a weekend school in order to help the fast-growing minority population adapt to the new environment and improve their own lives.

His team then started to teach language courses on Youtube and offer free self-learning materials so that the workers can study Mandarin on their own in their free time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chen described the startup journey to be a series of “trial and error,” that is, repeated and varied attempts to solve newly discovered problems until success. “This is also why I think we are still a startup team,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New opportunities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from this year, One Forty has been working with a number of privately held companies, including Far EasTone Telecom, who sponsors the project of sending self-learning materials to migrant workers across Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chen believes for the organization, there’s more room for collaboration with enterprises, who have started to pay attention to this large group of immigrants. “Some of them would like to fulfill their social responsibilities as private companies by financing us,” he said. Indeed, this attempt can also create a positive brand image for enterprises if they plan to expand to Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For companies currently operating in the region, there can’t be a better talent pool other than One Forty’s school, in which the students are all local people who have learned to interact naturally with the Taiwanese. “There are already five of our students working for one Taiwanese company in Indonesia,” said Mr. Chen. They earn double to triple the amount that they might otherwise be given to do the same job and have therefore substantially improved the quality of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that everything One Forty does pertains to bridging the gap between Taiwan and Southeast Asia, especially the countries which their students call home. Following the same goal, the organization has started this year to conduct training sessions for migrant workers in Taiwan-based companies as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to social impact, Mr. Chen said One Forty tries to measure it during the two trips every year to Indonesia and the Philippines, the two main sources of migrant workers in Taiwan. “We visit our former students, go to the shops they open or the places where they work,” he said. “But since we live far from them and aren’t able to do it often, we are hoping to work with local non-profit organizations to keep fully informed of any news in their lives.”</p>\r\n<figure>\r\n	<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 800px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1580369258767.png\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 800px;\"><span class=\"fr-inner\"><br></span></span></span>One Forty visiting Indonesia / Photograph: One Forty</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chen believes from a broader perspective, what they’ve been doing also helps Taiwan shape better relations with foreign countries, a particularly crucial task for the politically isolated nation. Acting as a citizen diplomat, One Forty support migrant workers to facilitate intercultural understanding and ensure they have a positive experience in Taiwan, which, in the long run, may benefit the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, he shared with a number of like-minded organizations from around the world at International Labor Conference (ILO Conference) how One Forty empowers migrant workers with knowledge and practical skills. “A lot of them are surprised to know there’s an organization like us in Taiwan working on how to support migrants,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, social issues stemming from immigration are universal. “There’s also refugee crisis in Europe, for example,” Mr. Chen said. They require every member in the global community to combine forces to come up with innovative solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45915\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45915</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-01-06 08:53:29', '2023-09-25 14:33:50', NULL);

The hardware is also to sold to system integrators to develop their own IoT applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has leveraged the breakthrough Weightless™ LPWAN technology to become a main solution provider for Taiwan’s advanced metering infrastructure deployment, which plans to connect over three million smart meters over the next four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ubiik currently has a live network of more than 70,000 smart meter sending every 15 minutes to the hundreds of base stations spread across the country.

It estimates the figure of 2019 may hit $8M (NT$240M).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2015, Hahow encourages the skilled to pass their knowledge to those who are eager to learn something new and useful, ranging from programming, financial planning, to painting. The teachers raise funds from a crowd of students before they build the content of their courses, which later usually turn into part of the “long tail” that brings continuous flow of revenue to the site. Meanwhile, the quality of these online courses is constantly optimized as the students provide real-time feedback for the teachers over the online platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“We help teachers sell their knowledge to customers and places they can’t reach themselves,” Co-founder Arnold Chiang said. “This is how Hahow differentiates itself from competitors.”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These words seem to have defined the next steps for the startup company, who has just welcomed a new capital. For one thing, it has started to serve enterprises with its newly-launched sub-site Hahow for Business, whose content includes selected training courses for employees on topics such as presentation skills, data analysis, logical thinking, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1580368832628.png\" style=\"width: 577px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n<figure>\r\n	<figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Hahow for Business / Photograph : Hahow</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>“We hope enterprises buy a library for their employees rather than locking them in a classroom,” Mr. Chiang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of having students sit and watch videos, Hahow offers customized experience for an online environment. They’re expected to interact with their teachers and take notes at specific times during the lessons, which last only around two hours and include one to three key concepts.

But the moment the company started to think seriously about tapping into this new market is when they discovered there have been 6,000 business customers on its site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Hahow has offered some preliminary courses to a bank, hospital, and the Tourism Bureau in 2018 and to ten enterprises last year to test the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While “companies spend a lot on staff training,” Mr. Chiang and his team appear to be quite optimistic about the new service. “The calls simply never stop,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Going global</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For another, it has been gearing up for overseas expansion as the site earns 15% of the traffic from Chinese-speaking users across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a Malaysian subsidiary, Hahow has been struggling to find its place in the competitive market of China, where each content provider enjoys dominance in a course category. “By comparison, we are a site that offers ‘everything,’” Mr. Chiang described. “Therefore, we really need to be clear about whom to authorize the access to each type of our courses.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the first step, Hahow has signed a contract with streaming giant Iqiyi, but launching online courses on a Chinese site isn’t easy task. They not only need to rewrite all the subtitles and marketing content but deal with the strict Internet policy that makes video transmission unnecessarily difficult. Mr. Chiang said his team is still trying to find a solution to these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, the startup company seeks to work with foreign teachers, for example, in Japan. “There’s a lot of content that’s worth digitalizing such of the knowledge from artisans and craftsmen (shokunin),” Mr. Chiang said. “It’s what the world would want to pay to learn.” The long-term plan will expand its base of teachers, enabling the company to scale up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45910\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45910</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-01-06 08:57:39', '2023-09-25 14:33:02', NULL),

(197, 'Taiwan’s blockchain industry remains resilient, matching global trends stride for stride', '2020-01-21', '', '<p>2019 has proven to be a constructive year for the blockchain industry. It started off with crypto volumes at an all-time low and skepticism at a record high. Many projects that failed to survive the winter were quickly dead on arrival, and feasible commercial applications seemed further away than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the mass media has moved on from the fervor of 2017’s ICO craze, industry players around the globe have been powering through the downturn, effectively adjusting to a new reality. Many projects are now focusing their efforts on either underlying technical development or finding stronger real-world applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, the situation is no different. Although the country has traditionally lagged behind its Western counterparts in terms of embracing the latest innovations, it seems Taiwan has punched well above its weight when it comes to the development and adoption of blockchain. Whether it’s trending applications in gaming or decentralized finance (DeFi), advancements in the underlying infrastructure, or clarity in regulatory frameworks, Taiwan has kept pace on all fronts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Made in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There haven’t been too many new additions to the ecosystem since our last update , but we’ve seen existing players solidify their positioning in the market, with some effectively embedding themselves within the global value chain, very much in line with Taiwan’s legacy as a leading hardware manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fst.network/\" title=\"https://www.fst.network/\">FST Network</a> (AW#17), for example, has created a modularized, blockchain-based platform enabling enterprises to manage and integrate their data with ease. Their turnkey solution has now been adopted by exchanges and insurance companies in both the UK and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a similar vein, local cold wallet maker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coolbitx.com/\" title=\"https://coolbitx.com/\">CoolBitX</a> recently developed Synga Bridge, a messaging-based KYC/AML solution that is now being used by Japan-based VC Trade, a crypto exchanged owned by SBI Holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the theme of solving real-world pain points, DeFi has seemingly become the most pervasive use case, and rightly so. Existing financial systems are plagued with inefficient legacy systems that centralize data storage and authority, in turn passing on greater levies to increasingly privacy-concerned citizens. DeFi offers to provide a more transparent and secure means of accessing, lending, and transferring wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total value of DeFi projects has nearly tripled this year to over US$650 million. Although the conversations are largely dominated by opinions and analysis of MakerDAO and its stablecoin Dai, there are many upcoming projects fueling the DeFi movement. Here in Taiwan, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://easydai.app/overview\" title=\"https://easydai.app/overview\">EasyDai</a> is a decentralized exchange and lending platform that enables users to earn high-yield interest on Dai via Ethereum deposits.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://steaker.com/\" title=\"https://steaker.com/\">Steaker</a> on the other hand is a digital asset management platform that helps users invest in notable DeFi projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Working on the rails</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of development under the hood, it’s clear there is still much to be done when it comes to the widespread implementation of blockchain technology—engineering teams are still grappling with solving usability, interoperability, security, scalability, just to name a few challenges. But there’s also been a lot of progress made in these areas. Layer 2 solutions such as Plasma and Optimistic Rollup have demonstrated promising results when it comes to increasing transaction throughput and the amount of datasets that protocols like Ethereum can handle. Advancements in foundational technologies like zero knowledge proofs may finally help corporates assimilate into an increasingly privacy sensitive world. Needless to say, it’s still early days of blockchain development, and it’s anyone’s game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, some may remember the dramatic dissolution of COBINHOOD and its associated protocol initiative DEXON earlier this year, where after a series of shareholder disputes all one hundred of its staff were ultimately let go. Although a major blow to the local ecosystem, their efforts on building an infinitely scalable and more secure public chain have not gone to waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company’s co-founder and CTO Wei-Ning Huang has picked up the reins and began a project of his own dubbed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tangerine-network.io/en/\" title=\"https://tangerine-network.io/en/\">Tangerine Network</a>, which incorporates many of the same core components from DEXON’s open source code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also rising from the ashes of COBINHOOD’s demise are a legion of experienced blockchain developers, many of whom are now pursuing their own founder dreams. Lee Hsuan and Edwin Yeh, the company’s former heads of engineering and business strategy respectively, established&nbsp;<a href=\"https://portto.io/\" title=\"https://portto.io/\">portto</a> (AW#19), a startup focused on bringing blockchain usage to the masses through its seamless dApp browser Blocto.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Guiding the way</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook made headlines in 2019 with the announcement of Libra, a stable coin meant to establish a frictionless, global payments network. The original consortium consisted of 28 founding members, but five, including Visa and Mastercard, have since dropped out due to the torrent of scrutiny from regulators and policy makers alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory uncertainty and the associated legal ramifications have been the primary inhibitors of blockchain’s adoption. Different markets have embraced the technology to varying degrees, but Asia has arguably been a front runner in this area. Countries like Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have all delineated clear and definite guidelines on how blockchain companies should work and operate, some perhaps more conservative than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, startups in Taiwan are able to raise up to NT$30 million (US$1M) via STOs, and only from accredited investors with a cap of NT$100,000 per person. On the other hand, in Singapore, regulatory oversight only kicks in if an STO exceeds SG$5 million (US$3.7M) and caters to more than 50 investors or any number of non-accredited ones.\r\n	<br>While limiting in some respects, these regulations at the very least clearly stipulate the rules of the game, equipping founders with peace of mind when it comes to planning their long-term operational roadmaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The march goes on</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, blockchain is now a decade in the running. It’s been 10 years since the release of Satoshi’s whitepaper, and in this time alone, we’ve already gone through one major hype cycle, effectively catapulting the terms “bitcoin,” “crypto,” and “blockchain” from developer circles to front page news, and back again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year’s crash likely confirmed the suspicions of many skeptical onlookers. But recent advancements in the underlying technology, uptick in adoption, and growing commercial implementations are surely driving some decision-makers to develop a more loving embrace. China’s regulators and its president Xi Jinping, for example, went from a hardened, outright ban to a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-bitcoin.html\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-bitcoin.html\">endorsement</a> of blockchain technology while announcing intentions to develop a state-backed digital currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Taiwan, stakeholders are proceeding with cautious optimism. The private-public blockchain alliance created by the National Development Council (NDC) last June recently outlined a plan to explore the implementation of blockchain in five major areas: public services, finance/insurance, energy, healthcare, and agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors are also getting more savvy, no longer immediately jumping into the feeding frenzy of token sales but carefully prospecting the use of both traditional and non-traditional financial instruments when determining how to best support founders. And the community itself has maintained, if not gained in momentum, as demonstrated by the recent <a href=\"https://abasummit.io/\" title=\"https://abasummit.io/\">Asia Blockchain Summit</a> (now second year in the running) which ultimately brought out over 4,000 participants and 135 speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it’s in terms of technical development, regulatory frameworks, or community activism, Taiwan’s blockchain industry has made steadfast progress in the second half of 2019, catering to both local and international founders alike. We’re also starting to see early instances of the ecosystem maturing, with more and more blockchain founders branching out and interacting with traditional industries, while also, perhaps more importantly, setting longer term goals and ambitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45994\"></a>\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45994\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45994\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45994</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-01-22 08:48:55', '2020-02-03 03:05:20', NULL),

With firm support from the sports administration of the Ministry of Education, it kicked off the first accelerator program in Taiwan and Asia, following the 2017 Summer Universiade in Taipei, and has been working with IAPS (Center of Industry Accelerator and Patent Strategy), a local startup accelerator owned by National Chiao-Tung University, to execute it ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zvika Popper, COO of HYPE, told Business Next that before bringing their accelerator to the island, his team had been considering expanding to Asia, which he described as a “relatively new market” for sports tech companies. It hoped to set up a new base in a country where sports tech is at its early stage of development — to pick the “low-hanging fruit.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan emerged to be one of the best options. With abundant resources for startups and high-quality talent, it’s an ideal location for HYPE to launch its first Asian accelerator and expand its regional network — possibly to Southeast Asia, an area with which Taiwan has strong connection, said Mr. Popper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the business culture in Taiwan, which is relatively similar to that in the Western world, the process has been painless, according to Mr. Popper. He also gave credit to IAPS for the well-executed project, saying that they’re the most committed partner among all in their ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Meet the startups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Selected from over 150 applicants, the 13 teams in this batch had participated in a three-month training program created by HYPE later last year. It was concluded with the demo day, in which they were given the opportunity to pitch to a jury of industry experts and investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the competition were revealed on the same day: DP Smart Technology (Taiwan) and Footbot (Russia) won themselves a booth in HYPE’s signature startup exhibition, and Stryde (Hong Kong) and Red Dot Drone (Japan) a place in IAPS’s accelerator program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a batch with the most diversity among the three it has recruited for the past one year, said the organizing team.

This year, in celebration of its 30-year presence in Taiwan, Microsoft opened an AI R&amp;D center in Taipei. Other notable technology giants such as Google and NVIDIA have also made plans to establish AI R&amp;D centers in Taiwan. To meet this rising demand in AI talents, the Taiwanese government announced this year that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2019/05/26/taiwan-will-train-10000-ai-workers-per-year-for-google-microsoft-and-more-to-meet-rising-demand/\" title=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2019/05/26/taiwan-will-train-10000-ai-workers-per-year-for-google-microsoft-and-more-to-meet-rising-demand/\">10,000 AI engineers will be trained</a>. While this sounds remarkable, given that only an estimated 2<a href=\"https://jfgagne.ai/talent/\" title=\"https://jfgagne.ai/talent/\">2,000 people in the world are expert enough to initiate world-class AI projects on their own</a>, as a leader in AI talent within Greater Southeast Asia (GSEA = ASEAN + Taiwan), Taiwan is already a hub for GSEA-based companies to build their tech teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the world’s giants, more and more startups in Southeast Asia have come to Taiwan to recruit talents. From Singapore, we have startups like Carousell, and Shopback, which was part of AppWorks Accelerator #13 (AW#13), setting up their R&amp;D teams in Taiwan. As Taiwan continues to churn out top talent, the new push by <a href=\"https://ai.taiwan.gov.tw/news/cabinet-plans-to-develop-the-nations-ai-industry/\" title=\"https://ai.taiwan.gov.tw/news/cabinet-plans-to-develop-the-nations-ai-industry/\">the government to sponsor a culture of AI development</a>, and private companies to develop their AI teams here, founders in GSEA can start to consider Taiwan as a launchpad to catalyse their efforts at regional expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In AppWorks Accelerator’s semi-annual update of Taiwan’s AI Ecosystem Map, we found that in the past six months, a number of regulatory frameworks have been implemented to support the growing innovation in the field of AI and more startups and AI ecosystem builders are increasing in Taiwan. The following verticals have made significant strides in the development of AI:</p>\r\n<figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\"><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1580352914727.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"AI-Map-19H2\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-inner\"><figcaption>AI-Map-19H2 / Photograph : AppWorks</figcaption></span></span></span>\r\n	<figcaption>\r\n		<br>\r\n	</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h2>With Advertising Gaining Ground in AI, We See a Rise in Video Marketing, Customer Relationship Management, and Remarketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As Facebook’s algorithm continues to change and we’ve witnessed an explosion in data and information, it has become increasingly difficult to reach consumers with limited budgets and digital advertising spend. Companies are beginning to manage relationships with consumers through a variety of AI-driven strategies and digital tools, such as remarketing, to retain their most loyal customers. The push to provide increasingly fragmented customer audiences, and distracted loyalists with personalized experiences and products, has opened up more business opportunities for AI startups to provide marketing solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2011, <a href=\"https://ikala.tv/\" title=\"https://ikala.tv/\">iKala</a>, an online karaoke and live broadcasting platform, has transformed into a human-centered AI marketing technology company after 8 years. It is the largest partner of Google Cloud in Asia-Pacific and of Facebook for global marketing, and it is currently covering markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. They also announced the completion of their Series A round of US$ 5M early last year. Judging from the services provided by iKala, we can see that there is a rise in audiovisual marketing, influencer marketing, and results-oriented advertising solutions (also known as “performance marketing”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other startups, such as <a href=\"https://www.omnichat.my/\" title=\"https://www.omnichat.my/\">Omnichat</a> -- formerly called Easychat -- and <a href=\"https://www.rosetta.ai/\" title=\"https://www.rosetta.ai/\">Rosetta.ai</a>, both AW#16 startups, are focused on providing brand remarketing services. Instead of traditional chatbot services and other communications methods, they help small-and-medium businesses as well as enterprises use an AI model to accurately target customers to create a win-win situation for both their clients and their clients’ consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Piggybacking on the Strength of Hardware in Taiwan, Security Monitoring and Smart Home Applications Are Accelerating</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan has world-class hardware and supply chain management, and coupled with the improvement of camera manufacturing infrastructure, we can see that in regards to AI applications there have been several achievements in security monitoring and smart home appliances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By combining AI technology with security monitoring, enterprises can greatly reduce the waste of manpower and avoid human error, thereby improving the quality and safety of monitoring solutions, which they deem to be one of their most important verticals. In addition to AW#9 startup <a href=\"https://umbocv.ai/\" title=\"https://umbocv.ai/\">Umbo CV</a>, which has successfully entered the European and North American markets, there is also AW#19 startup <a href=\"https://www.beseye.com/us/home\" title=\"https://www.beseye.com/us/home\">Beseye</a>, founded in 2014. It introduced its AI computer vision solution as the human safety backbone of Japan’s Tokyu Railway. When the camera detects that someone has entered a dangerous section of track, the system will automatically notify the central control center or the station’s staff to deal with it immediately and reduce railroad crossing accidents. Beseye currently has over 2,000 corporate clients, including Chunghwa Telecom and other large enterprises. Other startups like <a href=\"https://www.ionetworks.co/\" title=\"https://www.ionetworks.co/\">ioNetworks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cycarrier.com/\" title=\"https://www.cycarrier.com/\">CyCarrier</a> are also focused on providing related security monitoring services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As modern-day working people continue to lead busy lives, there is a gradual emergence of home applications and smart home appliances that make it easier for users to care for elders, their children, and their pets. AW#10 startup <a href=\"https://www.nuwarobotics.com/\" title=\"https://www.nuwarobotics.com/\">NUWA Robotics</a> launched the first generation of their companion robots called “Keibi” in 2018. They specialize in STEAM education, theater-style English learning, and sensory interactive education. Their robots are focused on education and can also be a smart home helper. After selling over 5,000 units, they recently launched the second generation of their companion robots called “Kebbi Air” on a crowdfunding platform. They were able to raise NT $1M within half an hour of launching. Other notable startups in this space include Aeolus , which is focused on elderly care, AW#16 startup <a href=\"https://cubo.network/\" title=\"https://cubo.network/\">Cubo</a> which is focused on developing smart baby cameras, and <a href=\"https://shopus.furbo.com/\" title=\"https://shopus.furbo.com/\">Furbo</a>,which is focused on smart pet care services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AI Ecosystem Builders: Sandbox Trends, R&amp;D, and Accelerators</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the developments in AI, machine learning, and big data trends, certain legal topics are widely discussed such as copyrights and intellectual property, legal liabilities, and the impact on the existing regulatory regime in Taiwan. Two laws have been passed in 2018 to tackle these new trends: the Financial Technology Development and Innovative Experimentation Act for a fintech regulatory sandbox and the Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation and Experiment Act for autonomous vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the high degree of regulation, the use of AI in financial services is slower than other industries, but given the advantage of having large amounts of data and complete customer information, the potential business opportunities are at an all-time high. The Legislative Yuan for Taiwan has been hosting a regulatory sandbox for companies to experiment with new business models that currently don’t have a legal framework. So far, 11 applications for experimentation or testing of new forms of fintech have been filed since the sandbox was launched. Many fintech startups have also started to cooperate with large-scale financial companies. Instead of starting from the perspective of replacing the existing financial industry, they are able to create a win-win situation and reduce the anxiety of current financial players in the industry. For example, hiHedge and Fubon jointly launched the Fubon hiHedge AI Chip Strategy, which uses AI technology to calculate the chip flow of Taiwan’s daily listed stocks to provide consumers with more complete information. Other new ventures like Adenovo are focused on providing real-time smart financial solutions for financial institutions and enterprises, and have received investment from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund and Zhaofeng VC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the law passed to promote the usage of autonomous vehicles, it is considered one that may provide a more friendly environment for testing the application of AI and IoT technology in transportation. Taiwan will be well-positioned in the autonomous vehicle industry due to its experience in supplying high-quality components for electronics as various high-profile domestic and international players have joined Taiwan’s autonomous vehicle market. The government is organizing a national team for the development of autonomous vehicles and has set out a plan to prepare for the advent of the autonomous vehicle era in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more and more AI startups emerging, Taiwan is also booming with startup accelerators, education, and research. <a href=\"https://appworks.tw/accelerator/\" title=\"https://appworks.tw/accelerator/\">AppWorks Accelerator</a>, established in 2010 and currently focused on serving AI and Blockchain founders, has so far helped SEA founders launch over 40 AI/IoT startups into the market and continues to inject new energy into Taiwan’s AI ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/\" title=\"https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/\">Microsoft for Startups</a>, Taiwan AI x Robotics Accelerator, and many others, are all startup accelerators focused on recruiting AI founders. Taiwan AI School and Taiwan AI Labs are Taiwan’s represented institutions in the field of AI education and research. From 2020 and beyond, more and more resources are expected to be injected into the development of the AI field, which should further solidify Taiwan’s position as an AI hub in the GSEA region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-01-30 02:55:58', '2020-02-03 03:07:09', NULL),

(203, 'Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree Ray Chiu raises $5M for his biotech startup Calyx', '2020-02-04', '', '<p>In July, 2014, when a series of natural gas explosions ripped through the city of Kaohsiung overnight, Ray Chiu was in California studying for his Master’s degree at UC Berkeley. Disconcerted, he called the relatives who live not far from the area where the deadly disaster occurred. He had stayed at their apartment during the months of military service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these scenes of devastation stamped on his memory, he made up his mind to optimize the existing solution for chemical detection. Five years later, he landed a spot on the Forbes “30 Under 30\" list in energy for the success of his startup <a href=\"https://calyxtechs.com/\" title=\"https://calyxtechs.com/\">Calyx</a> (renamed, formerly BioInspira), the first ever company to build gas sensor with bacteriophage, a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calyx has so far raised a $5M seed round from venture capitalists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and the US, making its founder a bright shining star among the legions of Taiwanese entrepreneurs based in Silicon Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Phage, explained</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>His sensor is based upon phage, a unique type of biomaterial that is reusable and resilient to any temperature and chemicals of any pH values, unlike many other sensors that aren’t designed to withstand harsh conditions in industrial environments. Instead, they’re for laboratory testing only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s true that electrochemical and some biomaterial-based ones can be turned to Internet-connect devices for real-time monitoring, but they don’t last more than one or two years. Thanks to phage, Calyx\'s sensor can last five to seven years on average. What’s more, the product is highly flexible and customizable because the biomaterial can be genetically modified to detect a certain type of chemical element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with its so-called “Sensors as a Service Platform,” Calyx serves not only food and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) companies but poultry farms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Birds have a respiratory system that are very different from that of mammals. For humans, most of the air we breathe in doesn’t reach our lungs, but for birds, their lungs are constantly ventilated because the air sacs permit,” explained Mr. Chiu. “Their respiratory tract is thus more prone to infection.” Calyx’s gas sensor can ensure the air is healthy enough for the birds to inhale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Startup for social good</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s difficult to build connections as a Taiwanese person in the Silicon Valley, Mr. Chiu put it bluntly. “At first, we have to show up at activities and events of all kind to know as many people as possible.” He also recounted the experience of taking part in a meeting as one of the two only Asians in the venue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it’s only after given cold shoulder by countless investors did he make it to raise $5M from a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of his journey, Mr. Chiu said the key lies not only in partners but in determination along the way. “Some think one has to have a brilliant idea to startup a business, but I don’t.” For him, startups ultimately “serve the social good,” and for that reason, one should go about turning an idea into action as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the notion of serving the society is also hidden behind the name of his startup, Calyx, which literally means the outermost whorl of flower parts. “It’s an important structure that protects the flower,” said Mr. Chiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Cal,” in the name, can also signify the University of California, where he started the company in a lab. And the remaining “x” and “y,” associated with the two types of chromosome, imply the potential of the next generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, Mr. Chiu said the most effort will be put into sales promotion and Series A fundraising. “I’ve changed my mindset. It’s no big deal to be rejected,” he said, with a laugh. “I won’t feel that I’m not good enough because I’m not invested.” It’s this fearlessness toward failure, perhaps, that leads to Calyx’s success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46037\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46037</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-02-05 06:21:42', '2020-02-05 06:21:42', NULL),

According to Appier’s press release, “His business acumen, thorough thinking, and precise judgment have helped many growing companies succeed.”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Dr. Chien is a proven and distinguished technology expert,” said Mr. Yu. “We are happy to welcome him as our independent board member and to leverage his significant industry know-how in driving Appier’s continued success and long-term growth.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not long ago, Appier had just <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760\">raised US$80M Series D round</a>, pushing its VC funding to the tune of $162M.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Chien is looking forward to his new role as a board member, too. “I’ve witnessed Appier’s growth since its early days and have been impressed by its success and the resilience and vision of the founding team,” he said. “Appier, as a leader in AI solutions, will be part of transforming Taiwan into a human capital-oriented business landscape.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His optimism about the future of AI application couldn’t be more clear, given that he chose to join two AI companies less than a month after retiring from Google. “Taiwan has a great opportunity in AI development, thanks to its legacy in hardware manufacturing and the increasing strength of the software industry,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his conversation with iKala\'s CEO Sega Cheng, Dr. Chien stressed the importance for Taiwanese companies to be adventurous as entrepreneurs of the previous generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“He said Taiwan is surrounded by sea and short of natural resources.

(211, 'Meet Komodo Monitr, New Zealand-based startup aiming to unlock greater athletic potential with data analytics', '2020-02-14', '', '<p>\"Running a startup is like riding a roller coaster,\" said Jack Wood, co-founder &amp; BD director of <a href=\"https://www.komodomonitr.com/\" title=\"https://www.komodomonitr.com/\">Komodo Monitr</a>. “If you’re doing a startup, you’ve got to love what you do because no one is forcing you to do it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks earlier, the New Zealand based startup had just finished a two-month training program at Hype SPIN sports accelerator in Taipei, Taiwan. It culminated in a <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45997\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45997\">demo day</a>, where they pitched to an illustrious group of investors and industry experts about their software platform for coaches to track the performance and physical conditions of their athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sat down for a conversation with the Komodo team, asking what motivates them to start the venture, what keeps them passionate about what they do, and what brings them to the island some thousand miles away from the Kiwi land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sitting next to Mr. Wood was co-founder &amp; CEO Chris Bacon, who has four years of experience in Premier League in England and a PhD at sports science. The product that Komodo offers, in fact, is largely based upon his research project at the university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I wanted to do research that makes difference and can be used every single day,” he told us. By helping amateur athletes develop skills and avoid injury, the software will unlock greater athletic potential, as he explained Komodo’s vision on the demo day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taking research into the real world</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“Over the past few years, there has been a 60% increase in youth sport injuries,” said Mr. Bacon. They mainly result from overtraining and poor well-being caused by malnutrition, dehydration, stress, and sleep deprivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Athletes suffering from bad physical and mental conditions cannot perform well as they can at most times. The situation only worsens when they try to do exercises they normally do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, S&amp;C (strength and conditioning) coaches often struggle to prepare the athletes under their supervision. In most cases, coaches ask them to fill out surveys in order to understand their body conditions and end up with massive amount of data that are difficult to process. This is where Komodo’s app comes in — to automate the coach’s job, so “they can go and coach instead of having to go through spreadsheets,” said Mr. Bacon.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1581734496546.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668384-32158@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668384-32158@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668384-32158@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"komodo monitr\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Komodo Monitr\'s solution / Photograph: Komodo Monitr</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The app automatically collects objective health data, including sleep time, heart rate, and walking distance, from the smartwatch that athletes wear. In the meantime, they’re tasked with inputting some data — about their diet, stress level, and so on — into the app on their own. Combining facts and opinion, the software is able to generate insights into how athletes can get the most out of training without hurting themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smartwatch isn’t a must have, Mr. Bacon added. But the more data the app collects, the better the advice it can possibly offer. The team is also looking to secure a manufacturing partner in Taiwan to provide the hardware for its customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gave an example to explain the type of advice available: an athlete, who is able to squat 200 kilograms, may have difficulty doing so after a night of one-hour sleep. Instead of sticking to the same weight, the app would suggest that they do 150. “We adapt the program based on the response from athletes,” he concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the app, athletes are also allowed to report injuries and inform their coaches if they’ve done extra training sessions, which can lead to fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Next big development we are doing is being able to develop a program for each athlete,” said Mr. Bacon. The app may suggest that an athlete do a certain number of pushups and pullups, once powered by artificial intelligence in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Towards the number one choice for developing athletes worldwide</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Positioning itself as a sports analytics software, Komodo helps coaches to supervise and develop amateur athletes with an easy-to-use dashboard. It’s now sold as a service to coaches of school teams and sports clubs on a B2B basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We work with any sport, from football to rugby,” Mr. Bacon pointed out. It’s one of the major advantages that allow the startup to stand out from competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, the market value for such type of software stands at $5B and it’s growing, he said. “A lot of competitors in the space sit in elite sports.” It’s in fact only until recent years that entrants started to emerge in the amateur space, as the awareness towards data collection rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Bacon believes that data, once properly analyzed, can be a valuable asset. For instance, athletes may use them to build resume and apply for universities, and college scouts may use them to find the best players for their teams.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1581734496416.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"komodo monitr\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Komodo Monitr\'s vision / Photograph: Komodo Monitr</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>“We want to become the number one choice for developing athletes worldwide,” he said, by helping them monitor high-quality data. The startup expects to close its seed round of funding in February and expand into Australian market this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given their plan to go global, they jumped at the opportunity when offered a place at the Taipei-based accelerator, Mr. Bacon told us. The resources and connections with major sports brands that they then would have access to are another pull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of Taiwan, besides a manufacturing hub where they seeks to find a wearable maker to work with, he said it’s a test bed for East and Southeast Asian market. The two co-founders have considered offering their service to private schools in Taiwan such as Taipei American School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, their experience in Taiwan seems positive. “Everybody is keen to help you succeed here, ” said Mr. Wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46078\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46078</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-02-15 02:43:04', '2020-02-15 02:43:33', NULL);

The virus has claimed at least one life in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philiphines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the spectre of the epidemic looms over the world, the demand for face masks spike and thereby leads to <a href=\"https://qz.com/1793749/wuhan-coronavirus-mask-shortage-illustrates-basic-economic-theory/\" title=\"https://qz.com/1793749/wuhan-coronavirus-mask-shortage-illustrates-basic-economic-theory/\">shortage</a> and skyrocketing of their prices. In Japan, two packs of seven masks could cost up to 99,999 yen ($910), when the retail price per pack is set at 405 yen, according to <a href=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200206/p2g/00m/0na/011000c\" title=\"https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200206/p2g/00m/0na/011000c\">The Mainichi</a>.

Now, the price of face masks stands at NT$5 ($0.17) per piece, and panic — over having no mask to wear and therefore being exposed to the deadly virus — has been abating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, prime minister Su Tseng-chang <a href=\"https://udn.com/news/story/120940/4345088\" title=\"https://udn.com/news/story/120940/4345088\">announced</a> that around 10 million masks will be produced each day by the end of February. It’s more than a fivefold rise in production within a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the countries closest to the epicenter of the virus outbreak, the number of confirmed cases has been relatively low, too. In addition, two out of 20 virus patients in Taiwan have fully recovered, authorities revealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Government efforts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Surely, much of the credit goes to the government. First and foremost, it was rather quick to ban all the flights from China, in early February. In the meantime, border control has been tightened and measures enforced to ensure citizens with travel history to China isolate themselves for two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authorities have also geared up for the possible spread of the coronavirus. Two weeks ago, minister of health and welfare Chen Shih-chung <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3873436\" title=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3873436\">led a medical screening</a> on SuperStar Aquarius as the ship berthed at the port of Keelung. He stressed that the medical staff is extremely cautious in ensuring the health of people in Taiwan. Fortunately, all 1,700 passengers were tested negative for the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to the panic buying of face masks, the government put an embargo on the exports of masks at the first moment and later worked with programmers to <a href=\"https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-mask-real-name-system/\" title=\"https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-mask-real-name-system/\">roll out an ID-based rationing system in just 72 hours</a>. It allows citizens to purchase two pieces of masks at a time after presenting their health insurance card in a pharmacy. The premier <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3874734\" title=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3874734\">said</a> the system is likely to be phased out by the end of February, when the supplies of masks will be replenished.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Solid foundations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Such feat couldn’t have been possible without the country’s superior healthcare system, which has just ranked No. 1 in the world for the second time, according to <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/11/2003730760\" title=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/11/2003730760\">Numbeo</a>’s survey, and its cloud database built five years ago. Taiwan’s robust and reliable communications infrastructure also prevents the new online system from crashing due to high traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Premier Su attributes the successful launch of the system to the solidarity between the government, industry, and civil society, according to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gogogoeball/videos/614860152417676/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCSV8c4uySHdvEcF44EHTeBsQ-XvViK9UUf9ci0-kDjEERabVPj0Slpvj-901wNbzTyQE2MvYc-A3D0xg3URSUVj9MFeaHeudG4cun7x7zuCZMBuYoN8kP2XvzMK43xH7rnAYafdcyf8nExRZ_8EnwyqDzEWLqNHouOFeyMgYGS_J_voUZYuw-mwIDfy7pqy_p2irhYv3OqkFGFdYzBF_UE8do75ySx7Xgi1DOMgoe7cZhWXXWkt3m93GB6GXxLURlaaH-RrTDIoGYTlDD_WeLSYdD5E8RzgLteTJYm7byOZ6nrJ3CLDTdAUVJnqE5bZ4yJZ0OSJZ3H-lhJ8k8hTFbyGjPeEw&amp;__tn__=-R\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/gogogoeball/videos/614860152417676/?__xts__[0]=68.ARCSV8c4uySHdvEcF44EHTeBsQ-XvViK9UUf9ci0-kDjEERabVPj0Slpvj-901wNbzTyQE2MvYc-A3D0xg3URSUVj9MFeaHeudG4cun7x7zuCZMBuYoN8kP2XvzMK43xH7rnAYafdcyf8nExRZ_8EnwyqDzEWLqNHouOFeyMgYGS_J_voUZYuw-mwIDfy7pqy_p2irhYv3OqkFGFdYzBF_UE8do75ySx7Xgi1DOMgoe7cZhWXXWkt3m93GB6GXxLURlaaH-RrTDIoGYTlDD_WeLSYdD5E8RzgLteTJYm7byOZ6nrJ3CLDTdAUVJnqE5bZ4yJZ0OSJZ3H-lhJ8k8hTFbyGjPeEw&amp;__tn__=-R\">his Facebook post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, with the help of digital minister Audrey Tang, a public API (application programming interface) allowing access to the data on the cloud, such as pharmacy locations and the inventory level of face masks in each spot, has been made available. Developers are therefore given an opportunity to create new applications to contribute to the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the minister herself has set up a <a href=\"https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/\" title=\"https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/\">platform</a> with some local organizations to gather all the apps, ranging from maps, virtual assistants, to chatbots.

Lee Chun-Yi, Deputy Secretary-General to the President, Audrey Tang, Minister without Portfolio, Chen Jen-ran, Ambassador-at-large, and Raymond Greene, AIT Deputy Director jointly announced that 2020 Presidential Hackathon would be open for submission of proposals from March 2 to April 17. The event will be supervised by the Office of the President, organized by the Executive Yuan, co-organized by the Board of Science and Technology and National Development Council, and implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This year marks the 3rd anniversary of the event. The National Development Council will be the coordinator for national data support in the 2020 Presidential Hackathon. Hackers from the private sector are encouraged to work with the public sector using open-source data to enhance the innovation and efficiency of public services. Representatives from the Legislative Yuan, Examination Yuan, Control Yuan, and central and local governments were also present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deputy Secretary-General to the President Lee said that the Presidential Hackathon aims to facilitate public-private collaboration by organizing a competition and to innovate public services using open-source data. Under the theme of sustainable development, this year\'s event focuses on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN in 2015 and includes a parallel international track, demonstrating Taiwan\'s determination to expand partnerships and address global and regional issues. We hope that cross-border, cross-agency and cross-domain talents will come up with collaborative proposals and solutions to diverse sustainability issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambassador-at-large Chen quoted the slogan of g0v in his remarks: Do not ask why there is nobody doing this. You have to admit that you are the \"nobody\". Almost all of the ten winning teams of the Presidential Hackathon of the previous two years have started to implement their proposals. According to Ambassador Chen, he was glad to see concrete results achieved jointly by the government and experts from the private sector. The event this year aims to bring together teams from different countries to address the current public health emergency and environmental issues, such as climate change, and foster international cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AIT Deputy Director Greene pointed out that Hackathon is an integral part of solutions to global issues. It is estimated that 2.5 billion people will move to urban areas in the next three decades, imposing great challenges on economic development, environment, and the well-being of people. City governance, thus, will become important. Taiwan will spare no effort to contribute to the solutions to social issues. Mr. Green highlighted the longstanding US-Taiwan partnership in addressing global issues by pointing out that the friendship between the US and Taiwan and their concerted efforts have enabled mutual benefits and significant development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minister without Portfolio Tang stated that the Presidential Hackathon in 2018 and 2019 were themed around \'social innovation\' and \'smart nation\' respectively with a total of 236 teams. The winners\' proposals have become not only references for policy implementation but role models for local initiatives going global. For example, in 2018, the team \"Saving Water Resources\" from Taiwan Water Corporation was invited to participate in a hackathon in New Zealand immediately after winning the award; in 2019, the team \"Rounding Team\" from the Ministry of Health and Welfare went to Columbia University in New York to present their proposal.

However shocking, it’s a tip of the iceberg as this damaging crime is on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formerly known as man-in-the-email attack, BEC is a sophisticated type of scam in which a hacker compromises business email accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds, as the FBI defines. The US agency has been tracking the financial cyber threat since 2013, and revealed in its <a href=\"https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf\" title=\"https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf\">2019 Internet crime report</a> that BEC, though accounts for only 5% of the reported cases of fraud, causes 50% of the loss from all cyber activities last year.

As a Chrome extension, it goes through each email in Gmail to ensure it’s not tampered with during transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With ChkSender installed, the user has access to an array of data about the sender of any given email, including server location, domain name, and domain owner. Meanwhile, the extension verifies the sender’s identity based on these data and examines other parts of the email like address and the message body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before sending out an email, the user is offered two options to protect themselves from potential fraud: to sign the email with a digital signature and record a copy on the blockchain, or encrypt the entire email with a password known only by the recipient (who has installed the extension to Chrome).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former allows ChkSender to compare the footprints in the received email and on the blockchain and tell if the email is altered in transit; if so, it means that the mail server may have been hacked. The latter prevents attackers from changing what’s been written in the email in a rather straightforward way, since the recipient is supposed to be the only person capable of decrypting and later reading it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the next step, according to its CTO, BlockChain Security expects to develop a version for Outlook users and build AI into the product so that it can analyze what the message in the email means and better identify hackers who pretend to sound like the sender when illegally rewriting the email. The extension is currently free for download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ChkSender is the two-year-old company’s second application, following Blockchain Witness, an app used for evidence collection launched last year in July. With this blockchain solution, the user can take photos, record videos, or do screenshots while ensuring that these data are trustworthy enough to be presented in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app uses GPS to pinpoint when and where a piece of evidence is collected, and as a unique digital footprint (hash value) is generated, a copy of it will be recorded on the blockchain. What the user needs to do to authenticate the evidence in court is to compare the two footprints in the device and on the blockchain. If there isn’t a mismatch, the evidence is tamper-proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long run, CEO Po Huang said the team plans to build a “cloud platform for blockchain solutions” across a wide range of use cases and go global.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>News source is from <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/45253\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/45253\">Business Next</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46132\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46132</a> &nbsp;</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-03-05 06:15:26', '2020-03-31 01:54:28', NULL),

With over 20 years of academic experience in AI, knowledge discovery, and natural language processing, he is the third scientist to be invited to join the team. He called Appier “the first international AI company born in Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his teaching career at National Taiwan University (NTU), Dr. Lin famously set up the Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining lab and won six championships in the KDD Cup, an annual data mining competition organized by the Association for Computing Machinery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, as a former consultant, he helped Appier optimize a machine learning model that detects hesitant online shoppers, following its <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45571\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45571\">acquisition of Japanese startup Emin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taking research into the real world</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before joining the team, Dr. Lin said he had met Appier’s Co-founder and CEO Chih-Han Yu in major AI conferences and was pleased to see how the startup tries to keep up with the latest tech trends. “Appier puts a lot of focus on turning research results into new products and services,” Mr. Lin added.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1583717724405.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1583485940-72064@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1583485940-72064@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1583485940-72064@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Appier Chief Machine Learning Scientist\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Appier Chief Machine Learning Scientist Dr. Shou-De Lin / Photograph : Appier</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>As a former professor and Chief Machine Learning Scientist for Appier, one of his main missions is to bridge the gap and facilitate the synergy between industry and academia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I am already immersed with my colleagues and I look forward to both working alongside and guiding them in further developing solutions that not only solve challenges for our customers but also open up new business opportunities,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Lin believes the experience in the startup will give him the opportunity to understand and learn from the market that new AI applications can benefit in many ways, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He compared building an AI model to taking an exam: “It’s easy to score 60 (out of 100), but difficult to score 90, and the 30 points (for optimization) is what makes all the difference.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides recruiting experts from the university, Co-founder and CEO Mr. Yu also announced in the press conference another way his company promotes the collaboration between industry and academia: by sponsoring the newly-launched Appier AI Chair Professor Program. He said the goal of the program is to “invite experts from around the world to come to Taiwan and train local talent.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Appier has been running a program since 2016 to sponsor selected students to attend top conferences like NeuroIPS, ICML, and ICLR and present their research findings. So far, over a hundred have benefited from the program and stood on the global stage to showcase Taiwan’s research capabilities in AI, according to the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With past experience in the university, Mr. Yu and his team understand well how important yet challenging it is to turn insights derived from research studies into valuable, real-life applications. “Researchers has a quite different perspective than us,” he said. That’s why the company strives to build a bridge between the two worlds by offering travel grants for students and inviting them to share what they’ve learnt with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Trends and challenges</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The evolution of AI will bring about a paradigm shift in technological development,” said Dr. Ming-Syan Chen, Executive Vice President of NTU. “Exploring innovation in AI is one of the most important topics in the global technology community.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed out three areas where AI has the most potential: healthcare, manufacturing, and the service sector.

This article provides answers to some frequently asked questions according to the latest information released by the Centers for Disease Control under the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Which countries and territories are classified as affected areas that will require me to undergo 14-day home quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>All foreign nationals are forbidden from entering Taiwan starting March 19, with exceptions for those who hold Alien Resident Certificates or documents proving they are on urgent diplomatic, business or other special missions. All entrants are now required to undertake 14-day home quarantine, regardless of nationality.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>How is 14 days prior to arrival defined?</strong>\r\n	<br>If a passenger arrives in Taiwan on April 15, the 14 days prior to arrival will be April 1-14.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Must I undergo quarantine if I have a passport from a listed country but have not been there in the past 14 days?</strong>\r\n	<br>Arrivals are only subject to quarantine if they have been in a country or territory under a level three travel advisory in the past 14 days, including airport transfers through China, Hong Kong, Macao and Dubai.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Can I shorten the quarantine period if I spend time in a third country before arriving in Taiwan?</strong>\r\n	<br>No. The quarantine will be enforced for all those who have visited a specified country or territory in the past 14 days, including airport transfers through China, Hong Kong, Macao and Dubai.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>When does the quarantine process start?</strong>\r\n	<br>Immediately upon landing at the airport. Arrivals will be given a health declaration and home quarantine notification form before passing through immigration, which they must complete and sign. This form can be filled in <a href=\"https://hdhq.mohw.gov.tw/\">electronically</a> to save time.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Where does quarantine take place?</strong>\r\n	<br>Quarantine takes place at your home or at your planned place of stay in Taiwan. As of March 17, foreign nationals can rent a room in a public quarantine center. Please call 1922 (toll free) for more details.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>How to travel to your place of quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>Arrivals subject to quarantine must not take public transport. If you do not have a private vehicle, regularly disinfected taxis with drivers wearing protective gloves and surgical masks are available at all Taiwan airports. All passengers must wear a surgical mask during transport.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>What must I do during quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>Stay in your accommodation. Do not go outside or leave the country. Keep daily records of your body temperature and any symptoms as listed in the health declaration and home quarantine notice.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>What should I do if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, breathing difficulty, headache and fatigue) occur during quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>If you experience any of these symptoms, wear a surgical mask and call 1922 to obtain instructions on seeking medical attention. Telemedicine services are also available for those in quarantine.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Are there any mental health support services I can access during quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>A toll-free hotline 1925 can provide counseling services for those in quarantine.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Can I leave my accommodation to buy food or other items?</strong>\r\n	<br>Leaving your accommodation is strictly prohibited until the end date indicated on the quarantine form.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>If I agree to leave Taiwan can I leave quarantine early?</strong>\r\n	<br>Leaving Taiwan before the end of the quarantine period is strictly prohibited.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Will anyone check on me? What happens if I break the rules?</strong>\r\n	<br>You will be checked on once or twice a day by officials in charge of quarantine. Leaving your accommodation will result in a fine of up to NT$1,000,000 (US$33,063).\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Must I be alone in my accommodation during quarantine?</strong>\r\n	<br>Quarantine is a precautionary measure for people who do not have symptoms, but there is no need to avoid contact with others staying with you if you are feeling well. But you should maintain a social distance of at least one meter and observe strict hand hygiene. Other measures include keeping your accommodation clean and well-ventilated, sticking to a designated quarantine room, disinfecting the kitchen, bathroom and door handles daily, as well as avoiding sharing towels.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Is home quarantine the same as 14-day self-health management?</strong>\r\n	<br>Arrivals who have visited a country or territory subject to a level one or level two travel advisory are asked to conduct 14-day self-health management. This involves taking your temperature daily, wearing a surgical mask in public, avoiding crowded places and watching for symptoms. Unlike quarantine, self-health management does not require people to stay in their accommodation.

(223, 'Taipei-based Italian entrepreneur breaks into international markets with his solution helping game apps acquire real users', '2020-03-11', 'Startup News', '<p>Imagine you’re a mobile game developer, who invests millions of dollars in developing a game. After around a year of struggle with the team, you finally release it on App Store and Google Play — only to realize it’s a drop in the ocean of the six million games in these online stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you try and build stickiness into your product, you might need to double down on paid user acquisition. It’s indeed one of the few, if not the only, ways to be noticed in the deluge of game apps when you don’t have a large user base of early adopters. Unfortunately, here comes another challenge: statistics show that 40% of the online ad spending goes to fake users and 59.5% is wasted on users who don’t even spend a dime on the app. In other words, investing on these ads is pretty much like pouring money down the drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what Stefano Roncari encountered when he was working on his previous startup in Beijing. He and his team spent a lot on promoting their game but didn’t see many users download it on their phone, let alone paying for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most games die exactly because of the low return on ad spend, he told Business Next. “The average cost for acquiring a user is much higher than the revenue you can get from a user.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Looking into the black box</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fraud is one of the most common issues around online ads, including fake clicks and installations. “On mobile phones, every app is like a black box,” Mr. Roncari said. Unlike on a web browser where cookies are available, it’s almost impossible to know how the user uses the app, what they search, or even if they’re real users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can also happen that an ad publisher “steals” an organic user, claims that the advertiser acquires it by running a pay-per-download campaign on one of its pages, and asks for a fee. “It’s easy to cheat but difficult to catch a cheater,” he said. What’s worse, an ad publisher can charge the advertiser more for a user they buy from another publisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help game publishers avoid these pitfalls and attract high quality users, Mr. Roncari co-founded <a href=\"https://www.bubbleye.com/\" title=\"https://www.bubbleye.com/\">Bubbleye</a> in Taipei in 2016 to launch Kraken, “the world’s first user acquisition autopilot.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maximize ROI, the AI-powered solution optimizes the advertising strategy — how it allocates budget by channel, country, and ad placement — as it monitors and controls campaigns across multiple platforms and channels in real time. It would take some weeks for a group of human advertising managers to achieve the same results.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1584585521330.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1581684400-66514@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1581684400-66514@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1581684400-66514@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"BUBBLEYE.JPG\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Kraken, a fully automated platform for mobile game publishers that auto-optimizes advertising campaigns across platforms in real time. / Photograph : Bubbleye</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>“Every second, it sees who has seen your ad, who has clicked on it, how many of them have installed, in which location they are, what time they click it, and how they behave after installing your app,” Mr. Roncari explained. “All these data are used to verify if the users are authentic and assess how much they’re worth.” The autopilot can also stop allocating budget to sites that bring in fake users and re-invest in others that bring in real users right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To use their service, an advertiser needs to offer “a definition of a good source of users” for the AI to learn, adapt, and spend the budget in the goal of achieving positive ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We provide a dashboard for our clients, but they normally check it only once in a week because everything is automated.” Mr. Roncari also said there isn’t yet a similar auto-optimization solution for apps in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike ad platforms that charge advertisers by cost per acquisition, Bubbleye prides itself on positioning the autopilot as an unbiased, third party platform so that it can not only identify fraud and inefficiencies but actively deal with it to make better use of ad budgets. “We bring in good users, [without concerning] where they come from,” Mr. Roncari concluded. “We become game publishers’ friend.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, since they’re not involved in the cash flow (between ad platforms and advertisers), their clients are willing to share their data, collected from mobile measurement partners, with them while they wouldn\'t do so with other ad platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YiJGKh4HfUI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bubbleye Mobile Targeting : Kraken</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From Taiwan to the world</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Roncari told us that many people ask them if they would automate advertising for other types of clients in the future besides game publishers. “Every mountain is climbed one step at a time,” he said, noting their solution applies to many other industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the team’s experience in gaming industry, the sheer size of the market also prompts them to focus on user acquisition for game apps first. According to Mr. Roncari, a mid-sized game publisher spends around $10M to $50M to gain online exposure every month, and one fourth of the mobile advertising spending worldwide, about $50B, goes to mobile games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headquartered in Taipei, Bubbleye now serves clients across the world, from East Asia, West Asia, North America, to Europe. “Because of word of mouth, we get to offer services to clients we have never thought before,” Mr. Roncari said with excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked about why basing his business in Taipei, he said it allows easy access to engineering talent, funding, and global markets. Most importantly, he lives a happy and productive life here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selected to join the first <a href=\"https://mobileonlyx.com/\" title=\"https://mobileonlyx.com/\">MOX (Mobile Only Accelerator)</a> cohort, he and his team had visited Taipei for the first time after staying in Beijing for 13 years, and decided to relocate within a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2020 seems to be a year of turning point for the five-year-old company. With a new round of funding raised months earlier from Taiwan-based <a href=\"http://www.darwin-venture.com.tw/english/index.html\" title=\"http://www.darwin-venture.com.tw/english/index.html\">Darwin Venture</a>, it plans to expand its team and go global in 2021.

Major investors include the Arm IoT fund and the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund; the former is an early-stage fund sponsored by Arm Holdings, a global semiconductor company owned by the Japanese Softbank Group and its Vision Fund, and the latter is a fund managed by the WI Harper Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2014, the company has been known for its smart home devices, NextDrive Cube and Plug. It pivoted to energy management in 2017 and later secured a Series A round led by the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund for its hardware design and data-gathering technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, NextDrive announced that the two devices will no longer be sold in Taiwan and NextDrive Connect, the app that connects them with mobile devices, will be unavailable by the end of August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the company has been developing its energy management business in Japan, where it introduces Cube J1 to promote the implementation of Home Energy Management System (HEMS), a technology platform that monitors and automates the use of energy within households. Connected with smart meters, the device serves as a gateway to such platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NextDrive says the energy market in Japan is still in its early stage of development. But the demand for devices like Cube J1 can be huge, as the Japanese government plans to install 80 million smart meters by 2023, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/47126/taiwan-startup-nextdrive-iot-energy-management-solution-welcomed-by-japanese-market\" title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/47126/taiwan-startup-nextdrive-iot-energy-management-solution-welcomed-by-japanese-market\">Business Next</a>. The firm has been selling this solution to Chubu Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, two of Japan’s ten leading energy companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the liberalization of the energy market, these companies are then allowed to sell Cube J1 to households to know how they consume electricity so as to better decide how much to supply and thus reduce the cost of generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the product, consumers are able to monitor their use of electricity and lower utility bills. It also allows them to store electricity from the grid during off-peak hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the strategic investment from Arm IoT Fund, NextDrive says it looks to expand into other global markets and plans to further develop its services based on Pelion, Arm’s IoT platform that integrates connectivity technology with data and connected devices management.

It has also become commonplace for people to have their temperature checked before entering public spaces, especially hospitals and clinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, infrared temperature systems for mass screening can be seen in many high pedestrian areas like train stations and shopping malls. Earlier in March, Taipei Metro announced it may refuse to offer transport services to passengers that present a body temperature higher than 38°C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation, grim as it is for everyone, has proved to be a boon for thermometer manufacturers in Taiwan like <a href=\"https://taidoc.com/\" title=\"https://taidoc.com/\">Taidoc</a>; it\'s expecting to sell twice the amount of forehead thermometers in March than it did in February.

For example, <a href=\"http://ade.tw/\" title=\"http://ade.tw/\">ADE Technology</a>, a company developing its own camera lens module for infrared temperature screening, says it expects to ramp up its annual production to 200,000 units by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local schools have been installing the aforementioned module on their own surveillance camera to undergo temperature scans for students and teachers before they enter the campus. With the gadget installed, the surveillance camera can measure their temperature when they’re one to two meters away from it and report cases of fever in real time.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1585272819118.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Surveillance camera\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>ADE Technology\'s camera lens module installed on surveillance camera. / Photograph : Business Next</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire system serves as a convenient replacement for ear thermometers, which are widely used in many public spaces. For schools, a module for an existing camera is also way more affordable than a new set of screening facilities. In response, ADE Technology stated that it plans to lower the price of its proprietary surveillance system, making it one quarter to one fifth of the price of similar systems manufactured by international brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The world’s smallest smart thermometer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iweecare.com/\" title=\"https://www.iweecare.com\">iWEECARE</a> is another startup that has received benefit and shown to be beneficial to combat the virus outbreak. The five-year-old company has been known for its mini wearable thermometer named Temp Pal. It’s so far the world’s smallest smart thermometer, which connects to the cloud and an app on the phone to provide real-time access to temperature data. Approved in the US and EU, it’s also a precise thermometer with a range of +/- 0.05 degrees of accuracy.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1585272819176.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Temp Pal\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Temp Pal, a wearable thermometer that connects to an app on the phone to provide real-time access to temperature data. / Photograph : iWEECARE</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>As a B2C company, iWEECARE\'s target customers have long been mother-to-be and parents with newborn kids, who are sensitive to changes in body temperature. It’s only until recent months that it sees a significant growth as a B2B business. Since January, orders for Temp Pal from medical institutions across the world have been flowing in, including orders from Thailand and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major reason behind such growth is their competitive advantage: Temp Pal allows healthcare workers to check the body temperature of multiple patients simultaneously without having any physical contact with them. Considering the duty of medical staff to take patients’ temperatures once every one or two hours, it is not difficult to imagine how helpful the functionality of their products turns out to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwanese company has been selling this temperature tracking solution to ten global markets, including countries worst hit by the coronavirus like Spain, Italy,and Germany. Interestingly, it has also been exhibited in a science museum in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September last year, iWEECARE had raised a $1M Pre-A round led by Singapore’s Verge HealthTech Fund and participated by Taiwan- and US-based Translink Capital and Darwin Venture, seeking to disrupt a market forecast to reach $1.5 billion by 2025, currently dominated by digital pen and ear thermometers, according to <a href=\"https://e27.co/taiwans-smart-thermometer-startup-iweecare-raises-us1m-for-global-expansion-20190531/\" title=\"https://e27.co/taiwans-smart-thermometer-startup-iweecare-raises-us1m-for-global-expansion-20190531/\">e27</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46230\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46230</a>&nbsp;</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-03-27 01:35:06', '2020-03-31 01:50:17', NULL),

(236, 'Is it possible to make speakers even smaller?  Acoustic design startup: beyond your imagination.', '2020-04-06', 'startup', '<p><strong>【Startup Spotlight–Sounds Great】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are provided with a wide range of social media influencers, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu, each tries their very best to attract our attention. This ongoing influence leads us to continue to watch the next video that is recommended by the algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to studies, about 78% of people are watching online videos every day in Taiwan, therefore the average time of watching is 1.6 hours per day. The thriving media industry is also bringing an increased demand for audio and visual equipment. The research institute, GHK, indicated that the first half of 2019, the global speakers and headphones market reached USD 8.7 billion. In this industry with a bright future, there is an acoustic design startup from Taiwan, that will undoubtedly blow our minds and show us the innovative technology of audio hardware design. The Taiwan-based startup - Sounds Great is founded by Mr. Chou, his classmates, and his instructor in college. Their core technology is using semiconductors and electromagnets to redesign traditional audio speakers. &nbsp;The team responded, “Long story short, we will reduce the size of traditional speakers by 99%, whereas the volume is fifty times louder than before.” Mr. Chou, the founder of Sounds Great, took out a coin from his pocket and spoke, “just imagine that we put a boombox into this coin.” &nbsp; Sounds Great and their core technology makes them stand out from a crowd, as they have also gained many acknowledgments from professionals as well as businesses. Sounds Great also got selected and awarded by the FITI innovation and startup program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【It starts with an idea of bulletproof vest】&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586066614569.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture 1: Sounds Great team picture)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chou flashed back to his college life when he was an undergraduate majoring in Chemistry in FJCU. He found a high-strength fiber material in the lab and was pondering about how to commercialize this material. The initial idea that crossed his mind was “I can use this fiber material to strengthen the bulletproof vest and it will save many soldier’s life!” As a result, Mr. Chou sent testing samples to a testing laboratory and waited for the feedback. The researcher of the testing laboratory showed them the outcome of the testing results and introduced a speaker diaphragm manufacturer, which was looking for a similar fiber material they made. Therefore, Sounds Great pivoted their bulletproof vest business idea to the game-changing acoustic material startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【Early stage - money burning to survive in the winter of R&amp;D】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very beginning of startup life was a tough time. &nbsp;As a hardware startup is not like SaaS, software, and mobile app startup. The capital is burning for the salary, rent, equipment, testing materials and so forth. It wore out their passion and entrepreneur dream of this budding startup and suddenly brought them back to reality. Mr. Chou recalled their early stage. To gain more financial aids, Mr. Chou brought their proposal to meet with various investors, apply for government subsidies, and exhibit in startup expo. &nbsp;Then, Sounds Great received a wonderful chance to be chosen in the FITI program organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology and represented Taiwan startup to receive business training in Singapore for a month. In the early stage, they adjusted and restructured their business model from the opinions by mentors in Singapore. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【External investment - the spring is around the corner】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After burning the midnight oil day by day, Sounds Great has finally proved its core technology and collects enough experiment data. Recently, Sounds Great is a partner with the semiconductor market leader to start further steps of product-market fit. Mr. Chou showed the chairs in the office and said, “we have some nice and comfortable chairs here because we seep at the office often.” Sounds Great is a member of the STARTBOARD incubation program. The first investor meetup does not have any financial support, but that was an excellent experience for them to sharpen their pitch skills and business proposal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurship is hard, especially for the first couple of years; however, Sounds Great has developed a strong foundation for their business from previous failures. The student startup–Sounds Great has transformed and became more mature in both their mentality and product. Then, their pitch and business are receiving more and more helpful feedback from different pitch competitions and investors. Sounds Great was enduring through the winter of being an underdog and finally obtained the investor’s monetary support and received a lot of public attention last year. This investment boosts the team and their product; Meanwhile, there are some global brands that see the potentiality of the innovation of audio devices. Sounds Great receives more support from the hearing-aid company as well as the Government. For this budding startup, Spring has come earlier than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【The global business strategy and risk management】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586066602443.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture 2: Mr. Chou was explaining their core technology to the patent consultants)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a whiteboard with a clear roadmap of business strategy and patent portfolio at Sounds Great’s office. The demand for home theatre and smart home devices&nbsp;has&nbsp;increased significantly and the acoustics development has been technologically stagnant for years. Sounds Great is ready to take action to make good use of their game-changing audio technology, either having their brand or becoming the OEM partner of audio equipment companies. Besides US and European markets, Sounds Great is also planning to strategically expand their business in Singapore and Vietnam, and arrange for the Southeast Asia market. During the interview, Sounds Great would like to recruit talented engineers specialized in semiconductor, acoustic devices, and product development. If you are the one with the desired background, Sounds Great welcome you to join this high-potential startup to bring the world a better audio experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CMvU8pnafs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CMvU8pnafs</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written by Ching-Yen Lin, Project Manager at STARTBOARD\r\n	<br>Edited by Jeannette Lealofi</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-05 06:02:41', '2023-09-25 14:30:35', NULL),

He told Business Next that he knew he wanted to come back, so after working for ridesharing company Lyft for two years, he boarded a plane that crosses the Pacific ocean and soon found himself re-exploring the Taiwanese capital by bicycle -- an integral part of the city’s public transport system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garcia praised Taipei for its developed infrastructure: subway and bus services are reliable and affordable, and “you can get anywhere in Taipei safely on a bike,” he said. “I want to live in a city where I can bike everywhere.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2009, the city of Taipei has been working with local manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.giantcyclingworld.com/\" title=\"https://www.giantcyclingworld.com/\">Giant</a> to offer a public bicycle rental service called Youbike; there are 13,000+ bicycles served by 400+ docking stations, many of which are outside subway stations.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586248586358.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-07/img-1563342447-18894@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-07/img-1563342447-18894@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-07/img-1563342447-18894@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"google youbike\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Bike share network in Taipei / Photograph : Google Maps, YouBike App</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>He believes it makes the city an international hub for talent. “If people want to live here, it’s so easy to just come here,” he said. In Taipei, one can rely on public transport without investing in a car or bike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a person who enjoys walking, he also likes the walkability of the city. “Convenience stores and restaurants are within walking distance,” he said. “I don’t need to leave my area to go to the gym, doctor, pharmacy, [and so on.]” By contrast, in typical American cities, residents tend to spend some hours every day on travelling to and from different places, and there’s no way to reduce the amount of time spent on these trips unless they move to the downtown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in the mobility sector, Garcia said he has been interested in “expanding transportation options that are sustainable and affordable.” During his two years at Lyft, he helped launch the bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area and build 400+ bike stations. Now in Taipei, he told Business Next that he hopes to help other cities develop a transportation system of the same quality. “I want to live in a place that lives the values that I\'m trying to help other cities have,” he explained, as the founder of transportation consulting firm <a href=\"https://taipeiurbanism.com/\" title=\"https://taipeiurbanism.com\">Taipei Urbanism</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>As a gold card holder</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched two years ago, the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is part of a government initiative to attract highly-skilled foreign talent to Taiwan. The government has identified several key areas, under which qualified foreigners can apply for the Gold Card, like Science &amp; Technology, Economy, Finance, among others. They will be assessed under a set of specific requirements defined by the corresponding government agencies (such as the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and Ministry of Economic Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The card, valid for up to three years, puts together four crucial documents for foreigners to live and work in Taiwan: resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC; the card which proves the holder’s right to legally reside in Taiwan), multiple entry permit, and open work permit (it allows the holder to work for any employer(s) in Taiwan).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garcia applied under the category of Economy and has just recently received his gold card. He said it’s the simplest option as all he needed to do is to verify that his income was above a certain threshold last year, though he hopes submitting the W-2 form that comes out once a year isn’t the only way to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The card ensures him a stable home and health insurance in Taiwan for three years, and he doesn’t need to be sponsored for a regular employment visa by working for a local company. The open work permit gives him full flexibility to work on his project or for a Taiwanese company and any transition will be seamless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describing his mindset as “Asian,” he applauded that the gold card allows him to develop his business at a slower pace. “I can create company [in Taiwan] when I’m confident enough, when there’s enough clients, [and] when I can give someone a stable job,” he explained. In his hometown California, most companies, like Uber, don’t make a single cent for years, and “everyone thinks that\'s ok.” However, he believes only revenue pushes his business forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taipei Urbanism, he helps mobility companies from the US and Europe complete their proposal for transportation projects to be submitted to the government. He has also noticed a great interest in East and Southeast Asia from several clients. “I submit the work in a way that’s easy to look at for them to make a decision or get to the next step of the project,” he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, he now works as a volunteer in the city government of Taipei; this allows him to learn from the local community and later apply the lessons to his work. Also, due to the nature of the industry he works in, it’s valuable for him to be close to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, he plans to create a Taiwanese branch for his company, which should make it easier for him to compete for government grants, for example, on energy transition and smart mobility. He’s also open to working with Taiwanese companies -- that are developing mobility solutions or manufacturing hardware products -- and helping them go global.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s so much potential for Taiwan to be a big player in electric trams, buses, and batteries,” he said. For example, the southern city of Kaohsiung boasts the world’s first wire-free light rail system in which trams charge their batteries for around ten seconds at each stop to make it to the next. Electric buses are also <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014%20%22https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014\" title=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014 \">becoming more and more common</a> on the streets of Taiwan.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586248586713.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2018-05/img-1527750869-55007@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2018-05/img-1527750869-55007@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2018-05/img-1527750869-55007@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Taipei Metro\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Taipei Metro / Photogaph :&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2010_07_21570_6839_Da%27an_District,_Taipei,_Heping_Road,_Fuxing_Road,_Taipei_Metro_Muzha_Line,_Viaducts,_Composite_bridges,_Taiwan.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">wikimedia</a></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>With 24 years of experience of managing metro system, he said, Taiwan should be able to help developing countries in Southeast Asia build and maintain a reliable and efficient system, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46294\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46294</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-07 08:39:33', '2020-04-07 08:45:05', NULL),

Probably yes, and this is reasonable. We simply can’t afford to verify all the information we have access to. Even if we want to, it’s extremely difficult if not impossible for us to do so -- because there’s virtually no way to trace the source of, say, a picture or video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, most of us are aware that we live in an era of fake news. With malicious intent or not, individuals, organizations, and even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/\" title=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/\">governments</a> are spreading misinformation to manipulate public opinion over social media platforms and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Luk_Anikos/status/1064107115835531264\" title=\"https://twitter.com/Luk_Anikos/status/1064107115835531264\">a photo</a> of a scene at the \"Je Suis Charlie\" demonstration in 2015 was shared as evidence of the Yellow Vests taking to the streets to protest against a surge in oil price. Also, a video Donald Trump tweeted in which some thousands of protesters chant his name as they dodge tear gas in Paris turns out to be <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/08/falling-les-fake-news-trump-spreads-lie-french-protesters-chant-name/\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/12/08/falling-les-fake-news-trump-spreads-lie-french-protesters-chant-name/\">a lie</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under such circumstances, it’s not surprising to see a <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php\" title=\"https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php\">lack of trust</a> in media outlets around the world. Taiwan startup Numbers is launched in 2019 to tackle this issue. With blockchain, the team develops an app named Numbers Capture that is able to ensure the integrity of a digital image over its life cycle. “We’d like to rebuild people’s trust toward data,” the team told Business Next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a video conference, <a href=\"https://numbersprotocol.io/\" title=\"https://numbersprotocol.io/\">Numbers</a> team explained that the issue of trust has two aspects. From the perspective of the person who takes a picture (data producer), whether a random individual or journalist, they would not know if their photo is copied, misused, or edited and then re-published as it circulates on the Internet. Meanwhile, for those who use a picture (data consumer), there’s no guarantee that it’s the exact version produced by the original photographer instead of a photoshopped version.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586828689641.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1586341318-43219@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1586341318-43219@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1586341318-43219@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Numbers Capture\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Numbers Capture Photograph : Numbers</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for data to be trustworthy, it needs to be traceable, and for Numbers, this means that to “capture its source” and record it on the blockchain. Whenever a user takes a picture with their phone, the Numbers Capture app will hash its metadata (like when, where, how, and with what type of device the picture is taken) and other relevant data (like weather and temperature) in order to generate a digital footprint. It will later be encrypted and uploaded to the blockchain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, the picture itself will be encrypted and stored on a distributed file system (InterPlanetary File System; IPFS); however, Numbers also offers the option for their clients to store their pictures on a private cloud, in case some shy away from keeping their data in a decentralized system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A scenario for a user to utilize the app is when they provide a picture to news sites, co-founder Sophia Yen told Business Next. They will be able to prove that their material isn’t tampered with by granting access permission to the digital evidence previously recorded on the blockchain. In addition, an AI algorithm is implemented to help news sites verify the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, with Numbers’s service, a user can ensure their evidence is sufficiently reliable to be admitted at trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Yen pointed out one of the advantages of their product is that it’s more than a mobile app. Instead, it integrates with some Canon cameras so that photos taken with them can be rendered traceable, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup’s B2B model involves providing SDK for image source capturing, integrating the app with an existing storage system, and maintaining the entire system that allows users to record data and verify its integrity; they also plan to provide the service to end users like photographers, bloggers and Youtubers, who will be charged based on the number of pictures they take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are ourselves data producers,” Mr. Yen said. “It’s vital that we know who uses our data and how it’s used.” She also recognized the necessity of educating the general public about the issue of data ownership and verifiability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, Numbers has been offering their service to international news sites (in the US and Europe), NGOs, war correspondents, and independent photographers. Their partners include hTC Exodus and Binance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Yen told us the startup has taken the first step in combating fake news by making data traceable and verifiable, and the next step is to build a platform for users to trade and monetize their personal data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46268\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46268</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-14 01:45:47', '2020-04-14 01:45:47', NULL),

It will be available for download by the end of Q2, 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Earlier, Midas Labs has raised a seed round led by <a href=\"https://proof.fund/\" title=\"https://proof.fund/\">Proof of Capital</a>, a blockchain-focused venture capital fund managed by Phil Chen, who leads the Exodus team for HTC as the Decentralized Chief Officer.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The executive said the the dominance of giant mining pools threatens the crypto world. They pour a huge amount of computing power into the network so as to enjoy a greater probability to be given the opportunity to add a block into the chain and reap the rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To him, making crypto mining accessible for everyone is the most effective way to change the status quo. By making the process cost-efficient, he believes the DeMiner app incentivizes individual miners to help decentralize the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Jri Lee, founder and CEO of Midas Labs and a professor at National Taiwan University said today, a typical laptop consumes around 65W of electricity -- which costs $0.16 -- to mine $0.04 worth of Monero per day, and the app is able to cut the cost by at least 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based in Taiwan, Midas Labs is an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design company specializing in blockchain mining and associated applications. Its unique “super hash engine” provides the world’s first re-programmable mining ASIC, a chip that supports dozens of hash algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proof of Capital said it’s excited to work with the Midas Labs team, whose members are experienced experts in the IC industry.

However, he told Business Next that looking back at the years, he has never thought about his title of entrepreneur. “You are an entrepreneur once you take action,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a new 30 under 30 honoree, this young entrepreneur shared with Business Next his experience of starting a business in the prime of his life. His words have been slightly edited for brevity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spending your youth running a startup, what have you sacrificed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I\'ve learned so much from the experience that I don\'t think I\'ve sacrificed anything for it.

Plus, the startup allows me to build wealth and gain a sense of accomplishment and mission. It’s hard to say I’ve made any sacrifice.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs in their twenties?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Starting a company comes with a lot of pressure. It’s difficult to distinguish whether it’s due to a lack of experience.

I’m optimistic about young entrepreneurs, who are able to learn fast and as blank slates.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>During these years running a startup, have you thought about giving up? What makes you who you are today?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yes, I’ve thought about giving up. At the lowest point of my life, I turned to biographies of CEOs and founders of great companies, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, and realized that they have all been through the same time in their life. I also learned that you need to face your fears in order to grow, and after the biggest difficulty comes the biggest breakthrough in life.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"There are two reasons why I didn’t give up. First, I have a big dream to achieve. Also, I’ve received support from so many people. They’ve been with me through good and bad times and I hope to give back someday.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you could make the decision again, would you choose to start your journey as an entrepreneur in the second year of university?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"If I had the chance, I would not only make the same decision but start the journey as early as possible. However, I normally don’t encourage students to start their own business. A true entrepreneur is one who doesn’t give up even if the world tells them to.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is work–life balance for you as an entrepreneur?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I’ve never tried to achieve work-life balance since balance means separation to me. Every life experience helps me make better decisions at work. Plus, it’s hard for me not to think about work when I’m off work.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-16 01:33:32', '2020-04-16 01:34:44', NULL),

(247, 'iCHEF, KGI Bank team up to support small restaurants in light of COVID-19', '2020-04-20', 'Startup News', '<p>As restaurant owners struggle to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, a restaurant point-of-sale (POS) service provider has rolled out several plans to offer support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, Taiwan-based restaurant tech startup <a href=\"https://www.ichefpos.com/\" title=\"https://www.ichefpos.com/\">iCHEF</a> announced <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46338\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46338\">collaboration with KGI Bank</a>, one of the many banks who apply for the relief loans offered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on behalf of businesses who see a 15% decline in revenue for two consecutive months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, over the four-day holiday in early April, revenue for restaurants in five major municipalities has declined by 23%, according to <a href=\"https://www.foodnext.net/news/newstrack/paper/5111437815\" title=\"https://www.foodnext.net/news/newstrack/paper/5111437815\">foodnext</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For iCHEF, the collaboration entails giving the bank access to the data on its platform. Then, KGI Bank is able to examine the financial health of the restaurants using iCHEF\'s POS device and help them apply for the government lending program without requesting them to submit documents that prove a negative growth in revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The streamlined process should benefit those who suffer less severe decline in revenue and thus aren’t qualified as a beneficiary of the coronavirus relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restaurants with NT$5M annual revenue can now submit loan application to KGI Bank directly through iCHEF’s system and, if approved, receive a three-year emergency installment loan <a href=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844\" title=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844\">worth up to NT$1M</a> within five days. Also, personal loans will soon be available to restaurant owners making $200k revenue every month; they can expect to receive up to NT$450k at a preferable interest rate within three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KGI Bank estimates that these two plans should help 5,000 and 6,000 restaurants, respectively, <a href=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844\" title=\"https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844\">Economy Daily News</a> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We know it’s been a tough time for small restaurant owners,” said iCHEF co-founder Ken Chen. “Therefore, we not only hope to make technology accessible to them but provide loan programs that will help them survive.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iCHEF develops a POS system to help restaurant owners increase their revenue through data analytics. Founded in 2012, it has provided the service more than 6,000 restaurants around Asia, in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwanese company usually provides an iPad for restaurant owners and charges a fixed fee (US$100/month) for access to its data analytics platform. However, in response to the crisis faced by restaurant owners, iCHEF has rolled out a new pricing model where users are charged based on how heavily they use its service every month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the company has waived the monthly subscription fee for around 60,000 small restaurants in Taiwan and Hong Kong. This measure applies to new clients, too.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1587348571700.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1587117345-28174@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1587117345-28174@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-04/img-1587117345-28174@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"iCHEF &amp; Uber Eats\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>iCHEF integrates Uber Eats with its POS system. / Photograph : iCHEF</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>As more and more customers <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-food-delivery-is-300-times-more-popular-vs-a-month-ago-according-to-yelp-data-182100853.html\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-food-delivery-is-300-times-more-popular-vs-a-month-ago-according-to-yelp-data-182100853.html\">shift to ordering their food online</a>, iCHEF has also integrated its POS system with Uber Eats, allowing restaurants to take and process dine-in, takeout, and delivery orders with the same device and thus improving efficiency in food preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s one of the company’s “pre-emptive measures” to help restaurants weather the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Chen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46343\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46343</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-20 02:13:24', '2020-04-20 06:01:14', NULL),

In many parts of the world, however, governments are struggling to flatten the curve, keeping people at home or staying away from each other in public spaces. As these measures harm the economy, they are also considering easing the lockdown, but it remains a question if they can prevent a second wave of infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To respond to these challenges, Prof. Wang raised a series of questions: “how much viral load matters for infectivity, how many different types of tests are out there, and how do we do contact tracing and follow-up care at a massive scale now.” It’s only from knowing the answers to these questions can we start to think about solutions, or “find problems worth solving.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, having a clear picture about the wide range of existing test kits, one may go about comparing their levels of sensitivity, specificity, and costs and make testing more accurate and efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a professor at the School of Medicine, he also called for a better understanding of the biology of the virus disease and its symptoms to be able to produce therapeutics and vaccines. “Are you prevent the binding of the virus [to the cell], disrupt the replication of the virus, or prevent the virus from going out of the cell?” These are all opportunities to tap into, he said, as the world works on the most urgently needed solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, he believes it’s most valuable now to “develop an integrated tech package for contact tracing and follow up care” for those seeking solutions to do “plug and play,” and come up with strategies to scale and deliver them to the customers. Ultimately, he expects an “integrated and secure platform” that could put together various solutions that make it to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, as mitigation measures, like lockdown and social distancing, hit the most vulnerable in the society, Prof. Wang also encouraged entrepreneurs come in and offer solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Taiwan makes it</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Techstars’s pre-event has attracted a great number of non-Taiwanese, who are interested to learn about the nation’s success in containing the virus and keeping the economy running. Mr. Chen, the head of the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology (MOST), explained that this is because Taiwan is well-prepared for an epidemic, proactive in tackling the virus, and quick to adapt new technologies, including the monitoring system described as <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3912429\" title=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3912429\">digital fence</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His ministry, notably, has been funding over 300 science labs all around the island since the SARS pandemic, and the discussion on the novel coronavirus has started among medical experts and doctors way before the first case of infection was confirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More broadly, Taiwan is no stranger to disasters, he said. Frequently hit by earthquakes, typhoons, and flooding, Taiwanese citizens are used to taking action in an emergency, such as following <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004030007\" title=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004030007\">orders to wear a mask on public transport</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With flexible regulations in disaster management, the government is also able to respond timely to a sudden crisis; for example, in early April, when visitors were flocking to several tourist attractions during the holiday, the Center for Disaster Reduction under MOST sent a text alert to their phone, asking them to wear a mask and keep distance with other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the few countries in the world where the situation is contained, Prof. Wang said there is great opportunity for Taiwan to export its solutions to help developing countries and allies weather the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46368\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46368</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-04-27 01:22:18', '2020-04-27 01:22:18', NULL),

In Taiwan, for example, CVC business units and firms have participated in 52% of all the deals made for the past five years, according to <a href=\"https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/\" title=\"https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/\">Taiwania Capital</a>’s report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based in San Francisco Bay Area, <a href=\"https://msad.vc/\" title=\"https://msad.vc/\">MS&amp;AD Ventures</a> is a CVC firm of MS&amp;AD Insurance Group Holdings, a Japanese insurance company that operates in 47 countries around the world. With 120M fund under management, the firm invests in early-stage startup companies across continents and industry verticals, from fintech, AI, to cybersecurity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many CVC investors shy away from backing young startups, MS&amp;AD Ventures have had 32 companies in portfolio and seeks to invest more; these companies hail from the US, Germany, Israel, Singapore, and so on. To explain their strategy, Tiffine Wang, partner for the CVC firm, told Business Next that they bet on “what’s going to happen in three to seven years from now.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their parent company is aware that innovation shouldn’t only be incremental -- a series of minor improvements to existing products -- but also disruptive. “I invest in a company I think is going to kill my portfolio company,” she chuckled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MS&amp;AD Ventures has a team of business development leads that source technologies to be implement into business units in the next six to twelve months. On the investment side, the decision making sits with the three partners, who focuses on disruptive models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just one of the many features that make Ms. Wang’s firm unconventional. Others include the ability to make an investment decision within two weeks, though it usually entails a series of evaluations and negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our team, especially from the investment side, is known for being agile,” she said. “We stand on top of things about moving fast, and that’s what we pride ourselves on doing because we want to be mindful of how entrepreneurs are treated.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandemic has slightly slowed down the process, but she said it’s because they have been helping portfolio companies revamp their plan to ensure they have enough cash runway of 12 to 18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She believes now it’s a great time for investors to bet on early stage startups, as they may focus on building a product in the time of economic downturn and be ready to launch it when the crisis comes under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>We want them to come to us when something is wrong</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Like her other partners, Ms. Wang had been working with entrepreneurs for years before moving into the VC space. She has built incubator and accelerator programs to help talent with technical background start their own business, including the <a href=\"https://alchemistaccelerator.com/\" title=\"https://alchemistaccelerator.com/\">Alchemist Accelerator</a>, and most recently, worked for Singaporean holdings company Singtel on innovation and venture investment.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1588554968013.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1588349985-39046@900.jpeg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1588349985-39046@900.jpeg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1588349985-39046@900.jpeg 900w\" title=\"Image(1)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Tiffine Wang, Partner at MS&amp;AD Ventures / Photograph : <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/MS&amp;AD%20Ventures\" target=\"_blank\">Tiffine Wang/MS&amp;AD Ventures</a></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of their experience, she said they try to be respectful and responsive to entrepreneurs. “We want them to come to us when something is wrong...because we can help them manage it,” Ms. Wang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With educational background in psychology, she has a unique perspective about how to coach startups and entrepreneurs. “As a case manager, you don’t go in there with an idea about what this person is gonna say or do,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She and her team lead and guide entrepreneurs to grow and expand globally -- without telling them explicitly how to achieve it. Instead, they aim to be a resource for their entrepreneurs, introducing them to other VCs, customers, and a “holistic perspective” about how to run a global business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, she said, most problems in a startup team are people problems; this is, again where her knowledge in psychology comes in handy. She described what she would do for them as a “massage.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of investment strategy, Ms. Wang explained that her team tends to follow instead of leading a deal -- because they try to avoid sending signals to other companies. “We don’t want to say this company is our company and no one else can work with them.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many CVCs who may prefer exclusive deals, she said her team seeks to be part of the ecosystem and open up as many new opportunities for their companies as possible. However, it’s still possible that they lead a funding round if their relationship with the startup team “clicks.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"34402\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"34402\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Growing presence in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As she manages portfolio companies spread all over the world, Ms. Wang has been visiting Taiwan in search of VCs to co-invest with. At the moment, she said she’s still learning from the ecosystem from Taiwanese VCs and some others from Singapore who having been talking about Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside traditional CVCs, there are several younger emerging managers in Taiwan that are operating more like a global VC like her, and this is a great opportunity for the country if their global perspective turns into part of its culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s not about Taiwan become Silicon Valley or Israel, but about Taiwan becoming fully Taiwan,” she said. “You have to take all the things you’ve learned from all over the world and turn it into the Taiwan DNA and make that successful.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Wang took herself as an example of continuous learning: it’s only spending enough time at Singtel did she become well-versed in the telecom industry. She encouraged Taiwanese founders to go and learn from the companies in the ecosystem where their industry is thriving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, “if you’re building a security company, it’s wise to spend some time in Israel, meeting the entrepreneurs who are part of the ecosystem,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, she stressed that Taiwan should keep working on what it’s been good at, such as healthcare and hardware design, and “do it in a way that no one else can do it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p><strong>“I don\'t want to invest in the Taiwanese version of Uber,” she asserted. “I want to invest in something I can only find in Taiwan, so the world comes to Taiwan to find this thing.”</strong></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Wang believes Taiwan has the potential to stand out on the world stage, but founders have to be committed to building technologies that can scale globally. With a great talent pool, Taiwan should dare to take bigger risks and go after big ideas, she concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46394\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46394</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-04 01:17:52', '2020-05-04 01:18:22', NULL),

The startup, notably, has recently released <a href=\"https://creepts.cartesi.io/en/\" title=\"https://creepts.cartesi.io/en/\">Creepts</a>, an app they claim to be the first fully decentralized game on Linux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same year, Mirabella also met Kevin Yen of <a href=\"https://biggo.com.tw/\" title=\"https://biggo.com.tw/\">BigGo</a>, CEO of a MOX portfolio company that he managed. In January 2020, BigGo’s search engine, which allows customers to compare prices of products from various sellers and enjoy cashback rewards, is <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/TW\" title=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/TW\">ranked as the 31th most visited website in Taiwan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he would make phone calls with Yen every week to discuss business strategies, and it was him who advised the CEO to break new ground by adding cash back feature to his price comparison website. This proved to be a success, with around two millions users in Taiwan now benefiting from this service every month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t surprising that Yen later offered him to work as the Chief Strategy Officer for BigGo. “He told me that ‘we need someone that does what you do,’” Mirabella recalled. In fact, the opportunity to transfer to a new position couldn’t have come more timely, as he had been struggling to contribute to the startup he co-founded in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the day he came on board, the Taiwanese company has been embracing a series of changes -- streamlining operations to expand to as many countries as possible, he said. The company has gained traction in Japan and Thailand, and now, they’re moving on to Indonesia and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are one of the few consumer-facing software companies going global from Taiwan,” he claimed, “and we are proud of that.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As COVID-19 forces people to stay at home and shop online, BigGo has seen the number of its monthly users grow from 13 to 14.3M, Mirabella said. With greater efforts to expand into new markets, the company expects to “double or even triple the number.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides growth, he is also keen on turning BigGo into a global company. He has been offering training sessions for employees in English and most recently, promoting a shift to remote work to attract foreign talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"49904\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"49904\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Encounter with a cohesive community for entrepreneurs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mirabella came to Taiwan four years ago and since then, has been active in the startup space. He is also one of the early applicants for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, a government initiative to attract highly-skilled foreign talent to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The card, valid for up to three years, puts together four crucial documents for foreigners to live and work in Taiwan: resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC; the card which proves the holder’s right to legally reside in Taiwan), multiple entry permit, and open work permit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government has identified several key areas, under which qualified foreigners can apply for the Gold Card, like Science &amp; Technology, Economy, Finance, among others. They will be assessed under a set of specific requirements defined by the corresponding government agencies (such as the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and Ministry of Economic Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With experience of running a tech startup and endorsement from MOX and Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA), Mirabella said it wasn’t difficult for him to “prove that his skills benefit Taiwan” and apply for the gold card under the category of Technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He described the startup community in Taiwan as “small but cohesive.” Being part of the community means receiving support from not only organizations like TTA but effectively, everyone, he said. This is also the reason why he believes it may be easier to apply for the card from Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, he appreciates the National Development Council (NDC)’s efforts in building up a community for Gold Card holders by organizing meetups on a regular basis, where they share their experience of living and working in Taiwan and have direct conversation with policy makers. It’s also nice to meet people from various backgrounds, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as an entrepreneur, he believes there are several issues that Taiwan should work on to enable the startup ecosystem to thrive. For example, the government should simplify the process of opening a company to attract foreign startups to come to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they come to Taiwan in great numbers, he said, then investors will start to see Taiwan and the gap of early stage funding can possibly be filled. “It’s a chicken-egg problem.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan has the potential to become a international hub for talent and startups, and it has been working toward unleashing it. Initiatives like the Taiwan Employment Gold Card and <a href=\"https://ltl-taiwan.com/taiwan-entrepreneur-visa/\" title=\"https://ltl-taiwan.com/taiwan-entrepreneur-visa/\">Entrepreneur Visa</a> are both part of the efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At international startup events, I feel like I represent not only my company but Taiwan,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked why he decided to settle down in Taiwan, he said he usually turns the question around and asks “Why not Taiwan.” Having stayed in Taiwan for four years, he now plans to stay for an indefinite period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46396\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46396</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-07 07:38:24', '2020-05-07 07:40:02', NULL),

All researchers are eligible to apply for free access as long as their research is compliant with regulations and institutional policies. Several scientists from UC San Diego and Harvard University have already been using this database for COVID-19 research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the same data, Neo also helps families monitor their health in real time. Based in Taipei, Peng said the system enables him to track the health of his family members living in the US at any time without making phone calls. To be precise, it analyzes the data and sends signals when a family member is sick or possibly infected with COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, if the pattern how a person’s blood oxygen drops is similar to that of other people with the virus, then it’s sufficient to say he/she is infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, the temperature gun widely used to screen for the coronavirus is highly unreliable, he said. “The mass majority of people who have a fever don’t have COVID-19.” By launching Neo, his team hopes to create new standards to detect the infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a month, 200 families from 15 countries have signed up for early access of the service. It will be open to everyone by the end of the next week (May 15).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They may use compatible devices, including Garmin wristbands and smartwatches and Polar heart rate sensors, or manually input their data into the system for this service. Invalid data will be flagged for removal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Neo, PhysioQ won the first prize earlier last week in the <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46382\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46382\">Global Online Startup Weekend in Taipei</a>, a 54-hour hackathon event where entrepreneurs and innovators came together to tackle the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46421\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46421</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-08 03:04:59', '2020-05-08 03:06:53', NULL),

After this structural change, the group says it aims to focus entirely on its live streaming business, which accounts for 91.4% of the overall revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CEO Joseph Phua says what M17 provides is “a virtual stage for performers to explore what is possible both artistically and financially.\" That is, it allows them to \"showcase their talent and interact directly with fans everywhere in real-time” to receive rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup now holds 60% share in the live streaming market in Taiwan and Japan, according to a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/m17-entertainment-limited-announces-us26-5-million-in-series-d-funding-301056388.html\" title=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/m17-entertainment-limited-announces-us26-5-million-in-series-d-funding-301056388.html\">press statement</a>. In Japan, it claims to be the largest “pure-play” video live streaming company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, M17 <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/m17-acquires-meme-live\" title=\"https://www.techinasia.com/m17-acquires-meme-live\">acquired Meme Live</a>, a live streaming platform focusing on APAC markets, including India and Southeast Asia, to bring its market share in the Asian live streaming space to 60%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impressed by its growing dominance in Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, Tam Hock Chuan, managing director of Vertex Growth, says his firm believes that M17 is well prepared for the next phase of growth with a \"unique value proposition and battle-hardened management team.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a strong presence in Asia, M17 plans to expand into the US and emerging markets, including the Middle East, to include more artists and viewers into its ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As on-demand viewing is gaining traction, M17 turns the opportunity into a commercial success. As Jeff Chang, managing director of Vertex Growth, describes, the startup is “a beneficiary from the accelerating shift towards building a digital economy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past few months, the startup says it has seen a significant growth in the number of artists and viewers, as the coronavirus pandemic leads to an increased consumption of digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46435\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46435</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-15 05:56:53', '2020-05-15 05:56:53', NULL),

It trains muscles around the eyes and has been proved to significantly improve eyesight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, he has been on a mission to promote it to the people of Taiwan, who suffer from one of the highest rates of retinal detachment in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he helps people improve their vision at <a href=\"https://yogacharles.com/?fbclid=IwAR0axeeMlk_gLQkR_fjnnqMAj6F-s_5I4aA5TXiGRzx7CKSoDUDk9TYI7tM\" title=\"https://yogacharles.com/?fbclid=IwAR0axeeMlk_gLQkR_fjnnqMAj6F-s_5I4aA5TXiGRzx7CKSoDUDk9TYI7tM\">Yoga Charles</a>, Du also seeks to achieve personal growth in multiple dimensions -- physically, intellectually, spiritually, and etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“To me, growth is change, which means ‘to be better today than I was yesterday,’” he explains. “I feel like right now Taiwan is the best place for my growth.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Life as digital nomad</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before leaving his hometown, Du has led a successful career as a product manager: he has developed NASA’s first app, worked on consumer products for Apple, and co-founded carsharing unicorn Getaround, where he helped with the company’s first prototype.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To him, the experience of working for big companies has been valuable. “It made me efficient and good at certain skills,” he says. “There’s also a lot of really smart people that you can learn from.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he understands that he eventually needs to grow his own business if he ever wants to fully focus on personal growth, instead of working for a company, which aims to bring values to the shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, companies are laying off their workforce to stay afloat, and this is the time when people realize their jobs aren’t as secure as they may expect, he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, Du left his career behind and started to travel around the world. He has become a digital nomad, who works from everywhere from Prague to Taipei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“To grow naturally, I have to have the freedom to change my environment,” he says. “If I can find an environment that grows me in the area that I want, then all I have to do is to be inside it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a clear vision, a person knows where to go and grow themselves, he says. However, in absence of such vision, they have to expose themselves to various experiences first.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"215454\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"215454\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Experience stimulates growth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Du says he has experienced a high rate of growth during a burning man event, a weeklong festival where tens of thousands of people gather in the Nevada desert to create a temporary community.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1590628727364.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1590559432-43208@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1590559432-43208@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-05/img-1590559432-43208@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"burning-man\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>The Burning Man festival culminates in the symbolic burning of a huge wooden effigy (in the center). / Photograph : Pixabay</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>In this period of fast growth, “new ideas come to us and we get transformed in a way,” he tells Business Next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was his first time to experience what he calls “growth spurts\" and also the moment he realized that he needs to lead a location and time location independent career to experience different environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>“If you live in one place doing one thing, you’re only doing linear growth,” he says. “But if you’re placed in a different environment, you have the potential to do exponential growth.”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past few years, he would move to a new location every month and later every season, and now, he\'s in Taiwan, where he discovered what he\'s willing to devote his life to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"By coming to Taiwan, I came across eye yoga, and that’s the effect of traveling,\" he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing on his experience, Du encourages them to travel outside Taiwan and live in a different country to truly experience what wouldn’t be possible in Taiwan. “If they want to be global, they should go and experience it,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, he also suggests that founders take their entire workforce to live in a foreign country in order to broaden their horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Develop a feeling of truth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of experience, personal growth involves self-reflection. That is, after being placed in and learning from a new environment, a person has to reflect on the experience to “toss out what’s not pertinent to their life,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Du describes this process as a “cycle of expansion and condensation,” and it’s only after going through a series of these cycles can a person pick up what they feel true and lead their life with a clear vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people make life decisions based on logic, so they may weigh the pros and cons on paper before doing so. “But in the end, your heart is telling you something,” he says. “A lot people ignore their feeling and listen to their parents and the society, and the truth becomes a little hazy.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, this feeling of truth translates into “a faith in the universe,” he says. “You feel you’re going to the right direction and the universe rewards you, and you ask yourself: ‘what are the chances that this has happened to me right now.’”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, such feeling is also a source of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an award-winning product manager, he says to be the best product person isn’t to be data driven -- but data informed. In other words, they don’t make decisions based on what data tell them; instead, they make decisions and see how data backs them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He takes Steve Jobs as an example. The innovative mind behind Apple draws a lot of truths from his feelings, and the data prove to be supporting them, he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are so many things we experience that we know are true, but it’s hard to find data to justify they’re true,” he says. Du, therefore, suggests that we “lead more with the heart, less with the mind.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46488\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46488</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-28 01:20:53', '2020-05-28 01:22:37', NULL),

He regards the app as a great addition to make sure the lending platform is 100% secure and trustworthy for lenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How it works</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the app installed and their identity verified, a Konek user -- or agent, as Susanto calls them -- will match with a borrower who fails to repay the loan on time and pay a visit to their place of residence to demand payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PinjamWinWin’s lending app collects user data, including home address, and every borrower has to grant the app access to their location data. Since it shares the data with Konek via backend services, an agent will only match with those who are physically close to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The borrower will be notified when an agent is on their way to visit them, Susanto explains. That’s why there are cases where borrowers repay their loan before someone knocks on their door, or even when they see the notification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On average, a visit takes around three to five minutes and ends with the two people taking a selfie to prove the visit has taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In a broader sense, Susanto says sending people to visit the borrowers is a way to “ensure they stay connected with the lending platform.”</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PinjamWinWin also tasks Konek users with meeting new borrowers face-to-face to verify their identity or to learn the reasons why they uninstall the lending app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susanto says his startup is the first in the world to roll out such service and is actively looking for new gig workers based in major Indonesian cities, including the capital Jakarta, where most of its funds are disbursed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"3209611\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"3209610\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Promote loans for eveyone</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, PinjamWinWin <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45338\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45338\">was accepted into Mobile Only Accelerator (MOX)</a>, a Taiwan-based accelerator that focuses on emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and South Asia.

She points out that on Shopline’s platform, more than 40% of these online sellers have received orders from overseas, despite their focus on the Taiwan market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2013, the Hong Kong-based company builds an e-commerce platform helping retailers launch and manage their online shops. It announces expansion into Taiwan in 2015 and since then has helped more than 120 thousand local retailers start their online business, including Taiwanese tea brand Jing Sheng Yu, skincare brand Greenvines, and accessory brand Lucy’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopline’s collaboration with 7-Eleven makes it easier for online sellers to ship their products abroad. What they need to do is to print out a special label from the store management system, paste it on the product, and send the product to 7-Eleven’s distribution center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the product is on its way to the aforementioned three destinations, the seller is able to track the shipment and enhance logistical efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides 7-Eleven stores, Shopline says it also gives shoppers the option to pick up their orders at a number of coffee shops, drugstores, and banks, with which it has signed partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By bringing convenience to shoppers, Lau says her company helps encourage spending on products from Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with 7-Eleven is part of Shopline’s wider effort to help the online retailers on its platform sell their products internationally, especially to Southeast Asia, a market that sees a rapid growth in e-commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research and Google <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/google_export_tw/go_global_whitepaper_tw_2019/\" title=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/google_export_tw/go_global_whitepaper_tw_2019/\">forecast</a> that the size of the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia will grow from $23 billion in 2018 to $102 billion in 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopline says it aims to build a robust ecosystem for cross-border e-commerce for retailers by expanding its partner network in logistics, payment, warehousing, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company now has offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46520\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46520</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-06-05 01:37:11', '2020-06-05 01:37:11', NULL),

(273, 'FreightTech startup BlueX helps ocean carriers like Evergreen Marine go digital', '2020-06-10', '', '<p>As the coronavirus pandemic forces companies to embrace digital transformation, a Taiwan-based startup is helping the ocean shipping industry take the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, more than 90% of the freight is <a href=\"https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/freight-forwarding/ocean-freight/\" title=\"https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/freight-forwarding/ocean-freight/\">shipped via ocean</a>. Massive in size, the industry has a great potential for profitability; however, due to the low level of digitization, marine carriers have been mired in the swamp of low return on invested capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If you think about how a shipper books a container to move from point A to B, it’s done largely the same way as it has been done over the last 20 years,” Sean O’Malley, co-founder and CEO of BlueX, tells Business Next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The communication between the shipper and carrier usually involves a great deal of paperwork, phone calls, and emails, and takes up to two days. However, “that’s just to get your ticket to get a container onto the boat,” he says. After the booking, shippers still need to work with providers of other logistics services, from financing to warehousing, to send the goods to the right destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. O’Malley, therefore, co-founded <a href=\"https://www.bluextrade.com/\" title=\"https://www.bluextrade.com/\">BlueX</a> two years ago to connect the carrier and their shippers with an “open freight marketplace” and serve the latter by leading them to complete everything they need in order to ship their freight internationally, free of hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the time of COVID-19, companies are realizing the necessity of digitizing their business and going paper-free, and BlueX has been seeing interests from carriers as well. “This is how the future needs to work,” Mr. O’Malley says.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Agoda of FreightTech</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup found inspiration in the airline industry that has been actively digitizing for the past 20 years. People used to need to call a travel agent to book a flight, but now, there are websites like Agoda and Expedia, through which they can buy a ticket, book a hotel, and take out an insurance for their trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, in the container shipping industry, carriers like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have been investing heavily in digitization and <a href=\"https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2020/02/19/ap-moller-maersk-to-acquire-performance-team\" title=\"https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2020/02/19/ap-moller-maersk-to-acquire-performance-team\">acquiring</a> a number of trade services providers to diversify their revenue stream. The strategy allows them to enjoy a higher market cap than many other un-digitized carriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By doing so, Mr. O’Malley explains that these asset-heavy digitized players aim to gain market share by offering not only shipping but downstream services, from financing and insurance to tracking and warehousing, which are the real source of profits.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1591837436771.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-06/img-1591610320-56878@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-06/img-1591610320-56878@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-06/img-1591610320-56878@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"BlueX team\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Sean O’Malley, co-founder and CEO of BlueX / Phototgraph : BlueX</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>According to BlueX’s calculation, an whopping $2,100 can be extracted from a full ocean container in addition to the value of the freight. In other words, the services around shipping can potentially generate around $160 billion in fees annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, the company is taking another approach to helping carriers grow market cap -- by building an asset-light digital ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BlueX provides its carriers a white-label software platform and a marketplace of third-party logistics services to be plugged into the platform.

Innovation is part of its competitive advantage while entrepreneurship and industry cooperation is realized through its developmental objectives. The presentation focuses on the Executive Operation Office for Industry-Academia Cooperation (EOOIAC) of CYCU. It provides the approaches and practices of transforming a campus idea into successful startups. Best approaches suggest that the value-added is the systematic support system to shepherd potential entrepreneurs to have confidence in transitioning ideas into facilitating the need of humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CYCU is a leading integrated private university in Taiwan that traces its roots from its early beginnings in 1953 and 1980 when it became a university. &nbsp;Currently, it offers 38 graduate programs and 13 Ph.D. programs in 29 departments. It produces more than 120,000 alumni and most of them devote their best to the progress of society. &nbsp;Integrating, Creativity, and Innovation are the competitive advantages of CYCU through its development objectives of Holistic Education, Human Concern, and Service Learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has ranked CYCU since 1995 as being the integrated and most prestigious institution of higher education among private universities. Times Higher Education, the data provider that underpins universities’ excellence across the world, ranks CYCU as part of 1001+ World University Rankings 2020; 401-60<sup>th</sup> Impact Ranking 2020; 251<sup>th</sup> -300<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>Asia University Rankings 2019; and part of the top 20 Universities in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manager of EOOIAC of CYCU, Ms. Linda Chang張詠恰 shared about her unit’s value-added approaches and practices last April 2020. &nbsp;Specifically, in the areas of innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry cooperation. While she is driving the EOOIAC, Mr. Ming-Yen 李明彥 Lee, Ph.D. &nbsp;is providing tactics and strategy as Director of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center (IEDC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I met Ms. Chang while she promoted the in-campus startups during an international forum in CYCU sometime in October 2019. After that event, I had an opportunity of linking STARTBOARD with her and possible future collaboration and not competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although both CYCU and STARTBOARD are offering almost identical services, I highlighted to her that STARTBOARD is the first that incubates students’ start-ups from ASEAN Countries and India. It is not under any school, university, or government. As an incubator, it has resources that can strengthen incubatees’ performance. It has its law, patent, and marketing business group. &nbsp;As a flexible and versatile incubator, it considers branching out to countries it supported. Currently. it has an office in Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2019, she provided me a call for startups. &nbsp;I was interested in and submitted my idea. &nbsp;Luckily, my idea was one of the projects that have the potential for innovation and development. Accepted start-up entries included 3 projects of international students from the Philippines, Indonesia, India, and Haiti aside from the majority of its participants from local Taiwanese students and alumni. Start-up proposals were ranging from architecture, IT, farming technologies, and digital apps. &nbsp;Initial screening to clear plagiarism and novelty of ideas was done before the projects were enrolled in the tutoring module. &nbsp;I had the opportunity to attend expert advisory of marketing, general business management, and technology transfer that provided me insights and plans if I will decide to pursue my project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EOOIAC facilitated rough ideas for its potential innovation and development, product development, and ultimately to become startups. These are enabled through Intelligence Resource and Creativity Integration which composed of value-added module and capability module. &nbsp;Another resource in the international cooperation which implements the tutoring module such as expert advisory, business opportunity, leading technology transfer, venture capitalists match, industrial innovation settlement, international integration counseling, and accelerated development of enterprises. Theoretically, these are just module, what works best is the collaborations and support from 29 departments who have professors that become experts and consultants to these budding potential entrepreneurs. Likewise, the different centers such as Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Cooperation &amp; Technology Licensing, Industrial Accelerator &amp; Incubation, and Industrial Liaison are specialized to facilitate the developmental needs of the project transformation to become startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The schematic diagram below summarizes the whole process;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8E%9F1.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]-->From laboratory to startup is promoted through its campus entrepreneurship mechanism for professors. &nbsp;Each professor will do the original technology screening and background surveys of projects.

It’s an electrochemical gadget like blood glucose meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are a lot of manufacturers of this kind of meters in Taiwan, so it shouldn’t be a problem for us to find one and work together,” Chung says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performed outside the lab setting, LumiSTAR’s point-of-care testing (POCT) technique allows test results to be shared instantly with test performers and later on, healthcare providers for them to take necessary action like hospitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Detecting the virus with a glow</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, most antigen tests for the novel coronavirus are paper-based strips coated with antibodies. Like rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), they have often been criticized for giving false negatives. The same issue was raised around <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-white-house-test-staff-kits-accused-false-negatives-2020-5\" title=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-white-house-test-staff-kits-accused-false-negatives-2020-5\">Abbott’s rapid testing system</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang says her team abandoned the idea of developing paper tests, which take a matter of minutes for results but has serious limitation in terms of sensitivity and specificity. But still, there are other difficulties lying ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating an antigen test often involves a large-scale antibody production in lab animals like mice, rats, and rabbits, but it not only causes unnecessary suffering but ends up prolonging the development of an urgently-needed solution by four to six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid sacrificing animals, LumiSTAR turns to E. coli, a type of bacteria commonly found in human intestines, and Chang says now they are able to generate a sufficient amount of antibodies for experiments in just three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With the time spent on antibody production shortened, the cost also drops significantly,” Chung adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, during the manufacturing process, a fluorescent protein-based indicator is attached to all the antibodies, so when they bind to the coronavirus, a chemical reaction occurs and induces a glow with a light color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By converting the light into electricity, the same reaction that indicates a viral infection can be detected by the IVD device. Chung notes that among many advantages, the device is easy to use and allows high throughput screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their Taipei office, Chang says there are also several “readers” that can examine 96 throat swab specimens at a time, and if operated an entire day, can go through three to four thousand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"1284216\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"1284216\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Looking for new COVID-19 treatments</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the pandemic, LumiSTAR has been developing an all-optical platform for drug screening, and now, the startup plans to launch a similar platform for COVID-19 treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A drug works by blocking the virus at multiple points in its life cycle, from the entry into the cell, replication, to reorganization, and our platform examines if the blocking is effective.” Chang says. “If it inhibits viral replication, for example, the fluorescence is weakened.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective treatment may be like HAART for AIDS, which typically comprises of a combination of multiple antiretroviral drugs, Chung adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than repurposing known drugs, LumiSTAR is inclining towards identifying new treatments for COVID-19 -- in a wide array of herbal extracts provided by Taiwan’s Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center (PITDC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once it discovers an unknown but effective drug, the startup plans to license it to pharmaceutical companies or collaborate with contract research organizations, who conduct clinical trials for pharmas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There’s still a long way to go,” Chang says. As VC money flows into Taiwan due to its effective response to COVID-19, LumiSTAR has been actively talking with investors, hoping to scale up its business and make contributions to the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46569\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46569</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-06-19 02:23:28', '2020-06-19 02:23:28', NULL),

Starting from a live-streaming karaoke platform, iKala now operates two main divisions -- for cloud and retail solutions -- and offers services across Asia, from Japan, Taiwan, to countries in Southeast Asia like Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. Their clients include Ogilvy, L’Oreal, Foodpanda, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As the pandemic hits the global market, iKala has seen a 45% QoQ growth in revenue due to the strong demand for digital transformation,” said co-founder and CEO Sega Cheng. iKala’s cloud division was launched earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ad blockers and AI drive a paradigm shift in digital marketing, iKala decided to jump into smart retail to help clients sell their products more effectively and efficiently in Southeast Asia, where social commerce is taking over the online shopping arena.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1593394661077.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-10/img-1572241823-52683@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-10/img-1572241823-52683@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-10/img-1572241823-52683@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"iKala co-founder &amp; CEO Sega Cheng\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>iKala co-founder &amp; CEO Sega Cheng / Photograph : Asia Gen. T</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheng said the cloud division now makes up 60% to 70% of iKala’s revenue, “but as we expand in Southeast Asia, we are confident that the smart retail division will be on par with it within a year.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A head start in social commerce</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With 350 million Internet users in Southeast Asia and 90% connecting to the Internet via their smartphone, the opportunity for e-commerce businesses is massive. According to Google’s <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf\" title=\"https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf\">SEA e-conomy 2019 report</a>, the size of the market is forecast to exceed $100 billion per annum by 2025.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s noteworthy that the region has seen a leapfrogging in e-commerce. “Before traditional e-commerce sites become widely used, local customers are already turning to sellers on social media,” Cheng said. By contrast, in other Asian countries like Japan and Taiwan, customers tend to shop on e-commerce sites rather than buying from individual sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to this phenomenon, iKala has developed <a href=\"https://www.shoplus.me/en/\" title=\"https://www.shoplus.me/en/\">Shoplus</a>, a social commerce solution that “turns a Facebook fan page into a online retail shop in ten seconds.” With visual recognition, natural language processing technologies, and AI chat bot, Shoplus helps social media sellers communicate with their customers efficiently and send out retargeting messages. The solution increases conversion rate by 20% and reduces labor costs by 80%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a citywide lockdown, the solution has also helped Unilever Philippines move physical shops online and significantly boost its ROAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With two main strategies -- integrating existing physical sales channels and exploring new channels on social media, iKala hopes to empower companies with AI solutions and help them drive sales performance, according to a press release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using AI to put together the vast amount of data gathered both offline and online, iKala said it’s able to provide a clear picture of how each customer behaves and allow enterprises to achieve precision marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also boasts a proprietary technology that collects and analyzes data on social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram to help companies identify the best influencers they should work with to maximize the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"148196\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"148196\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Rise of East Asia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>iKala said it aims to become a dominant player in nine Asian countries, from Taiwan and Japan to Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Even if Taiwan as a market cannot sustain the growth of a hugely successful startup company, it might be possible for multiple markets of the same size,” said Lee Feng Chien, the former Google Taiwan managing director. He has joined iKala in February as an independent board member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size of Taiwan’s population, at just 23 million, makes it challenging for a startup to scale up domestically. However, located at the center of East Asia, with Japan and Korea in the north and SEA in the south, the island nation offers a great opportunity for businesses to expand regionally. Collectively, the population of these countries stands at around 800 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most East Asian countries have been managing the coronavirus crisis much more effectively than others, Chien said.

Social Media is one of the Digital Marketing channels by which the business can quickly reach their targeted customers. Small and Medium-sized business uses social media as an effective medium to attract leads, promote brand awareness, and engage with their customers. In this article, we are going to see the best performing social media channels in Taiwan. Through this article, we can understand the user\'s demographics and how we can utilize these social media platforms to drive growth for the business. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\" title=\"Page 1\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Instagram</p>\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/instagram_PNG12.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instagram is one of the largest social media platforms used in the present scenario. You can both post photos or short videos of your business and target them to your customers. It is intuitive rather than an informative platform. So the more unique your content is, the more followers you receive. According to the survey in the year 2016, 51% of internet users and 71% of youths aging 16-24 are using Instagram in Taiwan. Teenagers and youngsters aging 13 to 24 are engaging with the brand if they feel the contact is unique.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Facebook</p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/unnamed.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facebook usage in Taiwan has skyrocketed in recent years. About 19 million people are using this platform, which is about 79 percent of the entire population. People here use this platform for checking the shops, finding the events, and also buy or sell on Facebook, etc. There is an N number of ways to promote our business on Facebook, but usually, we do it by creating a fan page to develop our business. 18-44 years of age are the mainstream group using this platform, but there are also millions of users above 45 years of age using Facebook.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. PTT</p>\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/EWV3ajm.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">PTT is the most impactful online platform in Taiwan. On PTT, there are bullet boards of different topics, including CVS, gossips, politics, sports, literature, etc. It is so powerful that it can integrate youths for the social movement and regroup non-governmental powers. It is also used for entertainment purposes and to gossip about other information. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the peak time, there will be at most 150000+ people online, and most of them are at the age of 18-35. However, you directly can\'t promote your products or service in PTT, as it might increase negativity. Customers or the general public will be the ambassadors who promote the brand using word of mouth marketing.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Dcard</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/Dcard_Favicon_x520.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dcard is the biggest anonymous online community which is used by the young generation. It is more like a platform to share daily life rather than to promote products or services. The content discussed here is mostly related to life, especially schoolwork, current news, and affection. Dcard is similar to PTT, but it emphasizes more on linking with others. Most of the users are college students due to restrictions. 50.8% of users belong to ages 15 to 24, and there are about 42.5 thousand daily visitors visits Dcard. We can build brand awareness through word of mouth marketing in this platform.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 4\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5.

Meteor also has a bulletin board that contains topics like health, beauty, music, and food, etc. for discussion. It is also similar to Dcard to share your personal experience rather than promoting your product or service. You can build connections through this platform by word of mouth marketing.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6.

It has one of the biggest audiences in Taiwan, and the people of 16-24 years of age, on average, spend 2.5 hours a day. It has also become the platform for all the age groups, as per research 40% people consisting of age 55-64 watched YouTube every day for 1.5 hours. Mostly the users reach out to this platform for viewing recreational content and also informative content as per their needs. So, YouTube is the best channel to promote services and products by casting ads or sponsoring You Tubers. In this way, it is possible to increase brand awareness and multiply the customer base.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7 Medium</p>&nbsp;<img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1200px-Medium_logo_Monogram.svg.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 4\">\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medium is an online publishing platform that consists of high-quality articles mostly related to commerce and personal growth. It has got a better user interface when compared to other publishing sites. People usually search these Medium articles via Google, Bing, or Yahoo engines. By posting on this platform, we can increase the click rates for our domain. Medium itself has a high domain authority and an inbuilt tool to view stats about your post. It doesn\'t support external analytics tools like Google Analytics to track the performance.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">8.

The articles on PIXNET are usually long but quite resourceful. The blog articles posted here are diversified, from the record of restaurant experience to how to book a room in AGODA.

Most of the active users are men, and they post about 3C products, cars, and also share workplace experience. This platform is known for posting reviews after unboxing a product.

Hsu believes the tech giant’s early interest in his startup shows a “good sign” that they’re going in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the risk of turning Google into a potential competitor, he says he wasn’t concerned. “Big companies do a lot of things, but they don’t do a lot of them well,” he explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the same, investors can hesitate to bet on startups that compete with big tech firms, especially the Big Five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, Phil Chen, a general partner of Race Capital, says it didn’t seem smart to him to invest in Zoom back in 2016 -- but the video conferencing company has just reported a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/daily-crunch-zoom-reports-spectacular-growth/\" title=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/daily-crunch-zoom-reports-spectacular-growth/\">$169% YoY growth</a> due to the shift to remote work.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1594000030880.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593686741-35962@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593686741-35962@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593686741-35962@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Meet Global Salon_Phil Chen\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Phil Chen, general partner at Race Capital. / Photograph : Business Next</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I was in Horizons [Ventures], we were once investing in three companies at a time,” Chen says; they are Impossible Foods, Modern Meadow, and Zoom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the first two are ahead of their time, what Zoom offers is a similar service that Google and Microsoft have also been developing. The company tried to convince his team that it has the potential to grow much faster, but Chen says he remained dubious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, looking back, he says he knows how they made it, despite working on a “boring” product: “Even though Google and Microsoft have similar services, they are also focusing on other sexy things like AI.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, having limited resources often put startups in a less favorable position than big companies, but it allows them to focus on the success of a single product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As a startup, you don’t have a lot of money and resources to work on many different products,” says John Chen, the founder and managing partner of Hive ventures. “You have to focus on your core strength.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, he admits it\'s certainly not easy. In a startup he worked for, he has once run four different product lines due to customer requests. “Customers always have a lot of suggestions like whether you should build this feature or not,” Chen says; “but customization kills scalability.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, unlike customization, he believes standardization is necessary in product development, and to standardize a good enough product -- to replicate and sell it in global markets -- it’s still crucial to talk to users and learn from their feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best examples of “a startup that focuses” is Armorize Technologies, <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/security/240159768/proofpoint-seals-25-million-deal-for-armorize-technologies.htm\" title=\"https://www.crn.com/news/security/240159768/proofpoint-seals-25-million-deal-for-armorize-technologies.htm\">the cybersecurity company from which Jordon Forssman exited in 2013</a>.

All employees can submit a claim, apply for a leave, or time-off in the Swingvy platform instead of turning to a human HR, who then often needs to go through a series of paperwork to process them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the task of entering data into the system falls to the employees, HR managers will have the time to do other things that matter to the growth of the company, like building a organizational culture that values creativity and innovation, Cheoh explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For companies who haven’t built an HR team, they may invest the capital in other functions like R&amp;D and sales/marketing, which Cheoh considers the two main columns that support a tech startup like his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in Singapore and Malaysia, Swingvy says it plans to provide insurance options for companies in Taiwan in the near future. It means HR managers will be able to get the employees insured in several clicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“From day one, we have a vision that we want to be the operation system of companies,” Choeh says. “In the following two years, we are launching Swingvy insurance and will need time to expand this product line to Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now serving over 8,000 clients across Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, Swingvy looks to expand into Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia, which makes up a market of 70 million SMBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choeh believes to fully enjoy the benefits from his product, customers need to be in a market where the GDP is above $8,000 per capita. “Rather than relying on low-cost workforce, they will realize that using a software will bring a higher return on investment,” he explains.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1594005028873.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593537545-79132@900.png 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593537545-79132@900.png 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1593537545-79132@900.png 900w\" title=\"Jin Choeh.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Jin Choeh, Swingvy co-founder &amp; CEO / Photograph : Swingvy</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, COVID-19 has expedited digital transformation for companies, and it has been a boon for Swingvy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the company says it has lost some of the SME clients who shut down their business amid economic fallout from the pandemic, a great number of mid-sized companies have taken to implement its solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“While SMBs care more about saving time and cost, these mid-sized companies shifts to us from traditional HR software as part of their crisis management plan,” Cheoh explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legacy HR software, often installed on office PCs, might not be relevant after COVID-19, since many companies are considering allowing their employees to work from home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a SaaS provider, this policy change creates a huge growth opportunity for them, Cheoh says, and in response to that, Swingvy is adding a new time attendance system to its platform and plans to make it available to clients in all markets. Their employees will soon be able to punch in/out every day via an app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pandemic, Cheoh suggests that businesses create a protocol for remote work and be sensitive to the needs of their employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46615\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46615</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-07-06 03:11:15', '2020-07-06 03:12:00', NULL),

(291, 'Taiwan, catching up in software economy: Interview with Jordan Forssman', '2020-07-14', '', '<p>Fifteen years ago, software and Internet startups were few and far between in Taiwan. The country was still reveling in the success of indigenous semiconductor and PC industries, and with the vast majority of investors balking at investing in software due to the dotcom bust of 2000-2001, most companies preferred building their business around hardware to software solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was around the same time when Jordan Forssman and his teammates started to fundraise for their cybersecurity startup Armorize Technologies. He recalled meeting local investors, mostly from investment banks, who were old fashioned in how they communicate, operate, and structure their firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the day, most people in the investment sector are old at age, wear a suit with tie, and favor hardware companies. But as the local venture capital industry emerges, they’re being replaced by young analysts, in a T-shirt and jeans, passionately talking about new technologies they focus on like AI, blockchain, and genomics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s “a whole different vibe” in the investment community, Forssman described. He had been working as the head of business development for Armorize Technologies before it was <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquire-armorize-technologies-inc\" title=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquire-armorize-technologies-inc\">acquired by Proofprint in 2013</a>. “There was nothing like this when we started in Armorize, not even close.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his 17 years of living in Taiwan for study and work, Forssman witnessed first-hand not only how the the local investment environment has become more vibrant but also how drastically the country has changed in an effort to catch up in a software-based economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How far Taiwan has gone</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, hardware companies in Taiwan achieved their success by competing on price. With the cheapest products in hand, they didn’t need to reach out to customers with sophisticated marketing strategies; instead, they often waited for them to knock on their door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It was safe to do business, but you can only make it safe for so long,” Forssman said. “Now, the rest of the world catches up and competes with you, sometimes even in your home market.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s true that these companies have built Taiwan’s economy, but in the era of Internet and globalization, they risk being outcompeted by those who provide even cheaper products from countries like China and India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, this type of business is also becoming less and less attractive to the new venture builders. As this shift away from hardware plays out, investors are also feeling more comfortable backing companies who work on software solutions they used to dismiss as risky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In this era, you need to have a mindset shift to this risk loving approach,” Forssman said. “This change is inevitable, and if it’s forced upon you, you have no control.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With startup companies diving into new technologies and the support of venture capitalists, Taiwan may be “well on its way and more advanced than many other countries” <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/341247\" title=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/341247\">as a technological powerhouse</a>, Forssman said. But Taiwanese companies still need to learn to engage and interact with their customers around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He considers this to be one of the major challenges for the country to integrate into the global, knowledge-based economy. After all, “software and services are for people,” Forssman said, “not just about manufacturing a product and shipping it to other places in the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English-speaking countries like India, Ireland, and South Africa might gain an upper hand in this respect, but he expects the situation to turn around as <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3952051\" title=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3952051\">Taiwan transforms itself into a bilingual nation in the upcoming decade</a>. Along with other government initiatives like the Employment Gold Card, Forssman believes the change will attract foreign entrepreneurs and incentivize global companies to set up their regional headquarter or an R&amp;D center in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79=\"1371710\" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79=\"1\" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79=\"1371710\" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79=\"100\">Becoming the next Silicon Valley</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While Taiwan strives to earn a place in the new economy, the Internet has spawned hundreds of thousands of software startups in the Silicon Valley. Despite Taiwan’s efforts in becoming the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2017/02/07/how-taiwan-is-reinventing-its-national-culture-from-manufacturing-efficiency-to-innovation-ip/#22190b316650\" title=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2017/02/07/how-taiwan-is-reinventing-its-national-culture-from-manufacturing-efficiency-to-innovation-ip/#22190b316650\">Silicon Valley of Asia</a>, It can take a few decades for the island nation to catch up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For one, a typical Silicon Valley startup founder is “in their twenties but already in their second company or sixteen investments,” Forssman said. They hit rich at a young age, exit from their startup company, and start investing in other ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, Forssman said the first generation of successful software entrepreneurs like Wayne Huang, founder of Armorize Technologies, saw their opportunity to do the same only in their late thirties or early forties -- after spending a lot more years of building a company than their Silicon Valley counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The twenty- or thirty-year gap is indicative of how Silicon Valley is ahead of Taiwan, where the culture of running the risk to invest in future unicorns is just taking shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Forssman holds out hope that the <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316\">next wave of entrepreneurs</a> will help vitalize the ecosystem with their knowledge, network, and financial resources when they exit successfully at a younger age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, with a great number of accelerators created, young founders in Taiwan are also receiving support and learning how to build their first startup. “I think we are in the midst of building the environment for entrepreneurs,” Forssman said, to engage in the startup industry early in their life and keep it running.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recognizing what Taiwan has</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few years, Taiwan has been working to strengthen its innovation ecosystem by launching startup accelerators and incubators like <a href=\"https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=135672\" title=\"https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=135672\">Taiwan Tech Arena</a> and funding startup companies. But doing so with Silicon Valley as the only reference drives the country into a tunnel vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s a great target to be like, but don’t forget that other countries, who also want to be like the Valley, don’t have what you have,” Forssman suggested. “Be aware of the fact that you’re lucky.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, he’s talking about the group of Taiwanese-American entrepreneurs, who have successfully exited from their startups via acquisition in the 2000s like Steve Chen (co-founder of Youtube), Jameson Hsu (founder of Mochi Media), and Kai Huang (founder of RedOctane). Remembered as the <a href=\"https://www.mafia.tw/\" title=\"https://www.mafia.tw/\">Taiwan Mafia</a> -- reminiscent of the Paypal Mafia, most of them have been staying in Taiwan now to help local startup founders build and grow their business globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Most countries don’t have the success stories coming back home, re-planting the seeds, and sharing their knowledge,” Forssman said, noting that it makes a huge difference in the ability to develop a new industry and catch up with the rest of the world. “People in Taiwan don’t understand how special this is.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most recently, Taiwan’s success in handling the coronavirus pandemic has put the nation in the spotlight, and Forssman said it should take advantage of the situation to reach out to other countries. He called the <a href=\"https://taiwancanhelp.us/\" title=\"https://taiwancanhelp.us/\">\"Taiwan Can Help\" campaign</a> of mask donations a brilliant act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago when working for Armorize, Forssman recounted, they needed to explain to their customers that they’re a Taiwanese company. But now, “everybody knows about Taiwan because of COVID-19,” and, quite unexpectedly, Hong Kong’s civil unrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With increased visibility and many advantages for businesses -- a clear legal framework, protection of intellectual property rights, and close connections with neighboring countries like Japan, to name a few, he believes Taiwan will come out of the crisis much stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46655\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46655</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-07-14 07:44:42', '2020-07-14 07:45:19', NULL),

It also brings overseas startups to Taiwan to grow their presence in Asia. For example, it has led the Series B funding of <a href=\"https://arriscomposites.com/\" title=\"https://arriscomposites.com/\">Arris Composite</a>s in April this year.

But as a matter of fact, there are more dental clinics than 7-11 convenience stores in Taiwan,” said Ivan Tsou, the founder of Formosation Oral Tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/000.jpg\" style=\"width: 570px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\" alt=\"STARTBOARD was delighted to arrange an interview with Ivan Tsou on July 17th, 2020.\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ivan Tsou, the Founder of Formosation Oral Tech</strong>\r\n	<br>Tsou, developed a passion for dental knowledge when he was a sales representative in a dental equipment supply company. His original background is in business management. “When dentists communicate with each other, they use terminologies such as prophylaxis, prosthesis, interproximal and you will think to yourself, “what?”, said Tsou. So, that was the impetus: giving him a thirst for learning, including equipment, practices, terminologies, and processes; and gaining a deep understanding of it -all in less than a month. As well as traveling back and forth either from Taipei to Xizi or Taipei to Taitung to demonstrate and sell dental equipment to potential customers. Here, Tsou reminds us of Satya Nedella’s quote, “Be passionate and bold. Always keep learning. You stop doing useful things if you do not learn”. Tsou is not merely learning Taiwan’s dental ecosystem, but also seizing the opportunity for reinvention. It was not as much a decision to become an entrepreneur as it was merely a realization that is what Tsou was meant to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tsou and Ho: The Peanut Butter and Jelly</strong>\r\n	<br>It all started with two words- holy moly, enough to break the ice with his co-founder, Frederick Ho. The boys met through their military service in Taiwan. Tsou completed his primary education in Auckland, New Zealand, and followed grandma back to Taipei, Taiwan. On the other hand, Ho obtained his degree in Industrial Designing from the University of South Australia. Tsou spoke about why he and Ho complement each other so well: “It’s kind of the task-oriented versus people-oriented personality spectrum. I am a people-oriented person, he is strongly task-oriented. I place more importance on the feelings and happiness of people. He makes sure we all are productive and efficient.” Applying Chef Justin Warner’s “the law of peanut butter and jelly”. The author thinks that Ho is the peanut butter and Tsou is the jelly. Ho gives the sandwich a smooth creamy texture with a touch of sweetness from Tsou. All these gloriousness are held together by the team. The combination is basic yet delicious and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which came first: the customer segmentation or the value proposition?</strong>\r\n	<br>Formosation Oral Tech<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is in the process of discovering and fine-tuning its business model. The process involves frequent contact with their mentors: STARTBOARD, LINE product manager, INTEL outlook customer manager, to name a few. And also, learning through pitching competitions. Since almost everything is built from scratch, the process of fine-tuning can apply to all facets of the startup. Personally, Tsou sheds light on these facets: customer segmentation, value proposition, and channel. He asked, “the egg and the chicken, which came first? Or which is more important?” He further explained, “you have to define the value proposition of your products, then you will know who your target audience is or vice versa- you identify your target customer, then tailor your product accordingly. So, both are crucial.” The target audience of Formosation Oral Tech is the dental clinic dentist. According to the research Cheng et al. (2020) had done, the northern region of Taiwan and Taipei City had 52.81% (7829/14,825) and 22.29% (3304/14,825) of the total number of dentists in 2019, respectively. To sum up this section: Chosen correctly, that one thing will set off a domino effect that leads you to success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AntiQ = Floss + App</strong>\r\n	<br>He continued, “dentists will clean patients’ teeth and check for cavities and gum disease during a dental exam. After the exam, they will discuss patients’ oral health conditions and suggest some preventive practices patients can take to protect their oral health. However, dentists rarely prescribe drugs to their patients. This clearly shows that like other areas of the body, our mouth teems with bacteria, mostly harmless. In other words, good oral health care such as daily brushing and flossing will keep bacteria from turning virulent.” Research indicated that 95% of Taiwanese brush daily. However, less than 30% of Taiwanese floss regularly, and a whopping 70% or more do not floss at all. This raises the question of “why are people against flossing?” There are three main reasons: (1) “traditional dental floss user-unfriendly”, 70%; (2) “gap between teeth getting bigger” or “bleeding gums”, 60%; and (3) “do I need to floss my teeth?”, 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/333.jpg\" style=\"width: 900px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meet the team&nbsp;</strong>: Federick, Jacob and Ivan (from left to right)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\r\n	<br>Formosation Oral Tech<strong>&nbsp;</strong>came out with a new product called AntiQ which has the ability to tackle the above-mentioned problems.

The check-ups include detecting the molecular, cell and systemic aberrant signal of the immune and tissue repair system involved in the tumorigenesis and cancer progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the research studies at National Tsinghua University (NTHU), carcinogen can grow for up to 10 years before causing physical symptoms and one single cancer cell does not necessarily turn into a tumor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By maintaining proper conditions for cells, an estimation of 80% patients can be cured even if they are exposed to high risk cancers in stomach or liver. The research team at ConnSante Biotech has been working with the National Taiwan University Hospital on almost 2,000 clinical researches and discovered multiple decisive factors on cancer recurrence. The team stressed much on monitoring the development of possible cancer cells and wants to nip them in the bud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ConnSante Biotech focuses on strengthening people’s “cancer-prevention capability.” The team believes everyone is a “cancer suspect” and it is best to understand people’s tumor related status before it is too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Soteria Biotech</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://soteriabio.com/\" title=\"http://soteriabio.com/\">Soteria Biotech</a> develops innovative medical solutions and products for sleeping disorders like obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). One of them is “Soteria One Point Zero”, a cloud based stand-alone software platform; it shows and analyzes patients’ head and neck stock images for airway flow characteristics, helping physicians decide whether their airways are obstructed and, if so, at which location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Approximately 80% of the world’s population have OSAS but are yet to be confirmed,” said Honda Hsiao, the CEO of Soteria Biotech. “The service can help quadruple the amount of confirmed cases annually, from 50,000 to 200,000 with an 88% accuracy,” Hsiao continued. “As the database keeps building up, doctors can find their patients to find a more suitable mouthpiece to enhance the effectiveness of treatments engaged.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, patients with OSAS need to go through a series of complicated nocturnal monitoring of respiratory and cardiac parameters with a sleep specialist. Those checkings may involve examinations on patients’ throat, mouth and nose with measurement neck circumference and blood pressure. It is a long test before patients can confirm their status. In addition, physical therapy and surgery are most commonly used to treat the syndrome, but some patients find the physical treatments cumbersome and uncomfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has, therefore, developed the Soteria OA (obstructive apnea) Solution, an analytical system for adjusting snoring mouthpiece with tomographic images. The solution has been granted <a href=\"http://soteriabio.com/about/\" title=\"http://soteriabio.com/about/\">patents</a> from the United States, Taiwan, Singapore and China. Soteria Biotech is now working with dental laboratories and breather manufacturers and expecting to sign partnership with dentist clinics this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WellGen Medical</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wellgen.info/en-home\" title=\"https://www.wellgen.info/en-home\">WellGen Medical</a> creates automated microscopes for tuberculosis detection to replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for quicker testing and higher accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PCR is a widely used laboratory technique for making millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample rapidly at a lower cost, allowing scientists to take a small sample of DNA and compare it with the DNA samples of known tuberculosis DNA patterns. Currently, doctors need five minutes on average to go through each sample, which means 80 to 100 cases on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With WellGen’s automated microscope, the assessment time for each sample is now at two mintues with accuracy of 85% to 90%. By using the automated microscopes, physicians can avoid spending time going through all samples manually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WellGen also provides a system that accepts the intra- and inter-laboratory variations in staining methodology techniques. The system collects all data and stores them in the database with different combinations of diagnosis results. With cloud computing, the analysis software can update and improve the detection accuracy as the number of samples accumulates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a><br></strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46733\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46733</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-07-31 01:52:12', '2020-07-31 01:52:12', NULL),

Meanwhile, part of the business development teams in Japan, Europe and the US were cut and the office in India was closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are seeing signs of recovery in some markets. However, we are still far away from pre-COVID-19 levels,” Lin wrote to his staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the resurgence of coronavirus cases in Hong Kong and Australia signaled that “the road to recovery is fragile” and Klook does not know “when travel will resume in full force.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. In May, Uber and Airbnb also announced their layoff plans, slashing workforce by 14% and 25% respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taiwan office took a hard hit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Klook expanded its staff in Taiwan as part of the plan to <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45250\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45250\">build a large online customer service center</a> to help travelers in 11 languages. But the demand for such assistance has dropped significantly since countries around the world started imposing travel restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“With travel restrictions still in place, the volume of travelers today is nowhere near the levels from 2019,” Lin wrote in the note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Klook has tried different approaches to offset the loss in the whole pandemic swirl, including promoting domestic trips and stay-at-home experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Travel bubble is an alternative we are looking forward to, but it seems like countries are making slow progress. The travel industry may go back to normal only after an effective vaccine is available in the market” Lin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel bubble is an agreement between a set of countries to open their borders exclusively to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s next for ex-Klookers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Klook provides a generous package to the staff the company is letting go. They will receive an extra severance pay on top of local labor law standard and continue to receive healthcare coverage. They are also allowed access to Klook’s employee assistance program and keep the company-issued laptops for job seeking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefit Klook offers is not unprecedented. Earlier in May, when Airbnb announced its layoff, it provided a 14-weeks of base pay with one extra week for every year of experience at the company. Ex-employees are also entitled to their healthcare coverage throughout 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ttgasia.com/2020/04/21/klook-trims-workforce-impose-pay-cuts-to-ride-out-covid-19-storm/\" title=\"https://www.ttgasia.com/2020/04/21/klook-trims-workforce-impose-pay-cuts-to-ride-out-covid-19-storm/\">Since April</a>, Klook has been taking measures to reduce costs.

(303, 'Taiwanese professor turns to crowdfunding for rocket launch', '2020-08-11', '', '<p>Jong-Shinn Wu has a dream of launching a rocket into space, and the people of Taiwan are helping him realize it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a professor of mechanical engineering, he has led the <a href=\"https://arrc.tw/\" title=\"https://arrc.tw/\">Advanced Rocket Research Center</a> (ARRC) at National Chiao-Tung University to launch the first hybrid rocket successfully in 2014. Flying to a height of ten kilometers, HTTP-3S stayed in the air for around ten minutes to carry out measurements and send them back to the ground in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Wu’s new rocket is different. Instead of a instrument-carrying rocket, HTTP-3A is similar to a launch vehicle that blasts satellites into low-earth orbit, only smaller in size. He expects to launch this rocket next summer. If succeeded, it will be a huge step for Taiwan to the future of sending objects into orbit independently on domestically built rockets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Taiwan is still dependent on foreign rockets and launchpads to send satellites into space. In June, Formosat-7, the constellation of six satellites jointly built by Taiwan and the US, was <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3731695\" title=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3731695\">launched by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket</a> from the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To continue developing and testing HTTP-3A, specifically its upper stage engine that propels the rocket in space, Wu is now seeking financial support from the people who want to be part of <a href=\"https://crowdfunding2020.arrc.tw/\" title=\"https://crowdfunding2020.arrc.tw/\">the ambitious project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You can sometimes be so much ahead of the government and the private sector that they refuse to buy into your idea,” he talks about his crowdfunding attempt in 2015. “But those who are on the same page will find you on crowdfunding platforms.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years ago, Wu has raised around NT$12 million ($408,000) via crowdfunding and later founded <a href=\"http://www.tispace.com/\" title=\"http://www.tispace.com/\">Taiwan Innovative Space Inc.</a> (TiSPACE) with his students to enter the crowded market of small satellite launch, the first private company in Taiwan specializing in space technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TiSPACE came under spotlight in February for the proposed launch of Hapith-1, Taiwan’s first domestically built rocket. The liftoff was aborted <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/14/2003730963\" title=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/14/2003730963\">due to bad weather conditions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite ending up leaving the company in 2018, Wu considers his two years running the company to be invaluable. “Leaving the academia, I had the opportunity to meet with top professionals in the industry of spacecraft production, and that confirmed my belief that Taiwan has the capability to build its own rocket,” he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, Wu says there are suppliers of almost all types of components used in rocket construction, from heat-proof materials for engine nozzles to liquid oxidizers. Unknown to the world, they develop technologies that can be applied across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This wouldn’t be possible without a robust semiconductor industry,” he <a href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2\" title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2\">adds</a>. “Some materials like the concentrated hydrogen peroxide used for cleaning silicon wafers often come in handy for us.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, the island is ideal <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46716\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46716\">as a launch site due to its proximity of the equator</a>, where the surface of the Earth rotates at the highest speed, making it easier for a rocket to reach the velocity required to achieve orbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to the academia, Wu continues to pursue his dream to put Taiwan on the map of the global space industry, which currently <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space\" title=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space\">generates more than $350 billion</a> in economic output and is forecast to value at $1 trillion in 2040.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its size, his latest rocket, HTTP-3A, isn’t yet able to send satellites into orbit, but he says its propulsion, avionics, communications systems are all comparable to those of launch vehicles, and if everything goes well with the development, they believe they can propel the rocket to a height of 100 kilometers in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two to three years after the launch, we may see the first MIT (made-in-Taiwan) carrier rocket sent to the space, he claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If you have a chance to see a rocket launch on site, you will be moved to tears,” Wu <a href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2\" title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2\">says</a>. “If we can launch rockets on our own, it will be an honor for the people of Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the crowdfunding project, Wu believes it is just the beginning of the story. “Our goal is to let everyone around the world know Taiwan can achieve what many believe to be impossible,” he proudly says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a><br></strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46773\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46773</a> </p>', NULL, 1, '2020-08-11 02:05:04', '2020-08-11 02:05:04', NULL),

With the mission to build more early childhood centers in urban slums globally at the back of their mind, IMPCT launched the “Coffee for the future” program to allow people around the world to buy bags of coffee beans from developing countries like Honduras and Guatemala and contribute to local school construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The packaging of the coffee products was designed to look like a brick, <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018\" title=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018\">symbolizing that each purchase is a brick</a> to build a better future.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1597714958515.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-08/img-1597385287-21221@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-08/img-1597385287-21221@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-08/img-1597385287-21221@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"image4\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></figure>\r\n<figure>Impct / Photograph: Facebook fanpage</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Customers can scan a code inside the coffee box and <a href=\"https://bricks.impct.co/\" title=\"https://bricks.impct.co\">pick a preschool</a> they hope to help build Montessori preschools in Latin America founded by IMPCT that upskill local women as school owners and provide education to children. When the school is built, they receive a notification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is beneficial to coffee farmers living in developing countries, who often earn too little to make ends meet while large coffee companies engaging in greenwashing are raking it in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While 25% of the revenue goes towards building schools and nurturing low income women, 20% goes to the coffee farmers and 15% of the profit is invested in collaborative local roasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Same goal, new approach</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When IMPCT was building schools in Latin America, they were <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657\" title=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657\">contemplating how they could give back to Taiwan</a>. The team planned a visit to numerous areas in Taiwan such as Pingtung and Hsinchu to investigate whether they can apply what they did in Honduras, Guatemala, and South Africa to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their trip, they realized right away that the early education scene in Taiwan is completely different from Latin America or Africa. Many schools in the rural areas were closing because there were not enough admissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They started thinking what the community really needs and how they can help.

Many medical workers decide not to go to the toilet for four hours just to avoid putting on and taking off their heavy hazmat suits,” said Jerry Chen, Brain Navi’s founder and CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The robot locates a person’s nostril, inserts a long swab into it, collects the fluid, and transfers it into a closed container. All the work is done without human assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though medical workers still need to get close to help positioning the patient into a head holder, they can later supervise the entire procedure at ease behind a transparent panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brain Navi’s robot also prevents medical workers from causing discomfort to their patients. Instead of deciding how far to insert the swab based on experience, they can simply rely on the robot, which scans the patients’ facial structure to locate the exact spot to collect the fluid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen added the positioning error of the robot is smaller than 2mm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new device is based on several fundamental functions of Brain Navi’s previous neurosurgical navigation robot NaoTrac.

People started to create an eco-friendly society to reduce environmental impact. Clothes Telling is an organization that builds a platform for the public to exchange their second-hand clothes without any additional charge. To them, every piece of clothing has its own story. Their mission is to continue their stories by finding them new owners and spread love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/116741218_876789369474818_1493341014178878200_n.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>【Second Hand, Second Chance】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What moment has inspired you to create ‘Clothes Telling’? The founder Ivy Hung said, “The economic inequality issue has existed over the past decade. In this modern society, shopping is a hobby. With the constant discounts and sales, the amount of clothing we bought has increased dramatically.” She wanted to change the environment and society, which is the main reason she started her company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does sharing closet work? The founder explained, “People write down the stories of their clothes and hang them up to exchange with others. You not only receive new clothes, you also extended the life of your clothes. Co-Founder Maggie Chang pointed out how secondhand clothing traders are very common in Europe markets. They also saw the growing trend in clothing resale market from 2014 to 2023 worldwide. With Clothes Telling, they. want to offer a different approach to the public. For example, you can either turn your unwanted clothes into virtual tokens or purchase virtual tokens in cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not easy to start a business. The path to success is paved with reality. They’ve encountered many problems when they tried to establish their own business model. For instance, the relatively small sized target audience in Taiwan, high proportion of variable cost, and other legal problems. It also took them a long time to transform their business from not profitable to profitable. Instead of worrying about the problem, they decided to ask professionals in the industry for help. Finally, ‘Clothes Telling’ has developed a unique business model that allows them to receive 20% revenue share from users who purchase their tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/%E6%89%8B%E6%A9%9F%E8%A9%A6%E7%94%A8.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>【More value, Less burden】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since COVID-19 poses a threat to the global economy, it has changed shopping behaviors significantly. Ivy Hung said, “The new features we developed will launch in the near future. It is convenient and will allow users to keep social distancing while exchanging their clothes via our app.” They designed applications with various functions. For example, implementing intelligent classification, utilizing databases to analyze consumer preference, and setting up clear information about used clothes. Moreover, Clothes Telling partnered with other social enterprises for the use of virtual tokensuch as ‘Greenvines’ and ‘agooday’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about their long-term goal? Ivy Hung said that they might focus more on outfits variations and kids’ garments soon. Due to their innovative solution for unwanted clothes, they not only solve the problem of disposing unwanted clothes to landfills, they also created a new space for sharing closets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/%E5%A5%B3%E4%BA%8C%E8%88%8D%E5%86%8A%E7%AB%99.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>【Reality verses Dream】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s impossible to know everything about running your business. The truth is that reality is always cruel because your business will always challenge you, and people often put you down. People doubted their business model in various aspects. However, Ivy Hung said that they are always open to advice so they can improve their business. Age is nothing but a number; they have learned many valuable lessons about running a business. A senior once ask them, “If you could spend 20 million to buy a house or a dream, what would you choose?” They chose dream. They never regret building Clothes Telling. They want to make a little difference in the society by changing people’s behavior so everyone can live more sustainably and help save the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>【Join Social Innovation Lab, Turn your dream into reality】</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who are interested in the sharing closet economy, you can find more information via their Facebook page. They share information regarding second-hand markets and introduce other social enterprises. Clothes Telling was selected as one of the startup organizations to station at ‘Social Innovation Lab’ because of their innovative solutions for environment challenges.

Despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA), Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Chinese Taipei and Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (CSMEs) of Indonesia successfully co-hosted this event through virtual means, signifying the bonds and connections between APEC economies, SMEs and women entrepreneurs will not be broken by the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n	<br>The participants of the event were mostly women entrepreneurs who came from various backgrounds including NGOs, industries, policy makers and start-ups from the APEC economies. Together these key stakeholders shared their experiences and insights on how to empower female entrepreneurs, strengthening the cooperation among SMEs in APEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Empowering Women and Building Capacities</strong>\r\n	<br>The workshop began with opening remarks delivered by Ms. Pei-Ti Hu, Deputy Director General of SMEA, MOEA and Mr. Hanung Harimba Rachman, Deputy Minister for Financing of CSMEs. \"As women entrepreneurs\'&nbsp;role in economic development become more and more important, it is clear that every government need to ensure a gender friendly entrepreneurial environment in their respective economies,\"&nbsp;said Ms. Pei-Ti Hu.\r\n	<br>\"We know that the potential of women entrepreneurs has not yet been fully unleashed, and that by empowering women entrepreneurs in the APEC economies, we can contribute to the region\'s overall inclusive growth and share prosperity,\"&nbsp;continued Ms. Hu, as she stressed the importance of women empowerment and the essential goal of the workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative</strong>\r\n	<br>Although women\'s capability on access to market and capital in the APEC region has improved over the years, it was shown on a 2019 report by the APEC policy support unit that in terms of capital access, it is still harder for women to access credit in comparison to men; while in terms of market access, women\'s entry still faces regulatory and legal barriers.\r\n	<br>With the goal to increase women\'s access to capital and market, Chinese Taipei, co-sponsored by Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines proposed the APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative. This workshop is the first event held under the initiative. A second workshop will be hosted in October in Malaysia, followed by a third workshop to be hosted in November in Taipei. Finally, a concluding APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Forum will be hosted in November in Taipei.\r\n	<br>Through these events, Chinese Taipei will continue to strive for women\'s empowerment and for the advancement of women\'s economic participation to create a more enabling environment toward inclusive growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further details, or to arrange possible media interviews, please contact:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Pei-Ti Hu\r\n	<br>Deputy Director General, Small and Medium Enterprise Administration, MOEA\r\n	<br>02-2368-0816 #202\r\n	<br>bdhu@moea.gov.tw</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Hsin-Yi Tseng\r\n	<br>Section Chief, Incubation Division, Small and Medium Enterprise Administration, MOEA\r\n	<br>02-2368-0816 #257\r\n	<br>thy@moea.gov.tw</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-08-28 01:37:29', '2020-08-28 01:37:29', NULL),

The company based in Kaohsiung is most renowned for its smart home wireless remote control named i-Ctrl, a product that won the <a href=\"https://www.taiwanexcellence.org/tw/award/product/38410\" title=\"https://www.taiwanexcellence.org/tw/award/product/38410\">Taiwan Excellence Award 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://www.german-design-award.com/en/the-winners/gallery/detail/29604-i-ctrl-the-wireless-smart-home-device.html\" title=\"https://www.german-design-award.com/en/the-winners/gallery/detail/29604-i-ctrl-the-wireless-smart-home-device.html\">German Design Award 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When Taiwan is no longer an empire of ODM/OEM, small and middle-sized enterprises usually face one problem: not knowing how to push forward their existing brands and services to the market,” said Ni Wen-lu, founder and CEO at AIFA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How do you bring the public\'s attention to your products? That is the key to success. Most companies in Taiwan spend their time on their products, but they need to realize it is also important to think about how to market and sell them.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To AIFA, it means crowdfunding. The company launched its first crowdfunding campaign of a battery saver on flyingV, a Taiwanese fundraising platform, in 2016. Despite failure to meet the funding goal, the team bounced back in summer and soon launched its second crowdfunding project to finance i-Ctrl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wireless remote control i-Ctrl has sensors that send and receive signals in a 360 degree radius. This allows users to control all home devices, such as air conditioners, curtains, lamps, and TV, on their phone or through voice commands in the distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company, hitting its funding goal of NT$50,000 (US$1,703), raised NT$758,000 (US$25,817).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As an ODM, it was hard for us to communicate with end users, and their comments about the products we designed and manufactured would never reach us,” Ni said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through crowdfunding, they build a bridge to consumers. It allows them to collect real-time feedback from customers and respond to their requests in an agile manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the two-way communication, AIFA found out that i-Ctrl is used not only at homes but hospitals and hostels. With the product, nurses turn on lights and cameras remotely in the intensive care unit so families can video call the patient who is not well enough for a face-to-face chat. Hostel owners save money on their electric bill by monitoring and turning off air-conditioners that are not in use through i-Ctrl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, AIFA launched its third crowdfunding product i-Ctrl Pro. The updated version of i-Ctrl analyzes and records user data to automatically adjust temperature and humidity. Through its mobile app, users can turn off the television that they forget to turn off and schedule various presets adjusting the temperature or humidity level for every occasion.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1599208038617.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1596092351-58050@900.png 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1596092351-58050@900.png 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-07/img-1596092351-58050@900.png 900w\" title=\"AIFA\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>AIFA launched i-Ctrl Pro on flyingV this June, four years after its first model i-Ctrl. / Photograph : FlyingV</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>AIFA has also developed its own IoT database for local infrared devices, so i-Ctrl Pro can consolidate and activate the remote control functions of infrared home devices from most brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni shared the reason behind. One of the top concerns with smart home devices among Taiwanese is that their existing home appliances come from various brands and manufacturers around the world, and it is not worthwhile to buy a new fridge or air conditioners for the sole purpose of accommodating a smart home automation system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the future, Ni commented: “It was not easy to build a head-to-toe Taiwanese brand like AIFA here.

At the beginning of her sharing, she talks about the digital transformation because of COVID-19. Due to the Epidemic, many offline activities have been canceled, Even the world\'s most iconic Consumer Electronics Show was forced to cancel. But it transformed into a dedicated exhibition mode. And there have more and more offline campaigns that have altered into online ones. It\'s would be the trend in the future. As a result, outreach to media and buyers became very important. After that, Romona shared about a project event called “WiSE 24”, and how it helps women’s startups build their brands and outreach to others in the global. In the event, there has an online brand page, which is a platform for startups to outreach others when having online activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/P1144844.jpg\" style=\"width: 660px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the press kit on the brand page made it easier for the press, business, and buyers to reach out to the startups. And the platform has more than 80,000 media from all over the world which could help startups team connect to the media easier. In the end, Romona encouraged all participants to use LinkedIn into their best BD partners, because there are over 650 million people on it. “why we are a startup and why we are an entrepreneur, the answer is that we want to make an impact to the world. And how to make it depends on us. All the female leaders, we are the one” said Romona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/BR6I4609.jpg\" style=\"width: 661px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Hans</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hans has over 30 years of corporate guidance experience.

At last, he also emphasized that all the entrepreneurs should do the things that are playful and fun for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/BR6I3562.jpg\" style=\"width: 629px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Q＆A section, all entrepreneurs’ questions are very diverse and enthusiastic such as how interaction and online events will change due to Covid-19? or how to reinforce core value through day by day practice. And the speakers have responded passionately to those questions. After the workshop, STARTBOARD, as an ASEAN incubator in Taiwan, we hope that it can efficiently enhance female entrepreneurial participation and help eliminate the limitations for women’s entrepreneurs. Moreover, we regard it as important for Southeastern countries to have cross border collaborations on assisting businesswomen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/BR6I3461.jpg\" style=\"width: 629px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last, STARTBOARD is glad to have Romona and Hans, two of the excellent speakers in the event, and we hope to see more and more female entrepreneurs starting their own business globally. And STARTBOARD is always here to be the support for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-09-24 07:18:50', '2023-09-25 14:22:34', NULL),

(330, 'How will new trends and technologies bring challenges to this young generation?', '2020-10-01', '', '<p>CEO of STARTBOARD ASEAN-Indian Startup Incubator</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever been asked the question ”What do you want to be when you grow up?” You may have answers such as a professional athlete, singer, astronaut, president of the U.S.A, etc. Then time flies by and you realize that you are in a new generation, which is significantly different from what your parents had. A lot of jobs didn’t exist 10 years ago, for example, YouTubers, social media influencers, E-sport gamers, and so forth. The technology iterates frequently and leads to an alternative lifestyle. Meanwhile, it also brings challenges to this young generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2020, the meeting indicated several new trends and warnings for the career of the new generation. Having a sophisticated skill is no longer a golden ticket to ensure a good career. World Economic Forum forecasts that “As jobs are transformed by the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we need to reskill over 1 billion people by 2030. In the next two years – by 2022 – 42% of core skills required to perform existing jobs are expected to change.” Is it scary? We must see our career path with a fresh perspective. The mindset we all need is developing not only high-tech skills, but also specialized interpersonal skills that are in high demand. No matter what generation you are in, it will be more important to have the ability of sales, negotiation, creativity, persuasion, and other people-to-people skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new technologies may decrease the demand for repetitive, machine-like jobs, but it also free up people to find other people-oriented careers which are hardly replaced by the machine. Governments and leading corporates know the trend and the transformation. What is their plan? They encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurship is not a new concept, but it is a panacea for every industrial transformation. Entrepreneurs are always seizing the chance to create new technologies when people are complaining, which the technology later take over their jobs. They find a problem and use alternative solution. The government offers incentives and tax reductions for entrepreneurs to support their business. As a result, entrepreneurs and their innovation provide new job opportunities and pushes people to develop new skills. The leading companies encourage innovation and provide resources for startups, then the corporates strategically partner with budding startups or acquire them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the very first question is: “What industry you will dive into?”For those you do not know the career path or the business segments you want to enter, there is a nascent trend–lazy economy and 5G technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, as you might expect, the lazy economy is characterized by timesaving, labor-saving, hyper-convenient products, and services that meet the needs of the customers. There are two major parts of the lazy economy: F&amp;B service and timesaving service. They meet people’s diversified and ever-increasing consumer demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]--><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1601545874275.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gradually, we are ushering in a new level of customer experience and it still has many opportunities for businesses in the lazy economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]--><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1601546051494.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scaling of the food delivery platform makes a tremendous demand for delivery workers and drivers. This means more people will engage in this or related industry. People can work for this flexible and task-oriented part-time job, instead of committing to work for a full-time position. According to Statista, the Projected Revenue of Food Delivery Services booms 92% since 2017 and its projected revenue forecast will thrive in the coming two years. Building on that, there are more and more related F&amp;B services that are still developing and changing our consumer behaviors like ingredient-and-recipe meal kit service, personal chef platform, and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides F&amp;B service providers, diligent entrepreneurs provide new timesaving services to free people from their chores, such as elderly home care, errands, delivery, housekeeping, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, the fifth generation of the network is an often-heard word this year. It is not merely a faster internet, but it changes every aspect of life. Just like your old Nokia cellphone compared to the latest version of the iPhone. 5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds with <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2019/05/13/how-5g-low-latency-improves-your-mobile-experiences\">&nbsp;low latency</a>. It has higher performance, is more reliable, and will improve efficiency for better user experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples of how national-wide 5G can change our life and create opportunities for the next generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]--><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1601546077822.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Healthcare</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5G network makes a faster data transaction. The medical workers can receive real-time global medical info to support the diagnosis and hold virtual meetings to provide the first-hand info to their patience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high-speed internet brings immersive experiences and allows performers to have interactions with their audience with ultra-low latency. The entertainment industry will be the first field to apply new devices, features, technologies stimulating smart manufacturing, smart life, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big data management</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New technologies generate massive amount of data. Analytic tools, cybersecurity, and data management are critical issues for startups. Gold mines are no longer underground; the gold in the cyber era will be stored in the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By turning data into information, it can help people and artificial intelligence make rational decisions, reduce potential risk, and efficiently iterate new technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is significant change in our traditional career and the way to run a business; therefore, the new mindset is helping us prepare for the upcoming transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]--><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1601546107419.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shift in workforce</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the shift in the workforce will transform from a repetitive task to more creative jobs. Slashies is defined as–a group of people who have had multiple “slashes” in their titles and multiple career skills. People don’t need to commit to only one job, but they can have diversified career opportunities. For the young generation, they are born this way; nevertheless, for the X or Y generation, it would be a harsh question “who you are without your primary job title? “</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legal compliance&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law and regulation have always fallen behind when technology takes a huge leap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right or wrong has a grey area until the law has been fixed. The 5G would make a convenient communication channel, but what if it makes unreasonable work hours and work-life imbalance? Regarding personal privacy, how could we avoid the monopoly of searching engines and platforms to exploit our data and personal information for their profit, but still enjoy their services?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<!--[if !vml]--><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1601546133314.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unavoidably, the technology will widely influence the business and people’s career; however, entrepreneurs are a bunch of people that overcome obstacles and provide this world with various solutions by integrating resources. For all of us, we need to hustle and have the mentality to absorb new knowledge and skills. Whenever your computer shows the notification to inform you of the recent version of IOS or windows, it is also a chance to remind yourself how long you have ever update yourself to become a better person. It is not telling you to compete with the 24-7 working machine, it is a mindset to keep us awaken from our laziness. Don’t stay in your comfort zone for too long, such as having a steady job, traditional thinking method and out-of-date knowledge. This generation is one of the best eras for entrepreneurs to start their business and workers to pursue their ideal career. All thanks to the available information and accessible courses online for pretty much whatever you would like to learn. Indeed, there are challenges which no generation has experience before; however, entrepreneurs and the young generation are ushering a new era of work and the diversity of business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uniform Lin</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-10-01 09:55:51', '2023-09-25 14:21:57', NULL),

The AI system analyzes capillaries\' changes on a user\'s face and collects heart-related data without any physical contact within six seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This technology relieves the discomfort of traditional wearable healthcare devices. It also provides more accurate data as the data collection is done without human interruption. Its reading precision reaches within three beats per minute, similar to the medical standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most cameras in the current market can support the system. Even if the camera\'s resolution is low, it won\'t affect FaceHeart\'s biosignal identification process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system also has a recording function that runs 24 hours straight to support home care. Apart from the elderly, this can be used for baby monitoring and patients with particular diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FaceHeart transitioned from a healthcare-only solution to a broader application in 2019. When FaceHeart received a series A funding from MediaTek, who considered the business a potential key player in the healthcare and fintech industries. Soon after the investment, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank announced a partnership with the company to repurpose the algorithm for use as a fraud detection tool. The collaboration and investment have led FaceHeart\'s value to an estimated NT$500 million (US$16 million).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through heartbeat detection, facial recognition, and emotion detection, FaceHeart\'s software can help the bank inspect users\' identity, prevent identity theft, and identify abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, the bank can deploy it to the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. The bank can weed out dummy accounts with face recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The driving force behind Faceheart</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wong Chun Yin, general manager of FaceHeart, revealed that money-making has never been its main drive. Everyone on the team is motivated by two goals: first, to alleviate the heavy burden of medical staff; and second, to revive the startup scene in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wong recalled that the startup scene at science parks in Taiwan was very vibrant 20 years ago. However, to this day, only TSMC and MediaTek are recognized by the public and outstanding graduates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that schools should seek partnerships with companies to push good technology forward to the market. The profits should return to the school, hence, building a self-sufficient ecosystem.\r\n	<br>Looking forward, FaceHeart aims to scale up algorithm development, adding two functions to its detection algorithm. It also seeks to partner with camera manufacturers to develop new solid hardware, offering flexibility for consumers and corporates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long term, Faceheart plans to continue investing its technology into medical sectors and to develop a new AI tool that can perform disease risk assessments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a><br></strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46937\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46937</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-10-06 09:15:45', '2020-10-06 09:15:45', NULL),

Abruptly, the audience stops eating, drinking, and chatting. Everyone turns toward the band to listen to the music. Some people even start to hum and sing along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The song that has caught everyone’s attention is <em>Hold My Hand</em>, a simple yet beautiful song from the early 1990s that touched Taiwanese people’s hearts when it was first released. The song’s lyrics depict a married couple’s persistence in facing life’s struggles, a theme that resonates with most people at the wedding banquet. As the pianist finishes his performance and walks off the stage, the audience are surprised to see he is not Taiwanese, admiring him for being able to express a traditional Taiwanese song in such an authentic way. The pianist is Martin Musaubach, an Argentinian immigrant who considers Taiwan his second home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/with%20Gary.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-inner\">Martin Musaubach perform</span></span></span>s with Gary</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Passion for music</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Musaubach, called Musa by friends, was born in 1982 and grew up in La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires Province. As a child, he received a small wooden piano toy as a gift from his grandmother and fell in love with the instrument immediately. Being from a lower-middle-class family, he did not have the resources to attend piano lessons consistently, so his musical training was often interrupted. “I never practiced, I just played and played. I had fun playing,” he said. For Musaubach, having fun is the only thing that’s important in music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He learned music mostly by listening. At the age of 12, a teacher recommended that he join a blues band, whose other members were almost 10 years older. With the band, he was able to perfect his skills in keyboard playing. The band served as a pivot in his adolescent life, providing him with significant emotional support, especially during the time of his parents’ divorce. After graduating from high school, his father wanted him to study law. However, after trying for four months, he gave up the idea of becoming a lawyer and went back to La Plata to work and study at a college to become a music teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, he entered a jazz band competition organized by a Hong Kong agency and won. He spent several years in the Greater China region, working as the band’s keyboard player. While touring and performing, he gained recognition and built a reputation for himself. In 2012, he met the renowned Taiwanese producer Michael Tu in Beijing, who invited him and his band to come to Taiwan to produce an album for a Taiwanese artist. Hence, he traveled to Taiwan and fell in love with its people and culture. Even though he had to overcome many obstacles, such as learning the language, getting used to the culture, and making a living, he still decided to settle in Taiwan. According to immigration law, he was required to make an investment and establish a business in Taiwan. Therefore, he founded the music production company 3690 Studio Ltd. in 2013. Due to the language barrier, cultural differences, and unfamiliarity with regulations, Musaubach had to rely on his Taiwanese friends for help. He also got significant assistance and advice from the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association with regard to setting up his company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/with%20Kids%20from%20Free%20Music%20Course.jpg.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"><span class=\"fr-inner\">Martin Musaubach with kids form free music course</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Giving back to society</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As a composer, arranger, performer, and teacher, Musaubach is very active in the music sector. He released his first album, titled <em>3690</em>, in 2013 and his multi-award-winning second album <em>All Kinds of Good</em> in 2017, which attracted a large fan base and had a significant impact. Besides actively collaborating with other artists, he also frequently tours internationally, giving performances and participating in jazz festivals. Several projects in particular were dear to his heart. He recorded the album <em>Kacalisiyan: Canción de la Cuesta</em> together with indigenous tribes, combining South American music with traditional Taiwanese indigenous songs. He also worked with the indigenous singer Aljenljeng Tjaluvie (Abao) and collaborated with P.i.N to form a duo called Indigo Soul Children, releasing the eponymous album <em>Indigo Soul Children</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After nine years working in Asia, mostly in Mandarin-speaking countries and especially in Taiwan, 2017 marked a turning point for Musaubach. He decided that it was time to give back to the society that had provided him with the freedom and stability to develop as an artist. Therefore, he wrote and established the Twentieth-Century Popular Music Course and started teaching the three-month-long music course to the public for free at Taipei Artist Village Cafe. Additionally, he also gave free jazz piano lessons to students in need. “I do not play and make music to become rich. I only take what is needed to take care of my family; the rest I gladly give back to society,” stated Musaubach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musaubach believes that education is the key to change the world, and in his own way, he is doing his part. “I am publishing a new, free book very soon, which I have been working on for almost three years and teaches students the importance of collaboration and how to make and produce popular music from scratch,” said Musaubach.

China Development Financial and Darwin Venture also participated in the round. iCHEF said it is planning an initial public offering (IPO).</p>In response to the slight drop in funding compared to 2016 when it garnered US$5.6 million (NT$162 million) in a Series A funding round led by AppWork, Ken Cheng, co-founder of iCHEF, explained: \"iCHEF\'s operation has become self-sufficient. We saw a growth opportunity, and we want to act upon it. The funding goal (US$5 million) is set after careful calculation.\"\r\n\r\n	<p>iCHEF\'s app consolidates all the major functions required for operating a restaurant such as table-management, orders and takeaways, promotions, and discounts, and the option of accepting various payment methods. When an order is made, it simultaneously goes to the printers of the corresponding workstations in a kitchen. The app also creates detailed reports about the performance of restaurants\' promotions and ordering trends. All data is automatically backed up to the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>iCHEF intends to use the fund to expand its research and development team and create more strategic partnerships with international platforms. Additionally, the company aims to focus on supporting small to middle-sized restaurants and strengthen food ordering websites and systems, customer service, the overall efficiency, and the function of customer relationship management.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Commenting on their investment, VC firm JAFCO Asia said, \"We hope our investment can support iCHEF to continue improving its user experience. We also hope to get them ready for potential mergers and acquisitions in the future and help them gain a strong foothold in the food and beverages tech industry.\"</p>\r\n	<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1602465543842.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-09/img-1601283768-48004@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-09/img-1601283768-48004@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-09/img-1601283768-48004@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"吳佳駿_iChef共同創辦人_程開佑_iChef共同創辦人_陳孝存_iChef財務長_2020_09\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">Photograph : 蔡仁譯</figure>\r\n\r\n	<p>In 2019, iCHEF partnered with Facebook to integrate Facebook\'s reward points collection model into its existing POS system. Customers do not need to download new apps or bring paper loyalty cards everywhere to collect restaurants\' dining points. They can give the cashier their phone number or scan the QR code on their receipts to save points on Facebook. For small restaurants, waiters can save time from dealing with customers on explaining how reward points work and focus on their main service, while owners can spend less time analyzing their reward points strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>With the rise of takeaway deliveries, the company also collaborated with UberEats, Lalamove, and Line to connect these food delivery platforms to the iCHEF app. Instead of going to every food delivery app to update the menu or cancel an order, restaurant managers can go to the iCHEF app to review all menu items and manage all customers\' orders from the dine-in restaurant and external platforms at once.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>\"From day one, iCHEF aims to grow with small local restaurants. We hope restaurant owners can put their time and energy on their food, and we take care of administrative tasks with our technology,\" Cheng said.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Looking forward, Cheng and iCHEF\'s co-founder Benjamin Wu are eyeing for an IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>\"I want to change the talent scene in Taiwan. The majority of outstanding local SaaS talents leave Taiwan to boost their career. I hope iCHEF can ultimately change this and retain the top talents by offering them a space to thrive,\" said Benjamin Wu, co-founder of iCHEF.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Meanwhile, Cheng hopes that iCHEF can become a brand people yearn for and a company that reminds people of \"anything is possible.\"</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>iCHEF, founded in 2012, currently has more than 8,000 restaurants across Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore.

During this 3-day activity, we learned, thrived, and exchanged ideas with 4,000 organizations from 45 countries. Aside from the summit this year, we believe more and more industries will seize the chance to integrate new technology and grow fast via digital transformation due to the impact of COVID-19. IN addition, the ongoing development of 5G Internet and lockdown limitations with border control will urge more international exhibitions and summits to transform into online interaction. To adapt to the new lifestyle in the post-pandemic era, online virtual interactive technology enables people to interact and exchange information simultaneously, breaking the physical limits of distance and reducing physical exposure or crowd gathering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reference:\r\n	<br><a href=\"http://ican-iaps.com.tw/news/ins.php?index_m_id=5&amp;index_id=139\">http://ican-iaps.com.tw/news/ins.php?index_m_id=5&amp;index_id=139</a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://cis.riseaccel.com/\">https://cis.riseaccel.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-10-21 08:55:26', '2023-09-25 14:20:46', NULL),

It already completed the first phase by launching advanced Whoscall services and conducting a survey of users\' responses, according to the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward, Gogolook aims to continue optimizing its products in response to the emergence of new scams on social media and communication apps. \"Maybe after three years, Whoscall will have very different solutions (for Japanese customers),\" Kuo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tapping opportunities in the FinTech sector</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The fresh capital from WIN Semiconductors will also be used to develop financial technology (FinTech) products, based on the concept of inclusive finance, according to Gogolook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September, Gogolook announced its first FinTech product Roo, a platform for users to compare personal credit loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through cooperation with six banks, the startup extends the application to its database and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to the product to avoid financial fraud. The six collaborative banks include Cathay, KGI, HSBC Taiwan, Citibank Taiwan, Standard Chartered and O-Bank, according to Roo\'s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gogolook said the product could help users, especially those who lack sufficient knowledge, identify their best loan options and alternatives. The platform, which has been in trial operation since March, also provides online person-to-person consulting services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The startup aims to create \"an ecosystem based on trust\" through innovative and user-centric designs, Kuo said <a href=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59329/roo.cash\" title=\"https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59329/roo.cash\">in another interview</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoscall currently has over 1.6 billion entries in its database of number information, the largest of its kind in East Asia. The app has accumulated over 80 million downloads worldwide since its launch, according to the startup\'s Chinese-language website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest cash injection came after Gogolook last year (2019) secured an undisclosed sum in investment from Cathay Sustainable Private Equity Fund in return for a 30 percent stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a><br></strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/47045\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/47045</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-11-09 07:54:26', '2020-11-09 07:54:54', NULL);

Alex Ma, founder of Daione, figured out how he could increase customers from other countries after the number of Chinese tourists shrank in 2015. He then started an online platform to match influencers with businesses. In the Thai market, he discovered 90% of customers would be affected by the Internet while 86% of Thai consumers would change their decisions based on articles or videos made by influencers on social media. With the focus of cross-border marketing, Daione uses high-frequency automation to match internet celebrities. Their clients include companies from several high-end industries, such as physical tourism stores and international leisure industry, etc. When facing international clients or corporate partners, Alex would conduct market research on their target customers in order to understand consumption pattern and expenditure in different areas. He then come up with various ideas for influencers to partner with his clients. On the other hand, he also helps Thai clients target Taiwanese consumers. In Taiwan, internet celebrities bring a big impact on marketing. Companies utilize content to attract consumers first by providing product info via internet celebrities. It then trigger purchase depending on consumers’ trust in the influencers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1606212782559.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following session, the business deputy director of STARTBOARD Edison Hsueh, explained that STARTBOARD is a one-stop startup service that provides startups with services on visas, taxes, legal service, governmental resources, office space, investment reminders, etc. He also shared tips on starting a business abroad as well as domestically. In the past three years, with the characteristic of civil diplomacy organization, STARTBOARD has assisted over 30 ASEAN startups to land in Taiwan. When ASEAN startups intend to enter Taiwan, they would intuitively think of STARTBOARD by word of mouth. Edison also talked about the latest trend in the Thai market. Thailand is the first country that operates 5G service in ASEAN -- even earlier than Taiwan!! Thai telecommunication companies combined 5G with AI and robots. They built up a reputation and caught attention from international media. This shows that Thai market actually has more potential and technology capability than we used to think. However, finding potential clients, creating service beyond cultural understanding, and integrating different technologies would be the key for startups to penetrate a new market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1606212809355.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the sharing session, the participants brought up several questions in the FAQ session. How do you select the first target country for cross-border business? How do you modify operating models for the tourism industry based on the pandemic? According to Alex, statistics is a critical tool. Companies can check the country’s GDP in proportion to certain industries. For example, Daione targeted Thailand mainly because tourism revenue accounts for around 14% of its GDP. For industries related to tourism, it goes up to around 22%. Aside from business transformation and modification, Edison said adjusting mindset during the pandemic can lead to new business models. Meanwhile, this is a prime moment for global industries to transform digitally, which can be a compelling business opportunity for Taiwanese startups to create new services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1606212828760.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1606212862870.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the following one-on-one private professional consultations with investors, we invited Manager Peng from DIT Startup, Partner Weng from Smart Capital, and Manager Liu from United Daily News Group.

When I invest or work with entrepreneurs, I look for some hacker energy,” she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fontenot agreed that the most common perception of a hacker, which refers to those writing codes or breaking into a computer system, is a very narrow view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Hacker is more of a mindset,” he said.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1607303918003.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1606889903-98573@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1606889903-98573@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1606889903-98573@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"Meet Global Salon\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n	<figcaption>Dave Fontenot, General Partner at Backend Capital. Now he invests in brilliant engineers as early as possible. / Photograph: Meet</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a good hacker, Wu said one has to understand the rules of the game very well in order to bend the rules. If a hacker can’t understand that, he or she cannot be a good one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She noticed that the education system in Taiwan reinforces obedience and compliance, and she proposed encouraging a cultural shift in the city in which people play by the rules and master the rules so they can create their own new rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commenting on the startup scene in Taiwan, Fortenot said it is very different from that in the Silicon Valley and not necessarily in a good way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Susan and I were taking a walk individually before the conference. I noticed that not many founders tried to engage me in any ways. In Silicon Valley, when I see hackers at a conference,they’re pushing every limit of the rules at the conference to get the attention of the people walking by,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu echoed his sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Every opportunity is a conversion point. Every single interaction is a conversation point. You should be mastering and manipulating those conversion points as much as you can,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One of the important things startups in Taiwan can do is start pitching to the Daves and me.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing Fontenot and Wu noticed about Taiwan’s startup scene is that hackers focus too much on their technology feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“What really strikes me about the startup ecosystem here is that there’s a lack of the ability of productization. There are a lot of descriptions and features of the technology. The startups may have really fantastic technology here but I wouldn’t be able to tell based on the stories that these startups are telling about their products,” Wu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She cited a compelling story as key to success. She elaborated a good pitch should answer these questions: How are you going to change the future of the world? Why would I get excited about this either as a customer or an investor? How are you going to change my life as a human being living in the world? How are you going to change the world economy and ecosystem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’re ultimately human beings. As Donald Trump has shown and as all these other populist movements have shown, we want to be moved emotionally by everything, whether it is science or technology or products. We want to be moved and touched emotionally,” she explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, Fontenot said startups in Taiwan should focus more on their users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The top founders in Silicon Valley are so focused on their users. They are constantly telling me who are going to use their product or if some people have already been using their product, how it changed their lives, or how it will change my life as a user,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, Wu said now is a great time to become a hacker or an investor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I first started in Silicon Valley, there weren’t many role models. The companies are very traditional white-shoe VC firms with a fairly conservative way of doing things. It was only with the rise of micro VCs and with the incubators and the very powerful individual angel investors, then the culture started to change,” she reflected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are many different paths for succeeding in Silicon Valley today that didn\'t exist previously.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continued saying that 2020 is a great year for female hackers as well. Female hackers can be the most effective hackers because nobody is going to expect them as a hacker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You can present as Sheryl Sandberg (CEO of Facebook) or President Tsai, and you can be the most powerful hacker in the world because no one is expecting it. They’re not going to see it coming,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45995\"></a><br></strong><a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/47127\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/47127</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2020-12-07 01:20:01', '2020-12-07 01:49:48', NULL),

Numbers Protocol solves this by providing tools to help users create tamper-proof records of media content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers Protocol, the only company in Taiwan certified by both OpenChain 2.0 and MyData Operator, was recently selected by Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) as one of the 100 startups from Taiwan to be showcased at CES 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Addressing the ‘seeing is no longer believing’ dilemma is the top motivation and priority of Numbers. We developed an image traceability framework that includes Capture, Seal, and Trace,” says Tammy Yang, Founder and Co-CEO of Numbers Protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company built three products within its traceability framework. The Numbers Capture app records the birth information of an item of media content at the point of creation and generates a certificate with a unique signature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers Seal API uses blockchain technology to seal that item’s birth information and change-logs with immutable records. Numbers Trace API and dashboard service tracks the asset content footprint at every level from creation to archive, and plays an integral role in reducing the effort required for verification. All media content created using Numbers Capture comes with a unique certification ID. When this content is shared, viewers can scan a QR code to review and verify.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Capture digital images like a normal app with security and traceability features</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Users operate Capture like any other mobile camera application. When a picture is taken, the app will automatically record the time, location, photographer, and other metadata to create a unique birth certificate for image traceability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An additional feature of the Capture app is the PostCapture function, which allows users to generate unique digital image “postcards”. These postcards are digital assets that users have full ownership of, ensured by the blockchain. These assets can be shared and, like any postcard, the ownership may be effectively transferred. We hope that Capture App’s PostCapture feature can help to reinstate uniqueness and value to original photographic works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Transparency and open-source</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers Protocol has always worked to protect the privacy of users while they use their phones. For instance, the company developed an app that helps track COVID-related symptoms of patients while preventing cloud collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the only three MyData operators in Asia, Numbers helps users own their own data and regain control of their personal data. Most of the products created by Numbers Protocol are open-sourced, bringing additional transparency to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A team that shines</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers Protocol is led by Tammy Yang who earned her PhD in Physics from the University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology. Yang earned her bachelor\'s degree in Physics from National Taiwan University. Prior to founding Numbers, Yang was a co-founder and deep learning researcher at DT42, a technology company focused on AI &amp; deep learning, where she researched algorithms to make deep learning models lighter and faster.

The objective conditions in the past show that the challenges of developing eSport in India include insufficient infrastructure, unaffordable hardware equipment, and unsupported culture and family. But after 2020, India is about to usher in the development of eSport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, insufficient infrastructure is no longer the biggest obstacle to the development of eSport in India. Taiwan\'s ASUS brand \"ROG\" has also become the only official partner of India for the first designated equipment. An interesting phenomenon in India is that it may directly enter the \"mobile eSport ecosystem\" and skip the \"computer eSport\" related games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/%E5%9C%96%E7%89%87%201.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\">(picture from 91mobile)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online video games are inseparable from eSports in terms of growth factors. In eSports, the players tend to cherish their career as professional or amateur video game players which motivates them to actively participate in tournaments. Therefore, a high level of recognition in multi-player videogames is indeed essential for eSports industry. Looking into the growth of the online game players in India, the industry predicts a positive shift. Many industries have been affected due to COVID19. However, the lockdown became a thriving factor for the eSports industry. Housebound people are driving to accept a new model of engagement through eSports. And around 35% higher usage has been noticed in multi-player modes in online gaming. Many eSports platforms have reported double-digit growth in the user base during the lockdown. For example, Paytm First Games has reported an almost 200% increase. This new addition to the sports industry is well greeted since 2019. We can even say that this is a \'paradigm shift\' in the Indian sports industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India is a lucrative market for FDI with 75% of its population under the age of 45 and the second-largest online market. Investors need to adhere to all the relevant regulations in India during collaborations. Considering the spectrum of the consequences, several laws indirectly regulate this complex industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intellectual property is one of the most important concerns in the eSports world. It is crucial to receive proper authorization or license from the appropriate personnel. Make sure that your intellect is properly shielded with IP protection in an adequate form of IP such as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, etc. Otherwise, IP infringement can cost a fortune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, the Public Gambling Act is the most influential law in eSports industry. Since the Act is a State Subject, therefore, the regulations may vary from state to state. However, Indian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) prohibit any kind of investment or collaboration for foreigners in lottery, gambling, betting field, and even in technology. Therefore, it would be wise to understand the regulations surrounding your investment. The Information Technology Act further regulates the electronic transmission of gambling information too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maintain morality, decency, and to avoid provocative contents, this industry is regulated by many other laws such as The Code of Advertising Standards Council of India to control the content of the advertisement in the eSports industry, The Information Technology Rules which control the transmission of information, and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from legality, negotiating power has become the foremost concern in this industry. A careful review of the contract becomes essential for any type of investment and collaboration. Terms in the player\'s agreement also cause disputes and effects employment. Therefore, considering drafting contracts by professional corporate lawyers would be a smart choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more recognition, countries might strive to enact specific laws to regulate the industry. With these evolving law changes, our society would demand proficient eSports lawyers soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is also currently having great eSports recognition. Therefore, Taiwanese and Indian collaborators walking hand in hand would be a win-win scenario. It is also an opportunity for startups who focus on eSports industry.</p>', NULL, 1, '2021-01-03 13:08:13', '2023-09-25 14:18:10', NULL);

Lisa Lo, partner of CID group, added timing is also important, in addition to giving the right advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three panelists listed gender differences and cultural shock as some of the challenges they had encountered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Being a venture capitalist, we need to see every challenge as a positivity,” Lo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We should be doing what is right, instead of doing what is expected. Sometimes we may try to partition ourselves into a female or non-female thing to do but we shouldn’t do that. Only flash drives need partitioning,” Huang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yang said they are always looking for founders that are already thinking through all the journeys in the upcoming five to ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our first questions usually are: Why do you want our money? Why do you want to be our partner?” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang advised startups to look for an investor that resonates with them.\r\n	<br>“Looking for an investor should be like looking for your future spouse. You are not looking for someone that is the richest or has the biggest muscles.

(from right on)</figcaption>Anchor Taiwan</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>To score a highly sought-after deal, Tsou said flaunting capital is not the key to winning. Alternatively, investors need to show the startup their “true value.” Hwang added the role of venture capital or private equity is similar to a salesperson’s, so investors need to think about their value-added in order to stand out from their competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu said the next thing to do after making an investment is to help the founders find the next investors and secure their Series B fundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My experience is that most of the funding processes are painful. There are a lot of back and forth introductions, inquiries, and rejections. What we can do is to leverage all of our networks to help them secure any kind of investors that might be suitable for their portfolio. Of course, luck is also an important factor in all investment, “ Liu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have to trust your founders. Once you bet on them, you have to trust them and help them cope with all the troubles. You have to try all the means you can get to help them survive the most painful part.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the common mistakes founders or CEOs make is the lack of focus, as cited by Liu and Hwang, and it is an investor’s job to help them bring back the focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Founders tend to be dreamers and pathbreakers. They are very creative. It is easy for them to be distracted by other things, for example, attending useless events or PR sessions. As an investor, it is essential to drag them back to the track. We need to make sure they are always pushing their products and delivering the next version of the product because only users can give them feedback, which decides whether the company will succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tsou added that many founders or CEOs try to do everything by themselves.

While speed and delivery are fundamental in the startup world, she said an investor ought to give founders space to test out their hypothesis and learn from both the success and failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanna Yang from CTBC group, who was also a product manager before, agreed the work experience had become an advantage for her to grow her investment portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As investors, we need to ask the right questions, for example, whether the founder is the right person to lead the team,” she said. Lisa Lo, partner of CID group, added timing is also important, in addition to giving the right advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three panelists listed gender differences and cultural shock as some of the challenges they had encountered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Being a venture capitalist, we need to see every challenge as a positivity,” Lo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We should be doing what is right, instead of doing what is expected. Sometimes we may try to partition ourselves into a female or non-female thing to do but we shouldn’t do that. Only flash drives need partitioning,” Huang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yang said they are always looking for founders that are already thinking through all the journeys in the upcoming five to ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our first questions usually are: Why do you want our money? Why do you want to be our partner?” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang advised startups to look for an investor that resonates with them.\r\n	<br>“Looking for an investor should be like looking for your future spouse. You are not looking for someone that is the richest or has the biggest muscles. It should be about whether he understands your vision, whether you can communicate with him and trust him, and whether he has the integrity you value,” Huang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Common mistake and what should an investor do</strong>\r\n	<br>Sunshene Tsou from Taiwania Capital, Angela Liu from Cherubic Ventures, and Cathy Hwang from Zumaya Equity, further elaborated the essence of an investor.</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1610934554742.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 900w\" title=\"\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\" data-result=\"success\">\r\n	<figcaption>The panel on \"Drive Greater ROI Across your Portfolio\" featured the 4 speakers, Angela Liu from Cherubic Ventures, Sunshene Tsou from Taiwania Capital, Cathy Hwang from Zumaya Equity and Angela Liu from Cherubic Ventures. (from right on)</figcaption>Anchor Taiwan</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>To score a highly sought-after deal, Tsou said flaunting capital is not the key to winning. Alternatively, investors need to show the startup their “true value.” Hwang added the role of venture capital or private equity is similar to a salesperson’s, so investors need to think about their value-added in order to stand out from their competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu said the next thing to do after making an investment is to help the founders find the next investors and secure their Series B fundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“My experience is that most of the funding processes are painful. There are a lot of back and forth introductions, inquiries, and rejections. What we can do is to leverage all of our networks to help them secure any kind of investors that might be suitable for their portfolio. Of course, luck is also an important factor in all investment, “ Liu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You have to trust your founders. Once you bet on them, you have to trust them and help them cope with all the troubles. You have to try all the means you can get to help them survive the most painful part.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the common mistakes founders or CEOs make is the lack of focus, as cited by Liu and Hwang, and it is an investor’s job to help them bring back the focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Founders tend to be dreamers and pathbreakers. They are very creative. It is easy for them to be distracted by other things, for example, attending useless events or PR sessions. As an investor, it is essential to drag them back to the track. We need to make sure they are always pushing their products and delivering the next version of the product because only users can give them feedback, which decides whether the company will succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tsou added that many founders or CEOs try to do everything by themselves. They are smart but they don’t know how to delegate responsibilities to the people they hiring. Investors should be supportive and remind founders if such a situation occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hwang pointed out another form of ‘lack of focus’ as the incompetence of identifying their customer base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There aren’t too many levers for startups to survive.

International media recognizes Taiwan\'s Covid-19 response. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-resilience-ranking/\">Bloomberg has ranked Taiwan as No. 2</a> for the best place to be in the Covid-19 era, and <a href=\"https://time.com/5851633/best-global-responses-covid-19/\">Times Magazine also mention Taiwan</a> as having the best global response to the Covid-19 pandemics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two reasons combined, the safest place in the world and the Employment Gold Card, Taiwan has gained huge success in recruiting international experts last year. \"In the middle of last year, the NDC issued 800 Gold Card. Now it is top 2000,\" said Ming-Hsin Kung. It is apparent global talents are paying more attention to Taiwan now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Startup Island Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For letting the world feel the vibration of Taiwan\'s startup community, NDC teamed up with hundreds of local venture capitals, startup accelerators, and launched the national startup brand of Taiwan - <a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45893\">Startup Island TAIWAN.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1613531651404.jpeg\" alt=\"Startup Island Taiwan.jpeg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>Photograph : National Development Council</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Taiwan has been ranked as a \"super innovator\" with Germany, Switzerland, and the US in the latest Global Competitiveness Report, says Mei-Ling Chen, former NDC minister. According to 2019 <a href=\"https://www.gemconsortium.org/\">Global Entrepreneurship Monitorreport</a>, the country stands as one of the best environments to start a company among fifty economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Startup Island TAIWAN will play a role for the startup community to keep broadcasting the world the ambition and capabilities of Taiwan startup companies and keep seeking international cooperation opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47298\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47322\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47322</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-02-17 03:18:11', '2023-09-25 14:17:47', NULL),

People go to Silicon Valley to change the world with their business plan, on the other hand, venture capitalists swarm into Silicon Valley for finding the next unicorn startups.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>But now, the situation is slightly changing; the number of unicorn startups outside the US has been growing bigger and bigger. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1096928/number-of-global-unicorns-by-country/\">According to the data from the statista</a>, the number of unicorn startups in the US in January 2020 is 265, but the country with the second most, China, already accumulated 204 unicorn startups. If we combine China, UK, India, Germany, and South Korea, the number of unicorns would be 273, which tops the US.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Obviously, in these years, more VC dollars are invested outside the U.S. and there are more unicorns being created outside the U.S. \"The next stage of venture capital going global happens to pass through where 500 Startups is the strongest,\" Tony Wang said.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>500 Startups co-founder and CEO, Christine Tsai, decided to bet on startups around the globe instead of only focusing on Silicon Valley at a very early time. \"It was contrarian to invest outside Silicon Valley back 11 years ago when 500 Startups was founded, but her vision paid off. Today, 500 has a very huge global network. It\'s very hard to be replicated by others, and this is also the main reason I wanted to join 500 Startups,\" Tony Wang said.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><a href=\"https://500.co/blog/welcome-tony-wang/\">According to Christine Tsai\'s blog post</a>, in 2019 the startups they invested outside the US already accounted for 49% of their portfolio. Now 500 Startups\' portfolio has expanded to 77 countries, and 19 startups they invested in had become unicorn, including Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab, online course platform Udemy, and design platform Canva.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1613532355847.jpeg\" alt=\"500Startups_profolio.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47323\">500 Starups invested in unicorns including Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab, online course platform Udemy, and design platform Canva. / Photograph : 500Startups\r\n\r\n	<h2>Targeting helps Taiwan software startups go to the global market</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>500 Startups has been good at digging investment opportunities around the world, and this time they spotted the potential of software ecosystem in Taiwan. \"Taiwan has very strong technical talents in software industry. People usually think Taiwan is good at manufacturing electronics, and sure Taiwan already has a very solid hardware ecosystem, but actually we can not ignore the software talents here anymore,\" Tony Wang mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Tony Wang said confidently, \"People might question whether this is too early for investing software in Taiwan. The software ecosystem here has not mature yet. But as venture capitalists, we always need to foresee the future, we always need to grab the chance to be ahead others.”</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>There are already lots of VC from Silicon Valley that have started their accelerator program here many years ago. What different resource can 500 Startups bring to Taiwan? Tony Wang mentioned again that 500 Startups has been building global network for over 11 years, and that\'s hard to be copied. Their main accelerator back at headquarters in Silicon Valley gathered teams from all over the world, and Tony is eagerly looking for Taiwanese startups to join them, to learn from others founders, and to gain international point of view.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1613532357132.jpeg\" alt=\"500 Startups_accelerator\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47323\">500 Startups flagship seed program in San Francisco gathering teams from around the world. / Photograph : 500Startups</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47323\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47323\">“I value the founders who have 3 + 1 characteristics. First, the founders should at least be very good at one skill, no matter if it’s technical or something else. Second, they should know how to build a team. Third, they need to be resilient, and the +1 is speed. It is okay to make mistakes, but they should fix it fast,” Tony Wang said.</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47323\">\r\n\r\n	<p>As 500 Startups sets up a new office here in Taiwan, they are hiring local team members at the same time.

After the two-month-long intensive interview and selection process, the MOEA organized the opening ceremony for the first echelon in northern Taiwan, to respond to the support of Microsoft Taiwan, and in central Taiwan, for Victor Taichung Machinery Works, on December 14, 2020. The opening ceremony was brimming with youthful enthusiasm and vitality. Minister of Science and Technology and Deputy Convener of the Board of Science and Technology (BOST) of the Executive Yuan Wu Tsung-Tsong, Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan Audrey Tang, and MOEA Chief Secretary Chen Yi-Ling showed their support by joining the opening ceremony together from the two venues through live streaming. Their participation demonstrates that the government cares about and has high expectations for T Ambassadors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital transformation has become a significant challenge for this century, on which the COVID-19 pandemic has effected a critical impact. The T Ambassador Program was created by the Executive Yuan\'s Office of Science and Technology to devise directions for talent cultivation and development, with the aim of quickening the pace of digital transformation among industries in the cloud era. The Program trains new graduates as seed talent for industrial digital transformation to help industry position itself for digital transformation, develop innovative business models, and enhance industrial competitiveness. The SMEA aims to facilitate the practice of digital transformation among companies through this Program. In addition to the interview and selection process, young applicants were required to pass the aptitude test and career competency assessment. After which, they were coached by mentors who have experience in international business management in devising and planning the direction and tasks of digital transformation for businesses. Moreover, the participants took part in a two-week intensive training course in northern, central, southern, and eastern Taiwan, as well as a 24-week hands-on practice of industrial digital transformation. Through training, these young participants built momentum for digital transformation, integrated industrial knowledge and skills into practical cases, and also closely interacted with companies\' core decision-makers of digital transformation during the training. So far, more than 2,000 applicants have applied for posts as T Ambassadors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today is the joint opening ceremony of the first echelon, a total of 120 participants who passed the interview process. In support of the central themes of digital transformation and local training and dissemination, the opening ceremony was held in northern and central Taiwan and was live streamed. The trainees were also invited to visit the two supporting enterprises of the Program- Microsoft Taiwan and Victor Taichung. As the training kicked off, the trainees had a chance to thoroughly experience what a company needs to embark on a digital transformation journey and also learn about potential applications from best practice cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the support from businesses, MOST Minister and BOST Deputy Convener of the Executive Yuan Wu Tsung-Tsong and MOEA Chief Secretary Chen Yi-Lin joined the opening ceremony in northern Taiwan, while Audrey Tang, Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan, was a highlight in her role as \"Audrey Cat\"&nbsp;at the venue in central Taiwan. In the opening remarks, Minister Wu, Minister without Portfolio Tang, and Chief Secretary Chen all encouraged T Ambassadors to contribute what they have learned and to help develop industrial digital transformation. After the opening ceremony, the three officials amiably joined the group photo session with participants. Due to the precautions for COVID-19, the event organizer thoughtfully prepared masks printed with \"Audrey Cat\"&nbsp;images for attendees, making the opening ceremony even more special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The T Ambassador Program targets university and college students who are soon to graduate (those who graduate before June 2021 and have to submit their diplomas before completion of training) or people who graduated in three years\' time and are in-between jobs (those who graduated after January 1, 2017). Recruitment for the Program will continue until December 27, 2020.

The team said more than 80% of people exercise regularly in Taiwan, yet they still have two pain points. The first one is the lack of diversity in sports which the public can get access to. The truth is that there are many more interesting sports awaiting to be discovered by the public. The second issue is that many athletes can\'t live by coaching after they retire. If no one guides them during their transition, most athletes are left to choose a job that has nothing to do with their sports.

For solving the trust issue in transactions, Satoshi Nakamoto developed the blockchain that the data can barely be altered on it. Since then, people have started to leverage the power of blockchain to tackle the trust issue in different industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, adding data to the blockchain causes too much time, which means it is still hard to apply this technology. Targeting this problem, ITM Chief Scientist &amp; Co-Founder professor Gwan-Hwan Hwang led the technical team to successfully develop the Transaction Positioned Merkle Tree algorithm, which can tremendously lower the time for adding data to the blockchain. \"Because of the data structure of blockchain, usually querying data in blockchain will be 500 to 1000 times slower than querying data in the traditional database,\" Julian Chen said. \"For example, last time I heard a blockchain company told me that they need 15 minutes to search for one piece of data.

William set up MOX here in Taiwan, a mobile-only accelerator, to connect all the mobile companies together.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Technology analyst who knows the Asian market the best</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>William Bao Bean forged an indissoluble bond with Taiwan as early as his graduation year. As soon as he graduated from college in the US, he came to Taiwan to work as a researcher at the American Institute In Taiwan (AIT), which is the de facto embassy of the US in Taiwan and owned by the US Department of Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Taiwan\'s semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries starting to boom at that time, the experience to work in Taiwan not only consolidated William\'s understanding of the technology industry but also intrigued his interest in the Asian technology market. He foresaw that the Asian market can not be neglected in the future, and planted a seed in his heart to bring him back to Asia after leaving several years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-04/img-1617939852-19475.jpg\" alt=\"William Bao Bean_General Partner at SOSV\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>25 years ago, William work in Taiwan as a tech analyst. The experience eventually leads William to bring the accelerator back to Taiwan. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later, William went back to Wall Street to work as a tech researcher at investment bank Bear Stearns, which, at that time, had the top-ranked PC &amp; hardware analysis in the world. With his understanding of Taiwanese and Asian technology industries, William kept discovering potential tech companies from Asia for the western investors. He built a reputation among institutional investors for his familiarity with the Asian technology market and attracted SoftBank Group to hire him for investing in this market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Helped several Asian companies\' IPO and spotted the internet booming there.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 2002 to 2014, William kept honing his vision by making one after another successful investment in Asia. He spotted the potential of Alibaba, which later became an e-commerce giant in China. He spent two years introducing Alibaba to western investors. Furthermore, he arranged for former President Bill Clinton to come to Hangzhou for a feast with Jack Ma. Eventually, he helped Alibaba achieve the IPO successfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only did he invest in China, William\'s investment portfolio was across the whole Asian market. He invested in Peacesoft - a Vietnam eCommerce and payment platform backed by eBay, GMobi - a mobile platform from Taiwan, and Massive Impact - an Israel mobile advertising startup later acquired by GMobi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of his achievements in investing, he was ranked No.1 stock picker in technology, media, and telecom in Hong Kong/China by Forbes, and ranked top 3 All-Asia analyst for Technology/Software by Institutional Investor Magazine Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through one after another investment across Asia, William felt that the internet was definitely taking off there and he should get on the train. At first, he planned to bring Google\'s business model directly to here, which means building an advertisement platform that lets internet startups promote their business. But, his knowledge of Asia told him that simply copying Google\'s business model did not fit in this market, he needed to reshape it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-04/img-1617939916-91504.jpg\" alt=\"William Bao Bean_General Partner at SOSV, Managing\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>William talks about building a revenue sharing based internet ecosystem in Taiwan. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of building a Google-like advertisement platform, William thought of building an advertisement platform that is based on revenue sharing. Startups would not pay for posting ads, but only pay when the ads bring back revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MOX, a mobile only accelerator but also a revenue-sharing advertisement ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the opportunity for building his idea came to William. SOSV, a multi-stage venture capital firm with US$855 million under management and more than 1000 companies in their portfolio, invited William to join as a general partner and target the growing mobile internet populations in Asia to set up an accelerator. Lots of countries popped up from his mind, but after careful consideration, he decided Taiwan is the best suitable place to be a hub for the potential 4 billion mobile internet users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I could set the accelerator anywhere, but I think Taiwan has an unfair advantage compared to other countries, and that is engineering talents. People might say China has lots of mobile internet users, why not set up in China? Well, China\' engineers are too expensive, and for Southeast Asia, there do not have enough talents on the technical side,\" William said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, William set up <a href=\"https://mobileonlyx.com/\">MOX</a>, which means a mobile-only accelerator. William planned to include two kinds of startups in MOX. One is the startup\'s mobile application is sticky but may not make a lot of money, and the other is the startup\'s mobile application is making a lot of money but is not sticky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-03/img-1615518480-58507.jpg\" alt=\"MOX demo day\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>William host the 10th MOX demo day, the seven startups pitched that day doing up to US$1 million in monthly revenue. / Photograph : MOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these two kinds of startups in the MOX, William would let startups cross-promote for each other. The sticky applications can help promote other profitable apps, once the profitable apps make more money from promotions, it is reasonable to share some revenue back to the sticky apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each batch in MOX is 6 months, and they had held their 10th demo day this year. Once the mobile startups join MOX, they will get a US$100K-$120k investment, and the opportunity guided by over 350 mentors from MOX, but most importantly, the startups can be promoted to the MOX ecosystem that has over 100 million smartphone users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first three and half years, startups in MOX, which include 15 apps, only got 6 million active users. But then, MOX’s active users grow from 6 million to 50 million in the next half year. Furthermore, it grows from 50 million to 102 million to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It\'s been a tough ride at first. But later the growing numbers prove we are in the right direction. Our goal for the next 5 years is to grow the active users to over 1 billion across the world and be the top ten global internet ecosystems,\" said William.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-03/img-1614909207-43688.jpg\" alt=\"MOX_Demo_Day_1\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOX keeps attracting startups from around the world to come to Taiwan. / Photograph : MOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During these five years, MOX attracts numerous startups from around the world to come to Taiwan, and help seven startups relocate to Taiwan including <a href=\"https://www.italki.com/\">italki</a> and <a href=\"https://snapask.com/\">snapask</a>, which strengthening the interaction between Taiwan and international.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"From my point of view, the key for Taiwanese startups to grow big is to sell outside Taiwan, and that\'s what MOX can help with.

(381, 'What to learn before venturing Indonesian market | STARTBOARD Indonesia Theme Night in Taipei', '2021-05-31', 'southeastasia', '<p>Having a huge domestic market and rich resources has made Indonesia the largest economy in ASEAN and the fourth most populous country in the world. Besides having a high population of migrant workers, there is also plenty of Indonesian students studying in Taiwan. To encourage people who are interested in the Indonesian market to have a better understanding of the startup environment, STARTBOARD held the Indonesia Theme night on 26th March 2021. The event was a success with many distinguished guests attending the event, including Budi Santoso (Representative of Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia), Ali Fauzi (Director of the Investment Department), Yudha Tri Utama (Analyst of Investment Department), SUNSINO VENTURE GROUP, and Indonesian Students’ Association of National Taiwan University. STARTBOARD has also invited few Indonesian entrepreneurs in Taiwan who have in-depth knowledge of the Indonesian market. Huang Hsien-Cheng, the co-founder of Alson Retail and Tuku online, shared his startup experience about E-commerce as an entrepreneur. Secondly, Wen Fu-Shun, General Manager of Leyun in Indonesia, introduced the process of bringing Taiwanese brands crossing the border to Indonesia and the future trends in cloud service. Last but not least, Wu Chun-Hsing, the founder of ISheEra, shared his experience in selling Taiwanese brands to Indonesia and the differences between both markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prospects of Indonesia Market and Opportunities for Taiwanese Companies</strong><strong><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C2.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There is rapid economic growth and rising opportunities in the Indonesian market. Not to mention the Indonesian government has promulgated “omnibus Clause” and “Omnibus Law RUU Cipta Kerja” to shorten the time for foreign companies to obtain a business license. Thus, I am confident to say the economic cooperation between Taiwan and Indonesia will continue its growth throughout the New Southbound Policy. It is yet too late to invest!” said Budi Santoso, Representative of Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia, wishing STARTBOARD Indonesia Theme Night could be the communicative bridge between Indonesia and Taiwan at his opening speech.\r\n	<br><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C3.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, Yudha Tri Utama, Analyst of investment department, Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia, shared the upcoming trends in the Indonesian economy. He mentioned the Indonesian market has some great market advantages, including huge populations and ample international talents, which has made Indonesia the fifth-largest startup market in the world. In addition, the government has prompted a new policy, which allows foreign enterprises more flexibility in entering the Indonesian market. Ali Fauzi, the Director of the Investment Department, Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia, added: “ The current policies not only subsidies the foreign companies, but also eased the restrictions of industry categories that are allowed to trade in Indonesia. In the past, there were about 350 industry categories restricted. Now, 300 of these industries are allowed to make investments or management, leaving only 46 industries left with limitations.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C4.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Venturing into E-commerce isn’t that hard.

Huang Hsien-Cheng came to Taiwan after realizing the importance of learning Chinese. However, throughout his experience from school and his part-time job, he decided to start Alson Retail, the first Indonesian online shop in Taiwan. Alson Retail sells necessities to Indonesians in Taiwan and has expanded rapidly through precision marketing via social media. Huang Hsien-Cheng is now building his second e-commerce platform Tuku Online, which is going to sell products from his hometown. “Start small. Dig deep. Think Big. Just start!” he encouraged the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Opportunities in Cloud Service Nowadays</strong><strong><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C7.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Lifestreaming is no longer just live streaming.” said Wen Fu-Shun, the General Manager of Leyun in Indonesia at the beginning of his speech. Nowadays, live streaming has been widely used in different fields, from learning, meeting, a concert to even medical care. Leyun supplies complete, professional, one-stop, and 24-hour online service. Furthermore, it has expanded overseas based on its experiences in Taiwan. At this moment, Leyun is targeting the market demand in live streaming in Indonesia with competitive advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can Taiwanese brands boost their sales in Indonesia by social media?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C8.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></strong>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu Chun-Hsing, the founder of ISheEra and an influencer with over 20,000 followers on Facebook, has been focusing on introducing Taiwanese goods to Indonesia. He shared how he utilized social media influencer marketing in growing businesses from his personal experiences. Nowadays, influencer marketing and sponsored post is no longer something new or fresh in the Taiwanese market, however, the marketing strategy still works among Indonesian customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, he pointed out the mistakes these companies often make. Most of them have great products but they don’t understand the differences in consumer behavior within the local market. Therefore, he suggested: “If you want to enter the Indonesian market, you need a partner who fully understands the Indonesian consumers.” Taiwan is generally not informative in the Indonesian market, finding a reliable local partner can avoid big mishaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/%E5%8D%B0%E5%B0%BC%E4%B9%8B%E5%A4%9C9.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the event, founder of STARTBOARD, Uniform Lin mentioned: “The population of southeast Asians in Taiwan has grown rapidly these years. This event not only created a platform for Indonesian and Taiwanese to connect but also introduced the startup ecosystem to the audiences. In the future, STARTBOARD will continue in assisting Indonesians starting their businesses in Taiwan and supporting Taiwanese teams in the search of Indonesian talents!”</p>', NULL, 1, '2021-05-31 10:10:20', '2023-09-25 14:13:58', NULL),

They host an online exhibition called \"<a href=\"https://www.computextaipei.com.tw/en/exhibitor/show-area-grid/Garage+%2046%20Must-See%20Startups/list.html\">Garage+ 46 Must-See</a>\" inside Computex through the incubator Garage+ to showcase the startups.</p>\r\n\r\n				<p>inPhocal, selected as one of the \"Garage+ 46 Must-See\", is a Netherland startup that developed breakthrough laser technology to accelerate the efficiency of the marking industry.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h2>Marking industry\'s wasting problem</h2>\r\n\r\n				<p>People consume a tremendous amount of beverages around the world every year, and it is normal to see beverage cans and bottles everywhere. Especially in summer, it becomes part of life that when people get thirsty, they just grab a bottle of Coke or Pepsi and drink it. According to the data, there are 2.7 billion cans and bottles produced per day in the world. Although governments have enacted laws to ask people to recycle empty bottles and cans, wasting inkjet printing to mark texts on the bottles is another huge problem that everyone ignores.</p>\r\n\r\n				<p>Traditionally, in the bottles and cans production line, factories use inkjet printing instead of laser to mark the texts because inkjet is much faster than laser. Current laser marking systems cannot work as quickly as inkjet to mark the same sized surfaces, and the one reason is that laser systems have a short focus. But using inkjet printing comes at a price, Inkjet printing equipment needs constant cleaning and maintenance, furthermore, marking the texts would need a high cost of consumables inks: 160 million liters of ink for inkjet inside production lines yearly, which is eco-unfriendly.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1623117130114.jpeg\" alt=\"inPhocal\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n			<p data-aid=\"47391\">Inkjet needs constant cleaning and maintenance.

Taking a magnifier as an example, some children like to burn leaves with a magnifier, and the leaves would only be burned when the magnifier\'s focal point aligned with the surface of leaves. Unlike standard laser beams that lose their focus quickly, sometimes within 1mm, this advanced laser system can maintain a focused spot at a distance 400 times longer than conventional systems.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1623117125463.jpeg\" alt=\"inphocal\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n\r\n			<p data-aid=\"47391\">inPhocal\'s laser system can maintain a focused spot at a distance 400 times longer than conventional systems, and can have a wider operating surface. / Photograph : inPhocal</p>\r\n			<div data-aid=\"47391\">\r\n				<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vecnKcLB6YU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n				<p>\"Our technology was based on a solid research.

We want to build this technology to cause a revolution in the field of laser-based products as no other technology is capable of going beyond the limits that are set by the current technology,\" said CTO of inPhocal Dr. Martijn Boerkamp, who is a physicist with 15 years of experience in optical technology and applications.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1623117125621.jpeg\" alt=\"inphocal\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n				<br>inPhocal\'s laser system. / Photograph: inPhocal\r\n\r\n				<p>\r\n					<br>Instead of selling the laser system, inPhocal comes up with a unique business model, which is Laser As A Service (LAAS). Customers have no need to invest a huge amount of money to buy the laser equipment, but they can rent the equipment with monthly fees. \"We know that companies that use inkjet in their production lines have monthly costs, related to the use of ink. Our LAAS model will allow companies to maintain their monthly costs the same as with inkjet, but they can switch to a cleaner, more sustainable technology in their production lines,\" said Martijn Boerkamp.</p>\r\n\r\n				<h2>Seeking partners in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n				<p>Now inPhocal\'s laser technology is expanding beyond marking on the bottles. Actually, with the high speed of laser beam and higher precision, inPhocal wants to target every industry that applies lasers, and this is also the reason why they join Garage+ Startup Global Program. Hearing of Taiwan\'s strong technology industry, inPhocal wants to bridge with big techs like TSMC, Logitech, and Foxconn, etc, through Garage+.</p>\r\n\r\n				<p>inPhocal already in talks with Logitech as part of the Garage+ to discuss collaboration for the use of the laser technology.\"We will continue to develop unique technology to revolutionize the complete market that uses lasers. Our next goal is to implement our technology into production lines and to start sales. We are already in talks with potential customers and supply chain partners.

Chip manufacturers like TSMC and UMC are currently expanding the production capacity, as they were asked to by governments around the world. inPhocal\'s laser technology might be able to help chip manufacturers to increase the capacity. \"Our laser beam can be focussed to a smaller spot than conventional lasers can, which means We have a more precise cutting technology, so our laser can let manufacturers put more chips on one wafer and cut it properly, which can increase the efficiency of production and help the chip shortage problem,\" said Martijn Boerkamp.</p>\r\n\r\n				<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n					<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47391\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47391</a></p>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</main>\r\n	</div></div>', NULL, 1, '2021-06-08 01:55:26', '2023-09-25 14:13:16', NULL),

As traditional POS terminals could only handle basic orderings, they developed the entire brand new POS system on their own, aiming to optimize the workflow between servers and chefs, which then became iCHEF, the most awarded POS design ever, including the 2016 iF Design Golden Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting to develop its overseas market in 2016, iCHEF has now owned the largest share of the POS system in Singapore, accounting for 30-40% of the market as it does domestically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, while the food and beverage(F&amp;B) sector, which has been hit hard by COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore, experienced a 26% decline in sales in 2020, iCHEF merchant sales however rose by 8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the success it has gained, iCHEF took another step forward recently as it integrated with the greatest unicorn in Southeast Asia. Grab, which has lately clinched a record-breaking SPAC merger, securing a $40 billion equity value, evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to offer various services such as GrabFood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, when receiving orders from GrabFood, restaurant staff had to key them into their iCHEF POS manually, which made taking orders from the food delivery platform a time-consuming and error-prone task. With the integration of the two platforms, GrabFood orders now appear on iCHEF menu automatically and thus are sent to the kitchens directly, saving up to 40 mins during peak hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1624260026738.jpeg\" alt=\"iChef.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The integration of iCHEF and GrabFood highly streamline the online food ordering and delivery process. / Photograph: iChef</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, there are over 30 e-payment methods in Singapore, and thus many restaurants have adopted Xero, a New-Zealand based online accounting platform for small businesses, to help with their bookkeeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the integration of financial data from the iCHEF into Xero, automated accounting is now available for restaurant owners on iCHEF. As Xero takes care of the accounting of the food cost, expenses, commissions, and the payment received from banks, orders from different channels with different payment methods are now automatically dealt with by iCHEF and Xero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1624260026927.jpeg\" alt=\"iCHEF.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>iCHEF users can now have their finances automatically managed, regardless of order channels and payment methods. / Photograph: iCHEF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iCHEF users can now have their finances automatically managed, regardless of order channels and payment methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, not only Grab and Xero, iCHEF has long been collaborating with Facebook, UberEats, and LINE in Taiwan. In March 2021, Google has also become one of its partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partnership deal with Google introduced Google My Business (GMB) service into iCHEF POS system. That is, instead of applying GMB on their own in the standard way, iCHEF now enables their users to directly open and have their shops licensed on Google Map, cutting the original 14 days of waiting to 3 days only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We aim to become the POS that integrates the most platforms, and the openness of Taiwan\'s ecosystem allows us to do so,\" said Ken Chen, the co-founder of iCHEF. Since there are no monopoly platforms in Taiwan, iCHEF is able to cooperate with as many companies as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, iCHEF is no longer just a POS system, it has now advanced its business by positioning itself as a platform of platforms for F&amp;B that benefits three sides of the restaurant business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For restaurant owners, it digitalizes the marketing and financial management; for restaurant staff, it makes orders and kitchen management more efficient. As for customers, iCHEF makes mobile ordering and membership management easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The menu, the table orderings, and the CRM data are all synchronized on iCHEF, it\'s an omni-channel service,\" he said. \"We\'ve always tried to make opening a restaurant a better business.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online ordering demand and food delivery service have both grown faster than ever in recent years, especially due to COVID-19. \"The pandemic has challenged the status-quo of the F&amp;B industry, and this causes larger F&amp;B companies to adopt iCHEF as their POS,\" he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, instead of developing new markets, the team is now focusing more on their technology development, gaining its footing in the countries it has developed and eyeing an IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47399\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47399</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-06-21 07:21:58', '2023-09-25 14:12:38', NULL);

Together, they founded MVP Fastlane, an accelerator equipping startups with resources in need, including capital, product development guidance, and global talent recruitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having worked in Silicon Valley, the trio considered an innovative mindset and a complete startup ecosystem two critical success factors for aspiring startups. \"Considering a stream of tech talents, it\'s strange how not one Taiwan-based software company could make it to NASDAQ,\" said Jack Wu. Having good connections with Taiwan talents and American startups, MVP Fastlane looks forward to bridging demand and supply, cultivating Taiwan as a powerful startup talent trove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1626660462717.jpeg\" alt=\"Silicon Valley\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silicon Valley is vibrant with new ideas. MVP Fastlane anticipates to cultivate the atmosphere in Taiwan. / Photograph : Joseph Sohm via shutterstock</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three founders of MVP Fastlane specialize in different functions of startup incubation. Tiwen Lin possesses a master\'s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA, with 8+ years of experience in product development. Jack Wu is a former Intel employee with over 30 successful startup projects and worldwide tech talent connections. Nick Wu is an investor in the Pasadena Angel Club, specializing in technical due diligence for startups in consumer hardware, semiconductor, and medical sectors. Abundant resources and exceptional expertise has made MVP oversubscribed in 2020. Currently, MVP Fastlane incubates 5 to 6 startups at a time, some US-based and some Taiwan-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>An incubator that focuses on collaboration in product development</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1626660461064.jpeg\" alt=\"MVP Fastlane Services\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three service facets of MVP Fastlane. / Photograph : MVP Fastlane</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MVP Fastlane offers the whole package of support for hand-picked startups, which serves as the most significant difference between MVP Fastlane and other incubators. MVP Fastlane gets first-hand insights on whether the product is marketable by working closely with the startup team. Participating with startups also helps them better picture their financial health, which serves as a determinant of whether to continue investing. Possessing insider information meant higher efficiency and credibility compared to other venture funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For start-ups in the MVP Fastlane ecosystem, they receive three facets of support: pre-seed investment, product design and development, and global talent recruitment. After due diligence is carried out, start-ups receive about 20 to 50 thousand USD investment from MVP Fastlane. The story does not end here. Start-ups receive follow-ups and further collaborate on product development with MVP Fastlane. Close collaboration fosters trust between investors and start-ups, also allowing for timely troubleshooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MVP Fastlane’s profit model involves R&amp;D fees, which are incurred when they guide product development and design. Start-ups they target are those with high potential and high growth in the sectors of enterprise AI software, the future of retails, and smart IoT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MVP Fastlane’s investment performs significantly better under a more precise and insight-based selection mechanism. Their investment acumen won recognition with world-class investors, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Plug N Play Ventures, Mucker Capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Success story: market success in under 4 months</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finli, one of MVP Fastlane’s clients, is a consumer finance start-up based in the US. With MVP’s product development guidance, Finli successfully delivered its product in 4 months and was later accepted into TechStar accelerator, acquiring USD 2.5 million in their seed round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product development process is no picnic. Jack said in our interview, \"When helping Finli design and deliver its product, we had to pivot 4 times. The team stuck with us, and from there, we see the difference between Taiwanese and American entrepreneurs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For start-ups, the ever-changing product development process could be a troublesome business. However, with product development experts and experienced marketers from MVP Fastlane, start-ups are equipped with all the resources they need to achieve market success. With support from MVP Fastlane, start-ups keep iterating and improving with real customer data, ensuring market feasibility and profitability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1626660460866.jpeg\" alt=\"MVP \" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partners and customers of MVP Fastlane / Photograph : MVP Fastlane</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bridging US start-ups with Taiwan talents</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One major problem for startups is finding the right talent. Headhunter companies often allocate capacity according to recruitment size; as a result, startups usually receive less attention. With MVP Fastlane\'s global talent pool dedicated to finding tech talents for startups, startups can access top-tier talents. MVP Fastlane has its all-star headhunter team and HR specialists, helping entrepreneurs build a top-tier team and manage all the HR complexity such as payrolls and benefits quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MVP Fastlane focuses on finding tech talents for companies, from junior software engineers to management positions. Currently, services are offered mainly for start-ups in the MVP Fastlane incubation ecosystem. As its headhunting business picks up pace, MVP Fastlane is anticipating expanding its capacity of talent recruitment, making a move into other US-based companies that wish to recruit Taiwan’s exceptional engineers. What’s more, as remote work becomes the trend for major companies in light of the pandemic, cross-border talent matching is met with increasing demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taiwan\'s talent is exceptional. We are the few headhunters that could bridge demand from US-based start-ups and the talent supply from Taiwan,\" said Jack. Managing cross-border resources, MVP Fastlane has 20 full-time employees and has expanded to Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Taipei, and Hsinchu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-07-19 02:20:03', '2023-09-25 14:11:59', NULL),

Through numerous explorations, even with a failed attempt to be a war zone photojournalist, she finally found her “tribe” when she arrived in Silicon Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have clear drives and goals bigger than themselves,\" said Elisa. That makes Silicon Valley a unique place for startup communities. Passion begets passion, and the sparks in people’s eyes lit up the fire in Elisa. “Perhaps startup is my destiny,” said Elisa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1629852959408.jpeg\" alt=\"Anchor Taiwan\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silicon Valley is a unique place for startup communities. Passion begets passion, and the sparks in people’s eyes lit up the fire in Elisa. / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, Elisa thought of leading Asian startups to the US. However, it’s a crowded space with many existing platforms and government programs already in place. She also quickly realized that startups from Asia still face a lot of systemic challenges that need further ecosystem cultivation to tackle. She wondered if there is a win-win scenario for international startups and talent to get what they need in Taiwan, while injecting fresh perspectives and tech professionals for Taiwan’s ecosystem. The belief is that cross-border collaboration can start from either side of the ocean, and the hope is that in the long term everyone is better off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Try to advocate Taiwan to the world from day one</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting corporates, governments and startups to go to Silicon Valley doesn’t take much persuasion, but it’s a very different story the other way around, especially when the destination is Taiwan, relatively unknown when it comes to the innovation ecosystem. \"Nobody was optimistic about Anchor Taiwan back then. When you are lucky, you meet people who at least know the difference between Taiwan and Thailand. But Taiwan is generally not on the map when it comes to a hub for investing or building your startups.\" said Elisa, \"I believe it is on us to find the right way to showcase Taiwan for the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<iframe width=\"540\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbpDlttN5CU?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_25=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Anchor Taiwan spent a lot of time over the years building databases, collecting industry insights, cultivating exclusive access, and honing its business acumen for real value-add that Taiwan has to offer. It hosted the first cohort in June 2017, and has come a long way as a well-recognized platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Main pillars of Anchor Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Cross-border, entrepreneurship and mission-driven are my personal life pillars,” said Elisa. “And that set the foundation of Anchor Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A believer for multidisciplinary and cross-industry collaborations, Anchor Taiwan’s programs last from a few days to one month before COVID. It also regularly curates events with topics ranging from the future of mobility, blockchain, 5G, corporate venturing, circular economy and more. Anchor Taiwan’s highly selected cohort members are often industry leaders, and they frequently share their expertise with the local community to “bring the world to Taiwan” through their residency or visits in town.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some signature event series</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meet the Anchor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Connecting people who are interested in startups - founders, investors, mentors and more. This event is limited to 30 attendees each time, with facilitated round circle introductions and free-flow networking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1629853015497.jpeg\" alt=\"Meet in Anchor\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet in Anchor / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Women in venture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The only community for female investors in Taiwan with roundtables for industry sharing, experience exchange and career development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1629853015445.jpeg\" alt=\"Anchor Taiwan 舉辦 Women in Venture女性區塊鏈社群活動\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gather the female investors in Taiwan and share investing information and news through a round table. / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Corporate Venturing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Building the ecosystem for corporate executives focusing on venture capital (CVC) and innovation for more cross-border and cross-industry collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Silicon Valley and Taiwan - different “terroir,” after all</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With years of observation, Elisa also noticed the special role the government plays in the Taiwanese startup ecosystem. For example, the Employment Gold Card program has attracted a lot of international talent to Taiwan, especially during COVID. While some programs work and some don’t, Elisa believes that the government has good intentions, and “Compared with what we had in 2017, the ecosystem is definitely a lot more international nowadays!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long run, too much “assistance” and subsidies from the governments may not be healthy. “Entrepreneurs are supposed to hustle with grit,” said Elisa. It would be an area worth monitoring for the best development of our ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47409\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47409</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-08-25 00:58:02', '2023-09-25 14:11:07', NULL),

Besides the nationals, new immigrants with valid ARCs and APRC holders can get “Quintuple stimulus vouchers”. About 140,000 new immigrants and 16,000 APRC holders are eligible for “Quintuple stimulus vouchers, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On May 19, 2021, Taiwan raised the national COVID alert to Level 3. Tightened epidemic prevention restrictions hit many domestic demand-oriented industries. A second round of amendments to the Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens were subsequently promulgated on May 31, which boosted the special budget cap for the COVID-19 response to NT$840 billion (US$30.3 billion). Taiwan\'s COVID-19 relief special budget was increased a third time in June by NT$259.5 billion (US$9.4 billion) to fund a \"relief package 4.0\" aimed at minimizing the impact on people and businesses. Now that the domestic transmission of the disease has been brought under stable control, the government has initiated a fourth increase to the special budget, adding NT$160 billion (US$5.8 billion) to fund \"quintuple stimulus vouchers,\" which will help encourage spending and boost domestic demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key measures of the relief package 4.0</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>■ Accelerating relief for individuals</strong>: In addition to administering aid in accordance with last year\'s standards, a subsidy is available for families with students enrolled in elementary school and below, as well as disabled students in junior and senior high school and the first three years of five-year junior colleges. Living allowances are also going out to children, young people, the elderly and the disabled in low to middle-low income households. Excluding those above a certain income, agricultural and fisheries workers, the self-employed, and workers without fixed employers also receive living allowances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also eligible for payments are workers without labor insurance, casual and part-time employees, full-time employees whose wages were impacted between May and July, workers aged 65 or older, and middle-aged to elderly workers who collect social insurance pension payments, small shopkeepers, self-employed and freelance art and culture workers, taxi and tour bus drivers, tour guides and tour group leaders, foreign permanent residents, short-term course instructors, and hourly workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Strengthening support for industry</strong>: Depending on circumstances, one-time operating subsidies and one-time employee payments are available to new target industries including commercial services, tourism, transportation, driving instruction, educational enterprises, the sports industry and affected personnel, arts and culture businesses, and care services. As for social welfare organizations, transportation businesses and bus companies that received money last year, additional assistance may be available this year as conditions dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, subsidies to help cover basic operating costs for airport commercial services and facilities companies have been raised to 40 percent. Passenger rental car businesses are eligible for new one-year subsidies to cover disease prevention materials for short-term rental cars, while subsidies for the tour industry covering the cancellation of tour group trips have been extended. A flexible approach to the classification of startup enterprises for relief purposes has also been adopted, among other measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Increasing the amount of bank loans available</strong>: COVID relief loans are administered through a number of programs, including worker relief loans, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) relief loans (including health care and educational business), state-owned bank relief loans, agricultural relief loans, and central bank SME relief loans. Under relief 4.0, the amount of loans available has been raised by another NT$800 billion (US$28.6 billion) for a total of NT$4.25 trillion (US$151.8 billion) since the first wave of loans began going out. Preferential interest rates for policy borrowing are also available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relief financing assistance for startups has been newly expanded, and individual and groups that borrow to establish cram schools, after-school care centers, and preschools are eligible for new interest rate subsidies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Reducing burdens</strong>: These measures aim to lighten the load for the general public. On the power front, summer electricity rates were suspended for residential customers in June, and only were applied to electricity usage after the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours of use in July. Summer rates were completely waived for disadvantaged care groups, vocational craft centers for the mentally handicapped, social welfare organizations, nursing centers and households equipped to care for physically handicapped family members. Service businesses and agricultural customers also received discounts based on reductions in revenue. Tenants in state-owned enterprise residential units and on non-public-use, state-owned land have been granted 20 percent rent reductions until June 2022. Finally, natural gas rates for passenger rental car businesses have been cut by half from July through September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quintuple stimulus vouchers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>■&nbsp;</strong>Each eligible individual can receive NT$5,000 (US$180) worth of vouchers in digital or paper form. To incentivize the use of the digital vouchers, more options are on offer for registering and pooling the voucher money to credit card accounts and using e-payment tools. Subsidies will also be available for small businesses to purchase electronic payment systems, and special QR codes will be designed for businesses to identify users of digital vouchers.

However, in recent years, he has felt that the overall development speed of Southeast Asia has made a big leap, which is faster than China’s economic growth. The current economic growth period of Southeast Asia is just in time for the take-off of digital e-commerce, and Vietnam has a smart phone. The most important opportunity for the rapid development of e-commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Kronos Wu established VeSA, an e-commerce accelerator in Vietnam, and use Vietnam as the first overseas base. VeSA not only provides high-standard hardware equipment, but also hopes to help more Taiwanese products expand into the Vietnamese market.

The platform recommends the most practical and high-quality dental materials from Taiwan dentists, Online courses, physical courses and equipment information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dental clinic management system will be developed in 2018. In addition to providing registration and electronic medical records systems, it will integrate ERP, CRM and other management systems. In addition, an AI engine is introduced into the medical record system to perform deep learning such as auxiliary diagnosis and disease risk prediction on dental radiological images. AI artificial intelligence must be used to redefine the dental industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vietnam branch was established in August 2019, and the international cloud version of the medical record management system was published in November.

(409, 'Taiwan-licensed US attorney leverages Taiwan engineering talents to consolidate law tech startup Proxifile and secure your right as a creditor', '2021-10-06', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Serial entrepreneur and prominent US attorney Neil Peretz observed that lots of people in the US were bothered by the complexity of creditor claims in bankruptcy and property. He teamed up with former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, to establish the law tech startup Proxifile to use AI to accelerate and simplify the claiming process.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Bankruptcy claims are some of the most common types of cases to appear in civil court in the US. Because the US is a state of law and has a mature legal system, it can be very complicated for people to recover money and property they are owed due to countless documents to be filed, obscure laws to study and strategize about, and lots of procedures to be followed which have scant tolerance for error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In society nowadays, more and more products, real estate, and other kinds of financial tools have been created based on contracts, which means that everyone has the possibility to end up as a creditor one day when the other side of the contract does not fulfill its obligations. No longer is it just large businesses that are creditors who are owed money, property, or performance. Now individuals and small businesses are equally likely to end up as a creditor. However filing a lawsuit to try to recover money is always a painful, complicated, and expensive process for average citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1633490286599.jpeg\" alt=\"PROXIFILE\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filing a lawsuit to get back the money is always a painful process for average citizens. / Photograph : PROXIFILE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in the 2008 financial crisis, there were lots of people who lost their money when financial institutions and markets collapsed. Although many individuals pursued matters in court through a lawsuit, many could not afford lawyers to pursue claims through the court, particularly when big bankrupt debtors hired sophisticated legal counsel to complicate matters. “Large debtors will claim bankruptcy when they still owe many many small creditors, not only individuals but also small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs), and the creditors not only have to fill out a complicated claims form correctly, but they also need to identify and provide the right supporting evidence and determine the most advantageous legal way to present their claim. If they do not complete the forms, provide the right evidence, and select the best legal positioning and file it correctly then they may have no claim at all,” said Neil Peretz, co-founder of Proxifile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides filling out the complicated claim forms in time, with bankruptcy claims, even small mistakes can put the claim in jeopardy, like providing insufficient supporting evidence, mischaracterization of the claim, and failure to exhaust remedies, etc. Hiring a specialist bankruptcy lawyer to take care of every procedure should relieve the burden, but the consulting fee might be as high as USD$500~800 per hour, and average citizens can’t afford this price -especially when it’s unknown how many hours the lawyer will require to do the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1633490286964.jpeg\" alt=\"Proxifile\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neil Peretz observed that lots of people in the US were bothered by the complexity of creditor claims in bankruptcy and property. He teamed up with former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, to establish the law tech startup Proxifile to use AI to accelerate and simplify the claiming process. / Photograph : Neil Peretz</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Claims as the Service: Claims Automation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Neil Peretz, as a serial entrepreneur and founder of several tech companies including Contract Wrangler and PocketMail, decided to leverage the technology to help people efficiently file the claims. He teamed up with his friend and former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, as well as recruited experienced software engineering leader, Manchi Leung, to help build the engineering team. Combining their expertise from law, finance, and engineering, they quickly rolled out the AI engine which can guide creditors to identify and provide the right information and documents, and then the AI software makes assessments about the best filing strategies and claims positioning. Furthermore, the AI engine tracks the filing process to make sure creditors are alerted to case developments and progress in their claim process. By using its own software and dashboards, the company aspires to provide clients with the same level of detail and intelligence as traditional business software systems, which is not a typical strength for lawyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Neil possesses rich experience in law; he has been a financial services regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as a Trial Attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice and General Counsel at multiple financial services companies. When he and I decided to co-found Proxifile, I was truly fascinated by the company’s mission to help individuals and small businesses and couldn’t say no,” said Cassindy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1633490286694.jpeg\" alt=\"PROXIFILE2\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proxifile will guide you on how to prepare your lawsuit. / Photograph : PROXIFILE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When creditors are using Proxifile’s engine, first they fill the simple intake form and upload supporting documents, review, and sign to quick start the claim. After initial analysis by the AI engine, Proxifile also has an expert team of specialist attorneys to review the claims to improve the size or speed up the recovery. Making sure everything is perfect, Proxifile then assembles and files an official Proof of Claim and supporting legal memoranda and documentation with the relevant court, and the users can see new filings and read updates from the dashboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neil believes that high lawyer consulting fees shouldn’t be the barrier for people to claim the property, so instead of charging by hours with high fees, Proxifile’s upfront charges for every bankruptcy claim is USD$ 250, which makes filing the lawsuit affordable for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Leverage Taiwan’s engineering talents</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Proxifile closed the Pre-seed round with USD$ 2.3M this March and the investors include the Founder of Linkedin, the former CEO of American Express, and Taiwanese VC firm Darwin Ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bankruptcy Claims service has been launched and is already helping people get back their money. Recently, they also began beta testing their forthcoming Property Claims Solution to solve the dispute and ensure full compliance and transparency of landlords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our AI engine and claims service are not just for Americans, there are lots of people and businesses from other countries who are involved in business in the United States and become creditors and claimants there. They can also leverage our AI engine,” said Neil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Taiwan employment gold card holder, Neil has lived in Taiwan for a time and knows there are so many talented engineers there. Proxifile’s Vice President of Engineering, Manchi Leung, is building the research and software development center in Taiwan. “Taiwan is an important research center for Proxifile, and we plan to hire many employees here,” said Manchi. Given the engineering talents from Taiwan, Neil and Proxifile can continuously add more functions to the product and offer people more affordable and transparent access to their legal rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47482\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47482</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-10-06 03:28:24', '2023-09-25 14:09:29', NULL),

Co-founders Hsuan Lee and Edwin Yen come with abundant hands-on experience in the blockchain industry, both boasting abundant experiences in the crypto space. The two worked previously at blockchain start-up Cobinhood, creating a blockchain with 10,000 transactions per second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) craze swept across the world. An NFT is a digital collectible stored on blockchain, which ensures assets are hacker-proof and provides public proof of ownership over a piece of digital asset, like an artwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed as a fringe hobby of tech-savvy consumers previously, these kinds of digital assets quickly gained popularity and signals great market potential. Artist Beeple sold an image collage on blockchain worth USD$ 69 million at a Christie’s auction sale in March. NFT demonstrates a fast-moving development, growing nearly tenfold from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the transaction volume of the NFT market came to USD$ 338.04 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While NFT took the world by storm, most people still haven’t got a clue when it comes to purchasing digital collectibles. Blockchain applications are still Greek to many. The good news is, start-ups like portto are working their way to make blockchain applications easy and accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1636958245528.jpeg\" alt=\"nft\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) craze swept across the world. / Photograph : nft via fiverr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Perking up tedious NFT transaction process</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During a networking event hosted by Blocto and supported by AppWorks, Blocto first came in touch with Mikhael Naayem, Chief Business Officer of Dapper Labs. Dapper Labs built the Flow blockchain, a more efficient infrastructure for consumers compared with Ethereum. “We partnered with Dapper Labs as both teams look in the same direction. That is, we are looking forward to building a blockchain application ecosystem,” said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1636958245611.jpeg\" alt=\"NBA Top Shot\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the Flow blockchain, portto offered services on sports platform NBA Top Shot, which sells digital collectibles that allows basketball fans to buy and collect NBA highlights. &nbsp;Photograph : NBA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the FLOW blockchain, portto offered services on sports platform NBA Top Shot, which sells digital collectibles that allows basketball fans to buy and collect NBA highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foraying into the NFT trading market is a strategic move for portto. “It’s difficult for blockchain wallets like Blocto to bring in users who aren’t familiar with the blockchain technology. However, as NFT gains attention among the general public, we are seeing an opportunity to leverage our user-friendly interface and bring in blockchain laymen to our ecosystem,” said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto. NBA TopShot is a case in point, bringing basketball lovers to the blockchain realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from NBA TopShot, a wide array of digital collectibles could be purchased on Blocto. Users could purchase Vault by CNN, which are historical news moments, with the app. Such as the piece in which CNN projects Trump’s win of the presidential election, is valued at 20 USD. MotoGP Ignition, which features NFTs that represent motorbikes and personalities in the real world premier motorcycle racing world championship, could also be purchased with the Blocto wallet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Blocto memorizes your private key for you</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Blockchain wallets are a gateway to interact with blockchain-based applications (also called dApps). Most blockchain wallets on the market require users to be familiar with blockchain. For example, a “private key” is generated once a blockchain account is open, then users need to memorize the private key securely themselves. Or else, there is no way to recover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1636958303944.jpeg\" alt=\"截圖 2021-08-22 11.55.34.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph: Blocto</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blocto makes accessing blockchain as simple as signing up for Facebook and Gmail. Simply type in your email address, and then a blockchain wallet is ready to use. “With regard to account creation, we take a hybrid approach, coupling decentralized and centralized systems together,” said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users can decide whether their Blocto accounts are decentralized or centralized, meaning whether their accounts are managed and safeguarded by people other than themselves. “Only 10% of our users switch their accounts to fully decentralized ones, “ said Hsuan Lee. Although the scenario contradicts the biggest selling point of blockchain technology, it nevertheless proves that users value convenience more than decentralization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Game changer: breaking the barrier between different chains</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“Portto anticipates to erase obstacles of cross-chain trading,” said Edwin Yen, co-founder and COO of portto. Portto rolled out the Blocto points system to fulfill that cause. Blocto points serve as an intermediary that could be used to pay the fees across different chains. Portto envisions a future in which boundaries between different blockchains are non-existent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With most wallets on the market, users need to understand which chain each dApp runs on, which could be painful for users as information is scattered. For example, CryptoKitties runs on Flow. That means users must access its service with one particular cryptocurrency, the FLOW. It could cause trouble for users who possess only Ethereum or Bitcoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, with Blocto, users could access dApps built on various chains such as Ethereum, Flow and Solana, and all transactions could be paid via Blocto points, saving the trouble of finding out which cryptocurrency should be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>User experience is at the core of portto’s product development. People often shy away from dApps, as they are difficult to understand due to the intricate blockchain technology. “Intuitive design allows users to access dApp service without having to understand the blockchain technology,” said Hsuan Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Token sale: prelude to the Blocto ecosystem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2021, portto completed 8 million USD private token sale. Investors include prominent individuals and accelerators, including 500 Startups, AppWorks, Animoca Brands, Alameda Research, EVG Capital, June Fund, Dapper Labs CEO and Rally CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1636958391888.jpeg\" alt=\"Portto-7\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team has an average of 5+ experience in the burgeoning blockchain industry. With a highly passionate group of seasoned marketers, engineers and designers, Blocto is poised for success. / Photograph : Portto</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portto’s funding comes in the form of token sales, where investors of portto receive virtual “Blocto Tokens (BLT)” instead of shares. BLT tokens are a way to liven up the Blocto ecosystem, as 90% of BLT holders are incumbent users and app providers of Blocto. Restricting token sale to strategic investors is healthy for expanding the ecosystem, as their profit is tied with the ecosystem’s long-term development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLT holders can make critical decisions in the ecosystem such as deciding which chains to integrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“BLT token serves as an excellent reward system that aligns the interests of users and dApp developers. Users get rewarded for storing their assets in Blocto and using dApps frequently. On the other hand, dApps get rewarded for bringing users into the ecosystem,” said Edwin Yen. Portto is on the optimistic lookout of building a dApp ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47456\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47456</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2021-11-15 06:40:51', '2023-09-25 14:08:36', NULL),

But in fact, the related industries of metaverse issues have already quietly entered our lives. From the popularization of 5G technology, big data analysis, artificial intelligence applications, XR, blockchain, IP content, health care, intelligent life and many other industries, all of them cannot be separated from the framework of metaverse.

The latest SurrealM is a remote learning platform developed by metaverse in the education field.Through teachers and students playing the role of creating their own digital twin, teaching and group discussions can go on in the virtual world, breaking the traditional school walls, and using AI learning feedback. In the future, coupled with the application of blockchain decentralization and other technologies, meta-school will gradually emerge and enter the truly decentralized virtual education world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Hsin-Chien Huang, a new media artist, shared how the combination of metaverse and art, led the audience to a feast of metaverse art across space and imagination. Metaverse is not only has great advantages in entertainment and social interaction, including professional work, creation, belief and others, but also the social and cultural will be developed faster, and it will also have a positive impact on national development. Professor Hsin-Chien Huang said that we are now gradually entering a world of digital twin and integration of virtual and reality under the concept of digital twin. As Taiwan enters the metaverse, we should first think about what our life style is? What is the value of Taiwan compared to other countries\' cultural industries? This is a question worthy of our deep consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as \"VR Godmother\" is also the general manager of Digi Space Co., Ltd., Cori Shieh is an important promoter of Taiwan\'s XR industry. She said that the Z generation (born from 1995 to 2009), also known as the digital natives, is no stranger to the current digital technology. From the recent hot news, there are examples of young people earning 5 million Taiwan dollars through paintings, many young people in Korea are keen on buying land in the virtual world, and young people in Southeast Asia are earning money by playing games (Play to earn) in NFT. Earn money by creating and selling, buying land, and playing games. What’s interesting is that you don’t have to have a VR device to enter the metaverse.

We trained for marathons together and after running for a while that’s when we started to talk about starting something together.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The duo first formed an idea about combining the power of AI and IoT at the end of 2015 and went on to launch thingnario in 2017. Speaking about why he took the plunge into this business venture, Professor Hsu says it’s because he has known Cardy for a long time and he trusts him. “There’s already a lot of business trust between us and he is a professional in everything he does.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name thingnario comes from the combination of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘scenario’, meaning its AIoT solutions can be used in many different scenarios and applications. Its mission is \'to mitigate the IT technology gap in the physical industry with software innovations\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked why he chose to focus on the renewable energy sector, he said initially they didn’t know which industry to focus on — it was a process of trial and error. “We tried applying our solutions in many different industries such as healthcare, finance &amp; banking and even plastic manufacturing. But we quickly learned those weren’t suitable areas for us to apply our solutions as it was hard to be scalable in those sectors. So we turned to renewable energy as we predicted that it was soon going to experience rapid growth and there will be a demand for scalable AI solutions to optimize energy efficiency. And we wanted our startup to capitalize on the potential growth and development of this sector.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, there is now a burgeoning market demand for renewable energy as countries around the world are pushing for an energy transition into a low-carbon future. In the span of 5 years, thingnario now manages over 2,000 solar farms around the world with a total capacity of more than 1GW. It is also growing rapidly in many different international markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Mexico. <strong>With over 800 clients worldwide, thingnario has an impressive client retention rate of 99.6%.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640069280295.jpeg\" alt=\"慧景jpeg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s a flexible plug-and-play system that can be deployed anywhere and withstand extreme temperatures at remote solar farms,” says Professor Hsu. / Photograph: thingnario</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Boosting solar energy efficiency with AI-driven data analytics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>thingnario combines Taiwan’s expertise in hardware manufacturing to make deployment of its software solutions very easy for customers. “It’s a flexible plug-and-play system that can be deployed anywhere and withstand extreme temperatures at remote solar farms,” says Professor Hsu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its scalable solutions use AI/ML and computer vision technology to analyze huge amounts of data to establish and predict solar production models and patterns. This provides businesses with real time insights and actionable data via instant mobile notifications that help enable faster and better decision making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>thingnario’s advanced AI technology also has the capability to differentiate many types of faults in real time. For example, when a tree is blocking a solar panel, the system will understand this issue and alert the client so they can take action immediately to prevent service disruptions. Customers who use thingnario have reported a boost in energy production profit by 12-20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640069279566.jpeg\" alt=\"慧景科技\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>thingnario combines Taiwan’s expertise in hardware manufacturing to make deployment of its software solutions very easy for customers. / Photograph: 陳映璇攝</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Efficiency, reliability and scalability is what we offer for businesses,” says Professor Hsu. “As a company that manages critical energy data and analytics, accountability is very important, so it is a top priority for us to ensure our services are reliable and cyber-secure.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From 1-10: thingnario is on track to accelerate its international market growth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>thingnario was recently named as one of the winners at this year’s prestigious Business Startup Awards, held annually by The Ministry of Economic Affairs Small and Medium Enterprise Administration to recognise and celebrate the best startups in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The award-winning startup is now at a growth stage from 1-10 and they have made new hires such as a new Chief Operating Officer, William Kao, to help accelerate the company’s growth and expansion into new markets. The Southeast Asia market will be a key focus for them in 2022. They are also making strategic plans on entering the Japanese market, in which the government recently announced its plans to raise the renewable energy target to 36-38% by 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking about the future of thingnario, Professor Hsu hopes this is just the beginning of more software startups he will see in Taiwan. “I hope Taiwan can have its own Paypal Mafia. Not only do I want thingnario to be a success, I also hope we can inspire our own thingnario employees to go on and launch their own spin-offs, so that together we can expand Taiwan’s tech ecosystem, and ultimately bolster Taiwan’s global position as a software leader.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640069298157.jpeg\" alt=\"徐宏民_台大資工所教授_2021_12_06_蔡仁譯攝-3 (1)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I hope Taiwan can have its own Paypal Mafia,\" says Professor Hsu. / Photograph : 蔡仁譯攝</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47565\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47565</a></p>\r\n<div data-v-6c8aee9a=\"\">\r\n	<div data-v-6c8aee9a=\"\">\r\n		<div data-v-6c8aee9a=\"\">\r\n			<a data-v-6c8aee9a=\"\" href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/190877729427?fbclid=IwAR177Ipe54ZabBaXP70cH9eXl5nY4SMHl_b5UPJH-7PSoqbgg1Gnsn6LeJ4\"></a></div></div></div>', NULL, 1, '2021-12-21 06:56:20', '2023-09-25 14:06:36', NULL),

Having endured nearly two years of the pandemic, employees everywhere are tired, so it’s not surprising to see the great attrition catching on in Asia, where opportunities in the tech sector are booming like never before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The demand for technology-based solutions is at an all-time high as consumers and businesses alike are turning to tech for answers to their pandemic-riddled woes. For technology firms in the region, hiring is one of their biggest challenges right now. As we return to normal routines, companies aren’t just competing for consumers. Employees are also essential for a company to thrive.&nbsp;<strong>There’s plenty of research showing that money and fancy perks are not deciding factors anymore — employees want more freedom, recognition and a renewed sense of purpose at work.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Here are four essential methods to attract and retain qualified talents in the new era:</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Entrusting your employees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One essential factor to attract and retain qualified employees is to allow them the space they need to grow, and entrusting them with the autonomy to carry out their tasks. Especially the young workforce from generation Z values very much independence and free exploration in their work environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Flexible or remote working is a plus</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandemic has altered our working behaviors with working hours and destinations becoming flexible. As the pandemic continues to thwart physical gatherings around the world, companies need to establish well-rounded policies and employee communication mechanisms for Work From Home. One company-wide survey from iKala revealed that more than half of our staff believe that working from home is more productive than working at the office, and 52% prefer to continue remote work even after the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already, around two-thirds of our employees continue to work remotely every day, and we are committed to encouraging better work and life integration for our employees — enabling them to work from anywhere that yields the same results as the office would.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Investing in training &amp; development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology is evolving at a staggering pace, and many roles now require people to be equipped with new skills and competencies in order to keep up with the changes and continue growing as an organisation. In addition to offering learning opportunities for employees, it’s equally important to build a workforce that can self-learn new ways of working to remain efficient and competitive. For example, since the pandemic, here at iKala, we have introduced a new series of learning resources to help our employees improve their managing skills and tech knowledge. We also introduced recommended reading lists for employees to learn by themselves and expand their areas of interest. How to help employees increase their adaptability and maintain a growth mindset is essential for any company.</p>%0', NULL, 0, '2021-12-21 07:00:03', '2021-12-28 03:38:55', NULL),

We are committed to backing the next generation of entrepreneurs in Greater Southeast Asia (ASEAN+Taiwan) and helping them to facilitate the region’s transition into the digital age. Building off the firm’s decade-plus of experience, AppWorks works closely with early-stage founders to achieve product-market fit, while helping growth-stage companies establish sustainable business models at scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting in 2018, blockchain was incorporated in the firm’s core mandate. We believe that the technology is currently driving a massive paradigm shift, opening up new disruptive and innovative opportunities for the next generation of entrepreneurs as the world transitions into the web3 era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, blockchain entered a mass adoption phase. With the emergence of new innovative applications such as DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and web3 infrastructure, an unprecedented number of new funds, retail investors, and users have flocked to the crypto world, creating a flywheel effect that has facilitated the formation of key web3 infrastructure that we believe will usher in a new era of large-scale commercialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As the world decentralizes, will development vary between different countries and regions?” This is a question that we’ve mulled over years. With the accelerated development of blockchain, we recognize that, in fact, regional dynamics have become more pronounced. We found that in Greater Southeast Asia’s major markets, the confluence of different historical, economic, industrial, societal, and cultural contexts has resulted in crypto adoption taking different forms. The emergence of diversified crypto markets is driving growth in the region to meet different market conditions and leading to new business models and approaches in the industry that can be applied globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following is an overview of our analysis and views on each major market in the region:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Indonesia: Crypto Investment Outstripping Public Equities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682798015.jpeg\" alt=\"Indonesia- Crypto Investment Outstripping Public E\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indonesia, the world’s fourth largest population and the largest in GSEA, is estimated to have an <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2021/04/15/grassroot-strategy-to-realize-financial-inclusion-in-indonesia.html\">unbanked population of 66%.</a> Based on market size alone, Indonesia has become an important market for the development of blockchain. Indonesia is entering a financial paradigm shift driven by blockchain and cryptoassets, and overall development is trending towards exponential growth. According to <a href=\"https://vnexplorer.net/over-6-5-million-indonesians-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-first-5-months-of-2021-ministry-of-trade-says-a2021214858.html\">statistics</a> from Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade, during the first five months of 2021, more than 6.5 million people in Indonesia traded cryptocurrencies—far exceeding the 2.2 million who traded public equities—totaling US$25 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, compared to US$4.4 billion over the same period in 2020, representing year-on-year growth of 470%. With statistics like these, it comes as no surprise that cryptocurrency has become the most popular investment category among Indonesian retail traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with other countries, the Indonesian government is relatively positive towards crypto. Since September 2018, a <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cryptocurrency-in-indonesia\">series of laws</a> have been enacted, signaling the open attitude of the Indonesian government. The Commodity Futures Exchange Supervisory Board (BAPPEBTI) oversees cryptocurrency-related issues and has provided legal frameworks for licensing and trading. Currently, Indonesians can legally own and trade a total 229 different cryptocurrencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indonesia’s crypto landscape is underlined by the rapid development and adoption of exchanges, wallets, asset management tools, and other DeFi applications. For example, Indodax, established in 2014, is Indonesia’s leading exchange with more than 4.7 million users. With increasing acceptance of investment in cryptocurrencies by the general public, new areas of development, such as investment platform <a href=\"https://usenobi.com/\">NOBI</a>, that provide asset management services that cater to crypto users will mark the next wave of growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Philippines: Massive User-Driven Growth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682832018.jpeg\" alt=\"Philippines: Massive User-Driven Growth.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>圖片來源 : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https://yieldguild.io/\">Yield Guild Games</a> (YGG) broke out in the Philippines and became a global phenomenon. Evolving from its initial function of assisting Axie Infinity in recruiting and training players, YGG is now home to more than 1,500 NFT game guilds based in the Philippines. YGG provides players with digital asset management, game scholarships, and community support—becoming the world’s largest NFT gaming guild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://playercounter.com/axie-infinity/\">Playercounter</a>, more than 40% of Axie Infinity players hail from the Philippines alone. Play-to-earn has proven to provide meaningful income to users, effectively alleviating economic pressure caused by the pandemic for many users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This model of massive user acquisition to drive ecosystem growth is a unique characteristic of blockchain development in the Philippines. We anticipate that with the mass inflow of capital and users, there will be a corresponding entrepreneurial response that will lead to the creation of new and innovative applications in the Philippines. We have seen this trend emerge with projects like NFT marketplace <a href=\"https://vention.app/home/\">Vention</a> and gaming guild management and data platform <a href=\"https://www.blockchainspace.asia/\">BlockchainSpace.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Singapore: Leveraging the Strength of Asia’s Financial Center</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682831827.jpeg\" alt=\"03.-Singapore.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore has always been known as Asia’s financial center, building off the government’s proactive policies over the past several decades. A similar trajectory is also taking shape in the country’s blockchain development. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is the leading regulatory body overseeing cryptoassets, and has long demonstrated a relatively open and friendly stance on the development of blockchain and cryptoassets within the city-state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 2017, MAS issued “<a href=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/~/media/MAS/Regulations%20and%20Financial%20Stability/Regulations%20Guidance%20and%20Licensing/Securities%20Futures%20and%20Fund%20Management/Regulations%20Guidance%20and%20Licensing/Guidelines/A%20Guide%20to%20Digital%20Token%20Offerings%20%2014%20Nov%202017.pdf\">A Guide to Digital Token Offering</a>” which established the Singapore government’s policy framework for ICOs, issuers and related platforms, under the purview of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). In January 2021, the “<a href=\"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/payment-services-amendment-bill\">Payment Service Act</a>” (PSA) was launched, regulating all cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and digital payment services in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, there has been an emergence of several new blockchain-related applications. For example, <a href=\"https://www.biconomy.io/\">Biconomy</a>, which builds transaction infrastructure for blockchain applications and optimizes cross-chain transaction experience; <a href=\"https://www.xfers.com/sg?\">Xfers</a>, a developer of financial electronic payments; and <a href=\"https://www.vauld.com/\">Vauld</a>, a service provider covering cryptocurrency transactions, lending, and wallets. In the future, we expect more projects coming out of Singapore in cryptocurrency-related asset securitization, license compliance, and international exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thailand: From Late Mover to Frontrunner</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682869654.jpeg\" alt=\"05.-Thailand.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Thailand’s blockchain ecosystem can be considered quite early, 2021 marked an acceleration point with several milestones. In November, Thailand’s first blockchain unicorn was born as crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.bitkub.com/\">Bitkub</a> sold a <a href=\"https://www.thaiexaminer.com/thai-news-foreigners/2021/11/06/bitkub-thailand-first-unicorn-success/\">51% stake</a> worth US$535 million to Siam Commercial Bank. Paired together with logistics provider <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2124699/flash-group-becomes-first-thai-unicorn\">Flash Express’s</a> newly minted billion-dollar valuation, Thailand welcomed its first unicorns of the internet and Web3 era respectively within a five-month period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitkub’s success is galvanizing the Thai blockchain ecosystem, demonstrating that Thailand can develop scalable blockchain infrastructure. Bitkub alumni and seasoned Web2 entrepreneurs are diving into Thailand’s blockchain space, just as we’ve witnessed in other markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, we can already see the emergence of more mature and advanced Web3 applications. For example, the emergence of cross-chain data oracle platform Band Protocol and metaverse gaming guild GuildFi show the level of innovation and reiteration happening in the market. We believe that in the near future, we will see more projects in the NFT space, building off Bangkok’s rich fashion and design industry and the country’s active NFT artist community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vietnam: The Axie Infinity Effect</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682870070.jpeg\" alt=\"06.-Vietnam.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to Vietnam, the most well-known player is <a href=\"https://skymavis.com/\">Sky Mavis</a>, the developer behind the killer NFT-based game Axie Infinity. According to <a href=\"https://cryptoslam.io/axie-infinity/sales/summary\">CryptoSlam statistics</a>, since its launch in 2018, the total amount of NFT transactions on Axie Infinity reached more than US$3.7 billion, with more than <a href=\"https://thenewscrypto.com/axie-infinitys-daily-active-users-increased-by-almost-5000-in-six-months/\">two million daily active users</a>, culminating in Sky Mavis’s recently completed US$152 million Series B round of financing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of Sky Mavis’s success on Vietnam can be observed from two perspectives. First, it is driving the growth of Vietnam’s local NFT gaming ecosystem and attracting international capital to accelerate development and adoption. For example, in October, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/26/sipher-raises-6-8m-for-pc-based-blockchain-game-world-of-sipheria/\">Sipher raised US$6.8 million</a> in seed financing from major global investors. In addition, there’s been a surge in casual and semi-casual GameFi projects coming out of the woodwork including <a href=\"https://mydefipet.com/\">My DeFi Pet</a>, <a href=\"https://mytheria.io/\">Mytheria</a>, <a href=\"https://thetanarena.com/\">Thetan Arena</a>, and <a href=\"https://faraland.io/\">Faraland.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, Vietnamese users have demonstrated high levels of acceptance for blockchain and cryptoassets. According to the <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/\">2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> survey conducted by Chainalysis, Vietnam ranked first globally in terms of overall adoption. Among three indicators, on-chain value received, on-chain retail value received, and P2P exchange trade volume, Vietnam ranked in the top five in the world. We anticipate that new applications in DeFi, wallets, and asset management like we see with <a href=\"https://kyber.network/\">Kyber Network’s</a> Liquidity Hub will highlight the next wave of blockchain innovation in Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taiwan: A Huge Digital Market Driven by Engineering Talent</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1640682915611.jpeg\" alt=\"04.-Taiwan.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with other markets in the GSEA region, Taiwan has two notable characteristics and advantages in blockchain development. First, Taiwan is home to a massive digital gaming and entertainment market. To illustrate this market size, according to <a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/go/state-of-mobile-2021/\">App Annie</a>, in 2020, Taiwanese consumers spent US$2.44 billion in the App Store, equal to total spending from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia combined. Second, Taiwan has accumulated a wealth of engineering talent across manufacturing, software, and hardware integration. This talent pool has formed the core of Taiwan’s blockchain industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, Taiwan also joined the global NFT wave with early-stage activity. Leveraging the island’s fertile digital gaming and entertainment market, Taiwanese founders are adopting NFTs to create products, services, and new business models. Musicians, artists, game publishers, and influencers have embraced NFTs to build public awareness and tap into this new digital format of ownership, demonstrating immense promise for large-scale commercial adoption of NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the advent of Ethereum, Taiwan’s local engineers have continued to explore the frontiers of blockchain development, becoming a key driving force in the crypto world. Taiwan is home to several notable projects led by seasoned teams, including Perpetual Protocol, which provides Virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM) to implement perpetual contract solutions; smart contract wallet <a href=\"https://blocto.portto.io/en/\">Blocto</a> has become the go-to wallet for Flow—with more than <a href=\"https://flowscan.org/staking/overview\">80% of Flow users</a> trusting Blocto for Flow Token pledges. In cross-chain applications, Blocto also supports Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Avalanche (c-chain), and Polygon, among other mainstream public chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bright Days Ahead</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few years ago, you’d be hard pressed to find the words web3, blockchain, DeFi, or NFTs uttered anywhere outside of niche crypto spheres in this part of the world. Now, sentiment from founders and investors across the region have evidently shifted from “why web3?” to “how do I get a piece of it?”—largely in this past year alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is at the forefront from a technical perspective, with an unparalleled engineering pool in terms of cost and performance; Indonesia is emerging as massive market for web3 consumers, now with crypto traders outnumbering stock traders by severalfold; Philippines is in a close second, with everyday users showing an uncanny demand for GameFi to make ends meet; Thailand’s historically nascent ecosystem is expected to garner significantly more attention now with their first crypto unicorn; Vietnam, given Axie’s success, is quickly distinguishing itself as a the world’s NFT gaming hub; and lastly, Singapore’s position as the region’s financial and management hub will likely extend into the web3 era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any doubts of whether or not web3 is here to stay were certainly eroded by the massive strides that the regional ecosystem has taken in 2021. Looking forward, the development and adoption of web3 is looking especially bright. Although crypto markets will likely ebb and flow in the coming months and years, with the occasional bears and dips, many stakeholders across the value chain have already gotten taste, and will likely only want more.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>The 2021 Greater Southeast Asia Blockchain Ecosystem Map is authored by AppWorks.

But as the company pivoted to a software-only business, Toby saw the potential in Chinese-speaking markets, especially Taiwan, because of its strong market for learning English, and how Taiwanese parents place a great deal of importance on their children’s education.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A \'magic window\' for children to learn English</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<iframe width=\"540\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEiCLrbUNG4?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiration can strike anywhere and for Toby, it came about during his year abroad from Oxford University. During his studies, he spent a year teaching English to primary school children between 6-7 years old in Russia and Italy. It was during this time he saw that children who begin learning English in big groups, experience difficulty learning the words, accent, and structures of the English language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He began researching ways on how to help children build a strong foundation in English before they even enter the classroom for the first time. His research back at Oxford showed that in early childhood, there is a \'magic window\', between ages 2-6, when children can more easily learn foreign languages, and their accents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a passion for teaching, Toby saw an opportunity where he could make a difference while doing something he loves. He founded Lingumi with the goal of making English learning fun and effective for preschool children, and importantly, it also has to be affordable and accessible for all. “What I care most about in the world, is I think that there\'s a very uneven or unequal access to the skills that really matter for a child,” said Toby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making digital teaching experiences feel more human with AI</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lingumi uses an asynchronous teaching model and offers daily English lessons, interactive learning games, speech recognition games and video-based tasks to help with a child’s English learning. It leverages AI voice recognition technology to help children learn to say new words and phrases while improving their accents and pronunciations. AI also plays an important role in helping smooth the conversational flow that the child has with the teacher during lessons. Toby said this is an area of AI application they are investing a lot of effort in because the most important way they use AI is to make the speaking experience feel as human as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interactive teaching experience needs to feel human because Toby believes that the thing that is most central to education is the teacher and student relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking from his own experience of meeting his English teacher when he was 8 years old, Toby said the teacher changed his life. “I think for a child, if you give them one incredible teacher, it can really change their life, both emotionally and in terms of the skills they acquire through that teacher, that gives them the confidence to want to learn, but also gives them the actual skills they need. I don’t think a TV show, a YouTube video or a cartoon can do that in the same way. What we try to do that\'s different in the digital space, is to bring the magic of human teaching to your child.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-12/img-1639475412-12797.jpg\" alt=\"1124_lingumi-223\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I think for a child, if you give them one incredible teacher, it can really change their life,\" said Toby. / Photograph: Lingumi</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Localizing content to meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is currently one of Lingumi’s biggest markets, so when it comes to content creation, the company is focused on making specific content that is relevant and useful for families in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Toby shared that the way preschoolers learn English is basically the same around the world but as children get older, they start to think more in their first language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-12/img-1639475626-75847.jpg\" alt=\"1124_lingumi-25\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding how a Taiwanese child thinks through their first language allows Lingumi to design learning materials that meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan. / Photograph: Lingumi</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a 5 or 6 year old Taiwanese child will already start thinking through the lens of their first language because the structure of language is more tied to the first language. Taking this into account, we will understand why when an Italian child or German child learns English, they would naturally be able to use plurals and say for example, “two dogs”, whereas a Taiwanese child might say “two dog”. Understanding how a Taiwanese child thinks through their first language allows Lingumi to design learning materials that meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As someone who loves to learn languages, Toby is currently learning Chinese which he considers as “one of the toughest challenges for a language learner.” Chinese is not an easy language to learn but Toby said it is important to learn this language if he wants to better engage at the local level with users in Taiwan. “I make a lot of videos for marketing, where I’m speaking Chinese and I want to just do that in an authentic way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the pandemic hit, Toby has traveled to Taiwan numerous times to meet families who use Lingumi. As for the future, Toby said that he would like to come back and visit more as he has loved every experience he had in Taiwan. “I do want to travel a lot more and come back to Taiwan a lot more frequently. Because for me, that is a very important way to connect to our customers to understand what they need from us. And that\'s how we build a better product — by listening to what our families want.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47559\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47559</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-01-05 06:44:01', '2022-01-05 06:44:01', NULL),

Therefore, JJ wanted to leverage AI to scale up and take part in the education startup business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to her venture in the startup sphere, JJ started out in the scientific field. Boasting a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Microelectronics at Peking University, she chose to start her career down the business path due to her interest in realizing ideas in product campaigns. She worked at Groupon and Huawei, excelling as the head of sales in both companies. “I think everyone is uncovering their purpose in life along the way. I’ve found my true passion in business.

I failed the first time. This experience led me to the decision of expanding my horizon in big corporations like Groupon and Huawei,” said JJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, JJ pursued an MBA degree from Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. “It got me thinking. What the most invaluable takeaway at MBA school should be,”said JJ Xu. “Most of my peers answered almost in unison, that ‘network resource’ and ‘communication skills’. Wouldn’t it be swell if we could scale and turn this into a business plan,” said JJ Xu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1642039266776.jpeg\" alt=\"speaker_speech_shutterstock_1170155062Resize 1280.\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>As an MBA graduate herself, JJ considered \"communication skills\" to be most valuable in terms of an MBA student.

Therefore, human-made suggestions fail to let you know the exact extent to which you should improve.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>TalkMeUp aims to paint a better picture of communication performance by means of data-based insights. “With our trained AI system, we analyze video, audio and speech content.

To check for consistency with high-level metrics such as emotions, NLP trained video and audio analyzer steps in to help with the identification.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1642039351517.jpeg\" alt=\"dashboard.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47574\">TalkMeUp\'s AI coach provides instant feedback based on 16 metrics, helping users become more confident, fluent and communicative in their business pitches. / Photograph : talkmeup</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47574\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47574\">\r\n\r\n	<p>Furthermore, customizable solutions are also an emphasis of TalkMeUp. Firstly, open API would allow TalkMeUp’s patented video analyzer to be integrated with preexisting learning platforms, such as that of Coursera or Udemy. “For users of the platform, they are empowered with a brand new way to practice speech,” said JJ.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Apart from open APIs, the metrics used to analyze communication performance will be altered according to the purpose of one’s speech. Elements that make a speech successful are entirely different between a school teacher and a sales person. “Bearing these differences in mind, customizing performance metrics is critical in the sense that communications want to raise awareness on different topics,” said JJ.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Currently, TalkMeUp adopts a tiered pricing strategy. Aside from depositing a lump sum fee upon subscription, additional charges are made when the user base continues to grow within the client company.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Determined to make it work</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>In Meet Global’s exclusive interview, JJ walked us through some difficulties she faced in entrepreneurship. “As a newcomer to the U.S., networks needed to be expanded so that business can run more smoothly,” said JJ. She constantly needs to bond with investors, other startup founders and potential work talent for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Furthermore, she said the pressure also came from whether she was able to obtain a work visa. “I was under such immense pressure that a few silver strands of hair started to grow,” said JJ.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Finally, she received an O-1 visa for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement. Taking a load off her mind, JJ said it’s still a long way to go before TalkMeUp hits success. “Regardless of raging storms in the path towards success, I will stand firm and carry on with my startup project,” said JJ firmly.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Visioning a global village: English, Mandarin, French and Russian services in progress</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>“We’re working hard to build a future in which everyone can access learning resources with no limitation and uncap their true potentials,” said JJ ambitiously.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The team is also seeing potential in other language markets. TalkMeUp salesperson learned from customer feedback that language portfolio is expected to be expanded. “Driven by the market demand, we are laying out plans to deliver services in Mandarin, French and Russian,” said JJ.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Chinese speaking world is TalkMeUp’s next big game. As a native Chinese speaker, JJ has been connecting with the Chinese market since 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>“Taiwan is one of our target markets. Before the pandemic, we had been keeping in touch with one of Taiwan’s leading online English tutor platforms,” said JJ. The popularity that English tutoring has received in Taiwan makes it an attractive destination for ed-tech startups like TalkMeUp.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Adding Mandarin services to its language portfolio is expected to expand its customer base and bring in more revenue. Having raised USD 1 million in the pre-seed round, TalkMeUp is preparing for seed round funding on the horizon.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47574\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47574</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-01-13 02:03:54', '2023-09-25 14:02:14', NULL),

How would you describe the relationship between VCs and startup founders?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> For Cherubic Ventures, we focus on investing in early-stage startups, so we participate from 0 to 1. We work with startups closely and provide them with advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> It is like dating and getting married. VCs and startups need to keep finding a way to get used to each other, finding a way to support each other — just like how married couples need to find a way to live with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> It depends on what kinds of VCs and startups. Different stages of VCs have different goals, and different stages of startups need different resources. Echoing what Joseph said, the relationship between VCs and startups is like getting married, because once you’re married it’ll always be messy when you want to get a divorce later on, just like when VCs invest in a startup and you cannot just pull back the money at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1642039826947.jpeg\" alt=\"黃立安_Joseph Huang_Partner at Infinity Ventures_2020\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partner of Headline Asia Joseph Huang feels the relationship between VC and startup is like dating and getting married. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Q. What factors do you consider before you invest in a startup? What has been your favorite investment deal in the past few years?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> Kiwibot is an investment deal that we’ve made recently that I’m very proud of. It develops food delivery robots and over 50 US colleges are already using their services. I really admire the diligence and toughness the founder has as an entrepreneur. The founder shows no fear in the face of difficulties and perseveres in solving problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> I’m very proud that we invested in Calm. The founder is a serial entrepreneur. When he was stressed, he relied on meditation to help him de-stress. He has always been practicing meditation and studying the science behind it but back at that time, people didn’t realize the potential of the mental health market. Founders of Calm met over 15 VCs at Silicon Valley but no one was interested. When I got a chance to chat with Calm’s founders, I could tell they are truly passionate about meditation and understand the positive impacts they could bring for others. When you truly love what you do, no matter what happens, you will keep going, and I knew they had the passion and ability to make it happen, so I invested in them immediately after meeting them in 2014. Now they have grown to a company with over 100 employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> Mine would be Blocto. The cofounder Hsuan Lee was the former VP of Engineering for COBINHOOD, a company with lots of Taiwanese blockchain talents. AppWorks invested in Flow, and Flow wanted to find some Taiwanese blockchain talents to collaborate and build the Flow ecosystem into a better place. Hsuan Lee foresaw the potential and built a crypto wallet. With the experience from COBINHOOD, Blocto\'s crypto wallet is very user-friendly, and this is also the app I use every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1642039881816.jpeg\" alt=\"心元資本 Cherubic Ventures_鄭博仁 Matt Cheng (2)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherubic\'s founding partner Matt Cheng is proud of investing in Calm. / Photograph : 心元資本</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Q. Tips for startups that are preparing to raise money?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> Founders need to know why they want to raise money and what is the purpose of the money. Once founders get the investment money from VCs, they will demand a return, so founders need to make sure they have great ideas that will yield good returns. In addition, VCs are not all the same. Different VCs have different missions and provide different resources. Founders should do some research to make sure they are talking with the right VCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> Founders shouldn’t wait until they need money to reach out to VCs. I met a lot of startups from Silicon Valley where no matter if you are interested in them or not, they would just keep sending you their company updates. By keeping in touch, VCs might start to get interested in you later on. Another tip is that I like to hear the disadvantages startups have. If they know their disadvantages, they can be careful about it and have more chances to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Q. There are some situations where popular startups get lots of potential investors. How do you win favor from startups and get the chance to invest in them?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> Our advantage lies in our expertise and understanding of the Japanese market, so I will say to the founders that we are the best choice for you if you want to get into the Japanese market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> Because we focus on investing in early-stage startups, we are a founder-friendly VC. We will help founders grow, supporting them every step of the way, and because we have a strong network of founders across the world, we can help connect them to different founder communities and markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> AppWorks has an accelerator, fund, and school, so these three pillars enable us to form a strong startup community. For example, when we invested in Flow, they told us they wanted to participate in our community and find the talents and resources they needed which we were able to provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47580\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47580</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-01-13 02:12:04', '2023-09-25 14:01:35', NULL),

I was struck by how closely Pinsker’s world matches our current circumstances, right down to the talk about finding “a new normal,” which has been a guiding principle in my investments since the beginning of this thing. Had I read the book when it was first published in 2019, I might not have been convinced that elaborate virtual worlds could go mainstream this decade, but 2 years of nonstop Zoom meetings and event cancellations have given me a different perspective.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n\r\n		<p>Also, despite the book’s ode to traditional live music and critique of the mainstream entertainment industry, I couldn’t help wondering if Pinsker has also been a VC in a past life. The pain points she lays out echo the exact same doubts I have about the feasibility of every metaverse-related project I’ve been pitched or have read about in the media. In the chapter “Little Boxes,” for example, Pinsker describes in vivid detail the kinds of technical and human-generated obstacles that startup founders gloss over in pitch decks, to the frustration of VCs everywhere.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These two points considered, as a VC myself who’s fascinated by how technology expands and shapes what we consider entertainment, I want to add that I’m more optimistic than Pinsker about the promise of metaverse entertainment — while still acknowledging the potential downsides. And I believe that we in venture capital have both the resources and responsibility to anticipate these downsides and invest accordingly. Luckily, the “metaverse” most people are envisioning is still a long way off, at least for mainstream audiences, which means there’s still time to build it thoughtfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, while we’re on the subject of the long-term future, I will refrain from getting into the inevitable revolution in consumer wearables that’ll transport us to the futuristic, fully immersive metaverse of science fiction. Immersive hardware has got to become as affordable, comfortable, and multifunctional as mobile phones while also providing a 1000% better experience — along the lines of the Hoodie™ Pinsker describes in A Song for a New Day. While we wait for hardware breakthroughs, the nascent metaverse is still going to be experienced by casual users through the devices we’ve already got, namely: phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>…Then again, judging by the fact that <a href=\"https://qz.com/2107700/metas-oculus-was-the-top-app-in-the-us-on-christmas/\">Oculus rocketed to #1 in the app stores for both iOS and Android over Christmas</a> and how <a href=\"https://uploadvr.com/vr-player-sales-numbers-christmas-2021/\">VR developers were celebrating spikes</a> as well, consumers are finally starting to believe <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/12/31/no-one-could-buy-a-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-this-christmas-so-they-bought-oculus-quest-2-vr-headsets/\">VR headsets are viable alternatives to consoles like the Xbox Series X or the PS5.</a> Yet another example of how COVID-19 and its supply chain disruptions are changing our habits in unexpected ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<iframe width=\"540\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5DpJlRbbgGU?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also not gonna focus on the “enterprise metaverse” technology that Microsoft and the Corporation Formerly Known as Facebook want to bring to your office. Let them duke it out for huge clients whose employees will still gripe about how <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/21/the-metaverse-will-make-your-meetings-worse/\">the latest metaverse meeting could have been an email.</a> As an early stage investor, I’m much more interested in the layer of purpose-built metaverse software tools that the heavyweights will neglect to build, leaving huge niches like entertainment open for forward-thinking startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while many VCs like me are old enough to remember the internet before modern SaaS, a lot of enthusiastic entrepreneurs out there are younger than the World Wide Web itself (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-the-world-wide-web\">which turned 30 just before the pandemic, by the way</a>). That means that the folks who’re really going to shape our virtual future may not have suffered through all the annoying growing pains (and therefore opportunities) that come with a technological shift like the one before us. So let’s take a step back to a time before social media, before smart phones, and even before Wi-Fi…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so not quite all the way back to 1912, but back to the early days of the web, before WYSIWYG page builders and payment gateways went mainstream. Anyone trying to build a reputation on the Internet (as it was known before we all got tired of capitalizing the “I”) mostly had to outsource their web presences. If you had neither the budget to hire a webmaster nor the bandwidth to build your own tech expertise, you got left out until good DIY tools came along. Heck, even Blogger and LiveJournal didn’t start until 1999, so it was hard to build online audiences if you weren’t active on listservs or IRC. And if you did have a mid-90s web presence, you couldn’t exactly do SEO because there weren’t really any SEs to O yet. (You could eventually, however, submit your link to “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1381316068468162560?s=20\">Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web.</a>”)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here in 2022, as long as you’ve got something special to offer (be it a music album, podcast, novel, physical good, or service) you don’t need to know even a lick of HTML to have a robust brand online. Build a <strong>Squarespace</strong> website as your home base. Design your cover art and online ads with <strong>Canva</strong>. Amass a paying audience for your ongoing work via Patreon, sell your finished work on platforms like <strong>Pinkoi</strong> or <strong>Steam</strong>, pre-sell your new release on <strong>Kickstarter</strong>, or get revenue from ads on your <strong>YouTube</strong> vids, and do it all without even leaving the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you need a device with a stable internet connection, some starting capital, and a lot of time and patience, and not everyone has all of these things. However, for those who do, the technical barriers to reaching an audience for your work have largely been toppled. You still have to have talent at whatever it is you do or make, but you don’t have to be (or hire) a full stack developer AND a full stack marketer just to be able to compete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, the parallels between the 1990s and the 2020s are becoming clearer here, and entrepreneurs who are pumped up about the possibilities of the metaverse are starting to take a step back and look at the landscape. While others are still busy figuring out better ways to mint NFTs or transposing existing websites and apps into VR without adding much value, what can you be building that really matters? What MetaSaaS tools can you build for musicians, educators, influencers, or SMEs so they won’t need a small fortune or an engineering team to be part of metaverse culture as it matures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>\r\n	<br>Joseph Huang is the Partner of Headline Asia.

The investors include Mucker Capital, Hyphen Capital, and Gaingels. The fund will help Worca to accelerate the expansion of Asia-Pacific region.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Worca is formerly known as <a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407\">MVP fastlance’s engineers recruiting business.</a> But during the Covid-19 pandemic, the co-founders Ti-Wen Lin and Jack Wu noticed that there was a strong need for recruiting remote engineering talents for the US’s tech companies. “The tech companies come for help to find engineers just skyrocketed. Noticing this strong demand, Jack and I spilled talent recruiting business off from MVP Fastlane and established Worca immediately,” said Ti-Wen, co-founder and CEO of Worca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taiwan\'s talent is exceptional. We are the few headhunters that could bridge demand from US-based tech companies and the talent supply from Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam\" said Jack Wu, co-founder and COO at Worca.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Worca platform helps you hire global talents effortlessly</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the post-covid era, working environments have changed tremendously. Companies started to hire more and more remote workers, and some even work from other countries. To catch up with the trend, Worca developed a SaaS one-stop destination platform to facilitate rapid hiring and onboarding of top talent, along with seamless integration of payroll, legal compliance, benefits, and other human resources functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worca’s SaaS platform features automated HR processes that enable clients to staff up with elite engineers and other tech professionals who will ensure that their businesses can successfully launch, grow and thrive. Its streamlined process lets clients build a global team at a speed with retention rates as high as 96%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Worca recently helped a large U.S. tech company build a sizable product team in Taiwan in advance of an IPO. The company was working with a tight budget and strict timeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worca’s team of experts quickly reached out to its network of recent and soon-to-be engineering graduates from top schools as well as experienced engineers looking for professional advancement or a change of scenery. Worca was able to hire 10 engineers per month on average and help to built a team of over 100 new hires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ti-Wen coined a unique strategy, Network Effect, which connects the elite talent and startups together. It shows that during the COVID-19, cross-border workers are still in high demand and Worca plays an important role to bridge the gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We were pleased to support businesses in building capable and successful teams using our automated global talent management platform,” said Ti-Wen. “When they need to grow further, our easily scalable solutions help match them with the right talent for their next phase.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While planning its expansion into Southeast Asia, South America and Europe, Worca will maintain its original primary recruiting base in Taiwan. They aim to be the largest recruiting platform in the Greater Southeast Asia region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47593\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47593</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-02-09 01:44:34', '2022-02-09 01:44:34', NULL),

(450, 'Foreign Talent in Taiwan: What obstacles will you meet?', '2022-02-22', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Taiwan is a hidden gem in Asia: It\'s a beautiful, safe and welcoming country to live in, and surveyed expats report being incredibly satisfied with their quality of life . However, for those foreigners who wish to start and grow a successful career here, it can be quite challenging. There are approaches you can take to make the roadblocks easier to bypass</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The topic of working in Taiwan as a foreigner is something I\'ve spoken about on multiple occasions. I\'ve had the pleasure of speaking at events discussing this issue hosted by All Hands Taiwan, The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, TAITRA and at a couple of job fairs. Within the foreigner community in Taiwan, this is the pervasive question: what are my options here professionally? I chose the sub-title of my article, not to suggest foreigners here are rough, but to allude to the difficult truth about living here as a foreigner: life in Taiwan is fantastic but the job prospects are not great. You have to accept the rough with the smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do the statistics say?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of 2019, there were <a href=\"https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141478/141380/209124/\">785,341 foreigners living in Taiwan</a>, 363,323 males and 423,018 females. Around 92% are from South East Asia and around 14,000 are from the larger English-speaking countries. The Ministry of Labor categorizes foreign workers into two major groups; Productive and Social Welfare and Special Professions or Technical Assignments. These categorizations are traditionally what is known as blue-collar and white-collar. The blue-collar labor market has 719,487 people working in mostly manufacturing and domestic nursing. Within the white-collar demographic, <a href=\"https://statdb.mol.gov.tw/html/mon/i0120020620e.htm\">here</a> are some of the noteworthy statistics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>5,084 in Education (4,367 of these people are cram school teachers)</li>\r\n	<li>19,929 in Specialized Technical Work (mostly engineers)</li>\r\n	<li>1,266 in Accommodation and Food Services</li>\r\n	<li>1,712 in Arts and Entertainment</li>\r\n	<li>3,118 Directors of Foreign Businesses (Country Managers, Taiwan GM)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purpose of this article, I will focus on what could be considered white-collar labor, as my own expertise regarding the blue-collar labor market here in Taiwan is limited. Unfortunately, I lack direct connections to these workers, companies, or working environments. My job focuses on recruiting mid-to-senior level white-collar talent in Taipei, and so this is the area I am most qualified to discuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who am I?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason I\'ve been asked to give presentations about this topic is that I work as a headhunter in Taiwan for a company called Paul Wright Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important part of my job is being hyper-aware of the labor market and hiring trends in Taiwan. It wouldn\'t be an exaggeration to say that internal human resource teams often rely on the market information that headhunters share with them. We trade in gossip and data. Effective and experienced headhunters will be experts on the job market they work within. I\'m also a foreigner, a young Scottish gentleman to be precise. As one of the few foreign recruiters in the market, I attract a lot of attention from foreigners seeking advice about the job market. I\'d say on average I speak to two or three different foreigners a week about their careers. These candidates all have unique professional backgrounds and the advice I give them depends heavily upon their individual situations. I want to talk a little about the different categories of jobs typical to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Education Industry</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For those professionals who have chosen education as their career, Taiwan has a lot of opportunities. There are thousands of kindergarten and cram school jobs available, as well as prestigious international schools for the more accredited teachers. There is a myriad of ways to pursue a career in education, be that teaching, opening your own school, coaching, editing textbooks, etc. I personally found teaching to be a difficult yet rewarding job and a lot of my friends here are in the industry. My take on it would be quite straightforward: if you enjoy working in this industry and feel challenged and fairly compensated, that’s great!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would however add that the majority of frustrated professionals I encounter here are teachers whose hearts aren\'t in it. I was in this category once myself. I taught English in Taiwan for four years before deciding to move to Shanghai with the intention of getting into something new. The gamble paid off and I’ve been working in the headhunting industry for seven years now. For foreigners who wish to transition from a teaching position into another industry, the battle is an uphill one. I’ll attempt to tackle the question, \"So what can I do to achieve this step?\", a bit later on in the article. But first I want to distinguish between people in this situation seeking advice, and the expats who are at the very top of the pyramid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expat Contracts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Expat contracts, as they are known in the industry, are given to foreign professionals who have been sent to work in the Taiwan branch office. This group of talent is sourced from headquarters and is usually very globally mobile throughout their careers. The expat General Managers of multinational businesses here are on a vastly different level from the average worker. Expat contracts include things such as rent, a driver, children\'s private education, flights home and massive salaries. The total cost of these people to the companies who hire them is often astronomical compared to the average worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this group of foreign professionals, there is not much I need to tell you. If you are being paid massive amounts of money to work in Taiwan and your contract runs out, finding a similar job here as a local hire is virtually impossible. For local hires, i.e. foreigners who already live in Taiwan who are applying for jobs here, we need to play the game alongside our Taiwanese colleagues. In most cases, local hire foreigners who work in the business are paid no more or no less than their Taiwanese colleagues. Unlike in the teaching industry, their foreignness doesn\'t entitle them to preferential treatment (and quite right!).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>But why is the job market so difficult for foreigners in Taiwan?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before advicing foreign professionals who wish to stay and build a career in Taiwan, I want to tackle the fundamental question at the core of the issue. Why is the job market in Taiwan limited and challenging for immigrants? This question is more than a little difficult to answer and I think taking it on as an MBA thesis topic would be an interesting endeavor (tempting!). The answer I most commonly give in private discussions is one that I\'m guessing will attract a degree of controversy. I think that one of the major reasons why there aren\'t a plethora of opportunities for foreigners in the professional market here is that Taiwan\'s history doesn\'t include large periods of European colonization. Major cities throughout the world, after undergoing long (and often brutal) periods of European rule, usually became more international and cosmopolitan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Places like Hong Kong and Shanghai grew to accept foreign businesses and businessmen as the norm. During the period of modernization in Taiwan however, the market was not heavily influenced by Western companies and people. Taiwan remains a largely homogenous society (the exception being the aboriginal community, whose own history and relationship with colonists is not without brutality and suffering). The effect is that Taiwanese businesses are mostly localized, they don’t have a history of hiring many foreign white-collar workers. Change is a slow process, and the reality is that the majority of businesses here have little experience hiring foreign professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current situation in the job market is that when given a choice between hiring a local who speaks English or a foreigner who speaks Chinese, the former wins almost every time. As an example, a large Taiwanese company that sells its products globally will have a workforce composed almost solely of Taiwanese employees. If this Taiwanese company is selling into the Russian market, they\'ll hire a Taiwanese person who speaks either Russian or just English to work in their sales team. It could be argued this is nonsensical - surely a marketing professional from Brazil is going to be more effective at marketing a product in Brazil than a Taiwanese local who has been randomly assigned that territory. However, this is not the norm in Taiwanese companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign businesses in Taiwan are sometimes even more localized, with 99% of the staff being Taiwanese. These multinationals would seem like a good place to start as a foreign professional looking to work in Taiwan. For instance, if you are from France, you might think that French companies such as L’Oréal, Pernod Ricard, Air Liquide and Chanel might hire you to work in their Taiwan office. It is definitely possible, and I won’t discourage anyone from trying. However, these companies are overwhelmingly localized for justifiable reasons, it makes sense to hire Taiwanese people to focus on their local market, where their native language and cultural understanding will help them make their employer financially successful. For example, L’Oréal hiring a French candidate to work in mid-level sales, marketing or supply chain is very uncommon. The only notable exception I’ve witnessed is global management trainee programs or brand ambassadors in the alcohol industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also isn’t a question of salary cost or working visa as I often hear. If you bring up the topic of this article to a Taiwanese professional, they will most often guess that companies are reluctant to pay higher salaries for foreigners or that the working visa is difficult to apply for. I don\'t think either of these excuses is correct, the minimum salary for a working visa (ARC) is 47,971 NTD per month which is at the very bottom end of the salary spectrum for professional jobs in Taiwan. Even junior-level employees can make between 60-90k per month. The working visa or ARC permit is also not difficult for companies to apply for and costs them only a small expense. Taiwan\'s working visa stipulations are very reasonable compared to many other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>\r\n	<br><strong>Alan McIvor</strong>\r\n	<br>Practice Leader at Paul Wright Group\r\n	<br>Alan McIvor is a Scottish headhunter based in Taipei with Paul Wright Group.

(451, 'Foreign Talent in Taiwan: the solutions for your obstacles', '2022-02-23', '', '<div data-aid=\"47419\">\r\n\r\n	<blockquote>\r\n\r\n		<p>After understanding the <a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47418\">situations foreigners would meet</a> when working or seeking jobs in Taiwan, the author provides some observations and suggestions for foreign talents.</p>\r\n	</blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<h2>So, what is the solution?</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>As with most complex problems, there are many things to consider when looking for answers. On a macro level, there are people and organizations slowly improving the situation for foreign professionals in Taiwan. Groups like All Hands Taiwan, the various Chambers of Commerce, Taipei City Mayor’s Office, and Crossroads are pulling things in a positive direction. The amount of lobbying that takes place in Taiwan on behalf of the foreign community is impressive. The situation is improving slowly thanks to these types of influencers and organizations. There is also the factor of learning from successful examples. If a company hires a foreigner and they perform well, they are more likely to hire other foreigners in an attempt to replicate the success. This growth is hopefully exponential. Performing well in a management job here helps all of your fellow foreigners in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>On an individual basis, there are many things you can do to improve your chances of getting a good job and building a successful career. Learning Chinese is probably a good idea in general for improving employability and quality of life. Networking is also a very good idea; knowing the right people can certainly open doors and guanxi remains an important force in the professional world. Studying something new and adding qualifications to your resume doesn’t hurt; things like coding courses, Google Analytics certificates or even a full MBA. If your resume is lacking in relevant work experience for the career you want, then adding anything to it will do you favors. Doing an internship or part-time project in your relevant field could make a world of difference. If you are a writer or artist, then focus on building a portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Acting and dressing professionally would also be advisable. If your haircut, jewelry and general attire aren’t super appropriate for a professional setting, then you are only making things difficult for yourself. Cut off those festival bracelets, take out the earring and buy a nice suit (these are actually all real examples from my past).</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Of course, none of the suggestions above are unique to the situation in Taiwan – the same advice would be relevant to any job seeker. So let’s get a bit more specific: what are the particular things that make you more employable in Taiwan? I’ll share a story from an American Marketing Director friend of mine who managed a team of Taiwanese and a team of foreigners in her company. She told me that decisions were made at the management level and then she would delegate roles for her two teams. The Taiwanese team would listen, write notes and then get on with it. The foreign team would listen, give their opinion and then argue about the strategy chosen by the higher-ups. My friend found this extremely frustrating and became reluctant to hire any foreigners who seemed to be too opinionated and individualistic.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The relevance of this story is that you shouldn’t expect to change Taiwanese working culture. If your behavior and attitude are too alien for the local Taiwanese colleagues to deal with, you won’t last long in a company here and certainly won’t be getting promoted any time soon. The best examples of successful foreign professionals I’ve seen are the people who adapt and understand the local culture. More specifically, this means understanding how to communicate a disagreement and how to speak with a Taiwanese boss. The subtleties are interesting and varied but ultimately you want to be considered an insider without losing the advantages of the outsider.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Job hunting strategies</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ultimately, the best way to approach looking for a job is using a combination of perseverance and creativity. I’ve covered the reasons why companies don’t often hire foreign talent, now it is your job to persuade someone why they should. Perseverance is paramount because often you’ll need to apply for lots of jobs, interview many times and work hard to improve your professional profile. Enduring failure and rejection will no doubt be a challenging and frustrating part of your job search. If you can overcome the defeatism that comes with rejection, you can slowly climb towards your goal and learn something from every setback.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Creativity in a job search refers to the ability of a person to try every option and think outside the box. For example, have you thoroughly covered all of these options:</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>1) Applied for jobs on LinkedIn and 104.com.tw</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>2) Used your current network to its fullest</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>3) Taken the time to build a new network of contacts through LinkedIn and events</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>4) Spent the time to craft an attractive resume and LinkedIn profile</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>5) Researched which companies hire foreigners</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The fifth point on the list above is usually the advice I give my foreign connections that they hadn’t previously thought of. If you’re going to look for opportunities in Taiwan, it makes sense to look for companies with a history of hiring foreign professionals. You can use LinkedIn and Google to do some market research; which companies currently employ foreigners and in what capacities? It makes sense that these firms will be easier to persuade to hire you. I previously worked for a large business in China where I was the first foreign hire. It was great fun, but it was a new experience for everyone involved and as a result lacked structure.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Another angle might be to look into the start-up market. If you speak to experts within the start-up community here in Taipei, they will share the same prognosis of the market: lots of great ideas but a significant lack of business acumen, sales, and marketing ability. If this sounds like a great opportunity for you personally, then you are starting to get the picture. Look for opportunities everywhere, around every corner. For a confident but inexperienced foreigner, a partnership with a start-up venture might be the right move. The start-up can use your natural sales acumen and creativity and you can have the advantage of being given a chance to shine. These kinds of jobs will probably not pay well initially, but your priority should be getting a foot in the door and earning relevant experience.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Growing your career in Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>If you are already on the career ladder in Taiwan and have more than a couple of years’ experience already, then perhaps I haven’t tackled your circumstances adequately enough. For this group of people, the real question is how do you build a solid and improving career here over several years? I’m actually going to tackle this question in more detail in a future article, so I won’t go into too much depth here. However, I’d still refer back to a previous point regarding compromising with the Taiwanese working culture. Over years this only becomes more relevant. Being promoted and given more responsibility within a company also means an increased need to communicate amicably within a hierarchy. The better you are at communicating with your boss, colleagues and subordinates, the higher you will climb in the business.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>If you work for a company where the Taiwanese staff vastly outnumber the foreign staff, cooperating well with your local colleagues and having them see you as an asset to the company can be the most obvious key to achievement. If you can find ways to exploit your differences and strengths, it will most likely be recognized internally. Find yourself allies within the business to help you with the harder tasks and work hard to prove your worth.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Is the market changing for the better?</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>It is quite clear that the current labor market for foreigners is a bit intimidating, which brings me to an important question: is the market changing for the better? If I had to speculate, I’d say the situation is improving for white-collar foreign labor. I personally would love to see more diversity in companies here. I’m a big believer in the advantages of a mixed workforce, hiring a variety of personalities and skills allows a company to utilize different employees for different needs. Having a charming and outgoing Sales Manager might be to your advantage while having your Finance and IT Heads to be more technically astute would make more sense. I’d extend this to foreign talent. For example, having a marketing team comprised of ten locals and one foreigner would allow a company to get a non-Taiwanese perspective on the ideas and strategies being discussed. A diverse workforce improves a business.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The government is also attempting to attract foreign talent to the island. There is a labor shortage in a number of <a href=\"https://sentinel.tw/china-foreign-workers-taiwan/\">technical professions</a> and the birth rate in Taiwan is amongst the <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201903250013\">lowest in the world</a>. Having said that, intentions don’t always translate into measurable results and improvements could definitely be made. Recent measures such as the introduction of the <a href=\"https://allhandstaiwan.com/2019/07/29/what-is-the-taiwan-employment-gold-card/\">Gold Card program</a>, setting up Contact Taiwan, and a general willingness by the government to engage in discussion with the influential individuals within the foreign business community. Some rumors working visa stipulations will be lowered by the end of 2020. The restrictions around minimum wage, two years of experience, and holding a bachelor’s degree are all being <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/04/21/2003669125\">considered and reviewed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ultimately, any change will be slow and gradual. Successful examples of foreigners working here will lead to more companies taking a chance on hiring foreign talent. The best changes I’ve witnessed recently have been the result of efforts by a few close friends of mine. Daniel Miller runs a company called Pagoda Projects that partners with Universities from the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in placing interns into companies in Taiwan. I think this is brilliant. Before this kind of semi-governmental project came into Taiwan, there were very few examples of foreigners being given a chance in entry-level roles. I can guarantee that companies who hire strong-performing interns will be more likely to start increasing their openness to hiring foreign talent. Crucially, it is a much less risky investment for the Taiwanese business to hire an intern for six months. Interns are a company’s gateway drug into the world of office place diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The next positive organization I’d like to mention by name is All Hands Taiwan. Before All Hands Taiwan came into being, you could feel the palpable frustration and anger emanating from the online job boards and discussion groups. On the Facebook group, “Non-Teaching Jobs in Taiwan” the comments under job postings were frequently confrontational and aggressive. The admins of the group work incredibly hard with their volunteered time and it was often repaid with ingratitude. I watched several comment threads get completely out of control. All Hands Taiwan aims to offer an alternative to this negativity, creating a community of events and discussions centered around collecting practical and actionable advice from people who know what they’re talking about. This has allowed the foreign community to grow and learn from each other’s experiences. I have high hopes for these kinds of efforts and will continue to do anything I can to support people like John Murn, who are combining good intentions with good ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>The foreigner\'s dilemma: To stay or to go?</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>The decision about whether to stay in Taiwan or move home is one that many people agonize over. Once you consider that you might not be able to have a successful career here, it makes sense to weigh your options. For some professionals, moving to Shanghai, Singapore, Bangkok or back home might be the best play. The market in Taiwan for foreigners is worse than in many major international cities. The decision will have to be considered alongside many factors and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Moving back to your native country might be the best option if you wish to have an easier career ladder. It makes sense that ambitious professionals are more likely to hit their full potential in their home market. However, if you’ve already lived overseas for many years, going back home and attempting to start in a new market might be comparably frustrating. I would recommend everyone to analyze their situation and consider all factors. I give individualized advice about this kind of decision on a regular basis if you want to contact me on LinkedIn.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Taiwan is a hidden gem in Asia: It’s a beautiful, safe and welcoming country to live in, and surveyed expats report being incredibly satisfied with their quality of life. However, for those foreigners who wish to start and grow a successful career here, it can be quite challenging. There are approaches you can take to make the roadblocks easier to bypass, and the market is potentially changing for the better and becoming more open. However, this progress will probably be slow. The path you choose and the decisions you make about your career will ultimately need to be determined by your own individual situation. Maybe with some tips from a headhunter ;)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>\r\n	<br><strong>Alan McIvor</strong>\r\n	<br>Practice Leader at Paul Wright Group\r\n	<br>Alan McIvor is a Scottish headhunter based in Taipei with Paul Wright Group.

The requirements include \"being skilled in technology, meeting a certain salary level, and working for five years after applying,\" reported the <a href=\"https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/3832001\">Liberty Times.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two major categories in which blue-collar workers can apply: industry and social welfare. Eligible industry sectors include manufacturing, construction, marine fishing, and agriculture. The social welfare category includes caregivers in long-term care homes, live-in caregivers, and those employed in other designated key national industries, according to CNA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for minimum salary requirements, foreigners working in the industry category should make more than NT$33,000 per month or their total annual salary should be more than NT$500,000. For the social welfare category, caregivers in long-term care homes should make more than NT$29,000 per month and live-in caregivers should earn more than NT$24,000 a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-skilled workers and caregivers must also obtain a work license, accumulate at least 80 hours in training, pass a language proficiency test, and complete 20 hours of vocational training courses. However, workers who receive a monthly salary of NT$35,000 per month or more are exempt from these additional requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once blue-collar workers in either category have worked as \"intermediate skilled manpower\" for five years, they may apply for permanent residence in accordance with the Immigration Act (入出國及移民法), but they must earn a monthly gross salary of NT$50,000. Alternatively, they can obtain a Level B professional technician certificate, which can be acquired through authorized government training programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June of last year, the Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of a draft amendment of the <a href=\"https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0030295\">Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals</a> (外國專業人才延攬及僱用法). Among other incentives, the amendment relaxed the rules for obtaining permanent residence for white-collar \"foreign special professionals,\" but this did not apply to blue-collar workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the opening of Taiwan\'s borders to foreign migrant workers. The number of migrant workers peaked at 719,487 in February 2020 but dropped to <a href=\"https://statdb.mol.gov.tw/html/mon/c12060.pdf\">669,992</a> by December 2021, as the borders had been closed to them due to the surge of local COVID cases that summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1646185482715.jpeg\" alt=\"Workforce Development Agency\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photograph : Workforce Development Agency</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Read more news on <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4446266\">Taiwan News</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47604\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47604</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-03-02 01:46:55', '2023-09-25 14:00:19', NULL),

He aimed at joining Japans’ boxing contest. To achieve his dream, he worked as a salesperson for a famous English learning platform with a high salary. Finally, he accumulated enough money to go to Japan to pursue his boxing career. Unfortunately, he got injured and had to give up his dream.</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47603\">\r\n\r\n	<p>He returned to Taiwan, where he decided to rejoin the business he was most familiar with: the language learning business.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>“There are many choices for language learning students, and every platform is dedicated to providing the best services for students. But I decided to launch a platform that provides tutors the best services,” said Abner.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In 2017, Abner launched AmazingTalker. To encourage tutors to spend more time teaching classes and improving their teaching quality, AmazingTalker would decrease the platform’s host fee as tutors spent more time on the platform. For example, a tutor might have no platform fee once he earns over $3,000 USD per month. At this point, he would only need to pay the 8% handling fee.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The company’s core value is to maximize tutors’ earning potential by setting their fees independently.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Besides the special commission system that drives tutors to keep improving their teaching quality, AmazingTalker generates insights through data analysis of user behavior to help tutors continuously improve the quality of their teaching services. This enables AmazingTalker to use algorithms to match students and tutors precisely and efficiently within a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>AmazingTalker also provides an interactive learning environment that supports independence for both teachers and learners. Students can communicate their needs directly with prospective tutors without a binding contract or long-term payment obligation.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The global appetite for learning continues to grow. According to UNESCO, 470 million people will seek higher education over the next 15 years, a figure that far outstretches university capacity and that underscores the need for alternative learning sources. By 2026, the total global e-learning market is set to nearly double its 2019 level, landing at an astronomical $400 billion according to Statista.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>With the current stellar growth trajectory, the Taiwan-based AmazingTalker website aims at expanding their global business further.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47603\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47603</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-03-02 02:06:06', '2023-09-25 14:00:00', NULL),

Despite the success of its first product launch, Han quickly realized <strong>he needed to pivot his business to software solutions if he wanted Lucid to survive in the fiercely competitive startup environment.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, we got to sit down with Han to talk about the opportunities and challenges he faced to build a startup from the ground up and how he pivoted from hardware to software while remaining true to his vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1647502718045.jpeg\" alt=\"Lucid X Meet Global_2022-03-01_侯俊偉攝影_ (4)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LucidCam, the first VR180 3D camera for consumers. / Photograph: Meet</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Turning his startup dream into reality and earning a coveted spot on ‘Forbes 30 Under 30’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Han’s dream of having his own startup came to him when he was studying towards a Masters degree in Engineering at UC Berkeley. “Being a student there, you got the opportunity to hear from a lot of entrepreneurs, founders and success stories. It was a very supportive and inspiring environment where you’d have moments where you catch yourself thinking: ‘Why can’t I be the next big thing?’”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his degree he went into product management and operations in technology and went on to work at flash memory manufacturer Sandisk for 3 years as a product manager in the cameras department. He was fascinated with camera technology so he started to think about how he could build a powerful camera, capable of creating immersive 3D experiences, the same way our eyes see the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But back then, cameras were not yet powerful enough to generate 3D content so when he founded Lucid in 2015, he first needed to build his own hardware that would have the level of processing power he required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was still based in the U.S. at that time when he heard about Garage+, a global incubator for startups in Taiwan, so he applied for its Global Startup Programme and came to Taiwan to seek out opportunities. He demoed at <a href=\"https://meettaipei.tw/\">Meet Taipei</a>, the largest tech startup trade show in Asia, and started to form his industry connections with manufacturers in Taiwan which led him to getting his first investment for his startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By building strong connections and raising enough capital, Han launched LucidCam, the first VR180 3D camera for consumers, and shipped thousands of units to Amazon, Best Buy and other major retailers. This successful launch was even recognized by Forbes which featured him on its ‘<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/han-jin/?sh=48d96df21c05\">30 Under 30</a>’ list under consumer technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting up shop in Taiwan to build a strong software development team</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But a startup story isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Raising capital for a hardware startup is difficult as Han begins to explain why he needed to pivot his business into the software side of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our first product was a great success but to build the next iteration of the camera, you will need to raise millions of dollars in capital again because you’ve already spent all your funds building the first one. This investment cycle proved to be really demanding. So I started to think that maybe it was time to focus on software solutions because GPUs in every device such as our phones were becoming more and more powerful, so I didn’t see the need of building my own hardware anymore. My company vision has always been the same — bringing people closer together by creating and sharing immersive viewing experiences — but we needed to adapt to find an economical and sustainable business model.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traveling back and forth to Taiwan over the years took its toll on Han and he decided to set up an office in Taiwan in 2018. That’s when he met Jonathan Liao at Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA), who is the founder of Futuerward and director of the Gold Card project, and suggested to Han to get a Gold Card Visa which has many benefits for foreign professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1647502744398.jpeg\" alt=\"Lucid X Meet Global_2022-03-01_侯俊偉攝影_ (3)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han Jin with Jonathan Liao, Project Director at the Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office / Photograph: Meet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it like to set up shop and run a startup in Taiwan? “There’s an advantage of building a strong and agile team in Taiwan because of the great talent here and that’s what we did when we transitioned to software development,” says Han.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that Han pointed out about the talents here in Taiwan is that they excel in execution and implementation of projects. “Areas like customization and customer engagement, Taiwanese are really good at it.

Even though our company vision never changed, transitioning into a software business had its challenges because you just don’t know how everyone on your team will feel about it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of how he recruited new talent for software development, Han said: “When you’re shifting your business, it’s important to have new strategies on how to recruit new talent and know how to assess if they\'re the right people for the company.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major challenge Han faced was how to convince customers that you’re good business and show investors your commitment. “You have to be very clear about your business model. Shifting your business means you have to impress stakeholders by showing that you can learn about a new space more quickly than everyone else. And you have to emerge as an expert — being able to do that is hard because you have to make a lot of effort in order to learn faster and deeper than everyone else.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You can\'t be fixated with just one direction,” as Han continues to discuss the learning curve he went through. “Look at Slack for example, when it decided to pivot that’s when it took off.” But even though being flexible is important in running a startup, Han also added that if you do decide to pivot or shift your business direction, you have to keep in mind that it needs to be well-reasoned. “You need to back up your assessment and decisions with data and research to show you really know what you\'re doing and how you’re moving your business in the right direction.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The race is on to build the smartest AI brain in the industry</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By pivoting to software, Lucid is now a digital content platform that leverages AI to help businesses manage and scale videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Han gave us a demonstration of Lucid’s AI system in his office in Taipei, showing how it can learn to recognize faces, actions and even speech in videos. By analyzing all the data presented in the video, the platform edits and finalizes different video clips for customers to choose from. “Our AI can generate different topics for a user to choose from, for example, ‘Conversational’, ‘Action’ or ‘Romance’ and many other topics, and our platform can edit videos according to the chosen topic.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does all of this help businesses? “We consume content so fast now we have a content supply and demand mismatch in the market. So if you’re an influencer or a business who needs to create videos on a regular basis, we can help you save time and cost on manual editing and help businesses keep up with the consumer demand,” explains Han.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1647502782857.jpeg\" alt=\"Lucid_Portal.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucid\'s portal interface / Photograph : Lucid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He goes on to mention how they’re helping one of their customers, VEVO, who has hundreds of thousands of videos that need to be edited fast, and quickly uploaded across platforms. “We work with them to edit and build engaging viewer experiences across their social media platforms. It\'s a very personalized and efficient editing service and because our AI can remember client preferences, the efficiency and the quality of our work will keep on improving as the client feeds more data into our AI.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, Lucid already has over 5 million customers worldwide using their services and products. As its AI becomes more intelligent from the huge amounts of data it processes every day from video content, the startup is also analyzing the collated data to build better AI solutions that are made specifically for different scenarios and applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are now talking with many automation and manufacturing clients in Taiwan and training our AI to make sure it’s adaptable and suitable across different industries and production sites,” says Han.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competing in a crowded market such as the AI industry is not easy, and Han believes the companies that can stand out from the crowd will be those who can build the most intelligent AI software. “It’s all about the race to build the smartest AI brain in the industry and that’s what we’re aiming for.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47635\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47635</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-03-17 07:40:56', '2023-09-25 13:59:16', NULL),

(466, 'How CakeResume is taking on LinkedIn to become the largest social network for professionals in Asia', '2022-04-11', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>It’s been five years since we last interviewed Trantor Liu, founder and CEO of CakeResume. He has now built it from a single-person startup to a strong 30+ team with more than 2.2 million registered users worldwide and a growing talent pool of 500,000+ resumes on its database. Now after a successful seed round from Mynavi, one of the largest staffing firms in Japan, they are ready to take on an even bigger share of the market. “We want to be the Asian equivalent of LinkedIn and become the largest social network for professionals in the APAC region.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re working in the tech industry in Taiwan, chances are you’ve probably heard of CakeResume already. This fast-growing professional network not only helps job seekers build resumes, it also works with numerous tech companies such as Amazon Web Services, Google, MediaTek and TSMC to help them recruit tech talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, a lot has happened since we last interviewed Trantor Liu, founder and CEO of CakeResume, five years ago. From his early startup days as a one man band to now leading a 30+ team that helps millions of users worldwide, Trantor has come a long way since he founded CakeResume. Naturally, we were curious to have a chat again with him to discuss how he steered his startup into a successful business and what ambitious plans he has for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Taking on LinkedIn to build the largest tech talent pool in Asia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CakeResume has now surpassed 2.2 million users worldwide and is actively expanding into the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, Indonesia is a fast-growing market they are focusing heavily on. “Our strategy is that we provide lots of UI languages and we will look at the conversion rate from landing page to registered users. For Indonesia, we saw a high conversion rate of around 40%, so we saw an opportunity there and started investing in marketing and local influencer campaigns to build our online presence in the region. Now if you type in keywords such as \'CV maker\' in Indonesia, we will appear in the top 3 search results.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1649664124707.jpeg\" alt=\"CakeResume 2.2million users.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CakeResume has plans to build the largest tech talent pool in Asia / Photograph : CakeResume</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the strategy of how they built up their talent pool in Taiwan, Trantor explains when it comes to international expansion, the first step remains the same which is to develop a big database of potential candidates. “We will continue to invest and build up our talent pool in Indonesia because once you achieve enough users, businesses will come to you asking for help to recruit talent.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is his end goal for expanding into APAC? “After a successful seed round from Mynavi, we are even more ambitious now to take on a bigger share of the market. We want to be the Asian equivalent of LinkedIn and become the largest social network for professionals in the APAC region.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trantor says although CakeResume shares many similarities with LinkedIn, one key differentiation that sets them apart is how they build resumes for job seekers. “Our competitive advantage is that our platform designs and personalizes resumes that can best showcase the skills and experiences of job seekers in the digital world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1649664124753.jpeg\" alt=\"CakeResume\'s partnerships.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CakeResume works with thousands of high-profile companies to help them with tech recruitment / Photograph : CakeResume</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accelerating growth with new partnerships and product features</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CakeResume is rapidly growing its partnerships with big tech companies such as Google and TSMC, where effective tech recruitment is instrumental to business success. “When you look at the job listings from TSMC, you’d see that all the jobs are tech-related. Finding the right tech talent is not easy, so it’s a testament to us that companies of all sizes are coming to us to access our talent pool of tech specialists.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trantor says they attract a lot of tech workers and software specialists because the way they design resumes breaks the rules of traditional resumes. “Our resumes are built in a multimedia format and job seekers can be very creative in terms of how they showcase and demonstrate their strengths. So our platform attracted tech talents right from the beginning because we know how to help them show themselves in the best light.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1649664178583.jpeg\" alt=\"CakeResume Example.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CakeResume helps job seekers build customized resumes / Photograph : CakeResume</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support its growth, CakeResume continues to innovate its platform with new features such as the ability to set up a public profile, a chat function for employers to reach out directly to candidates, and a Grammarly-like feature to help proofread resumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another feature to highlight is the ‘Portfolio’ section where anyone can upload articles, photos and various other projects they’ve accomplished. “We have a strong tech talent pool but we also want to expand and build our presence across all industries. By introducing ‘Portfolio’, we want to encourage everyone to showcase their work and talent; for example, if you’re in the retail/hospitality industry, you can create an album of all the dishes you’ve made,” says Trantor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1649664178446.jpeg\" alt=\"劉君羿_Cakeresume CEO\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trantor Liu discusses how he built CakeResume from the ground up and his ambitions for the future / Photograph: 蔡仁譯攝</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From humble beginnings to a successful startup</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking about his entrepreneurial journey, Trantor said he has always been ambitious and always wanted to build great products that can impact millions. At the beginning it was hard when it was just himself trying to build something from the ground up but he said that was all part of the learning process because it meant he could learn everything from business development to marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now when it comes to managing his team he says he knows how to support each department and give them the resources they need. “I come from a software background but from the beginning I knew as a startup founder, I can’t just focus on deep tech; I need to know everything across the business so I know how to build my brand as well as developing great products.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He still remembers the humble beginnings of his bootstrapped startup where his initial capital came from his own personal savings. He worked 18-hour days and to save time and money he <strong>even took care of all his meals at convenience stores every day for at least 6 months.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Looking back on my journey, I feel very lucky that everything just came together for me. For example, our seed round investment happened just when we needed it — I feel like sometimes it comes down to luck for things to fall into place at the right time.

(469, 'An E-bike specially made for the food delivery fleet will be sold from Taiwan to the world', '2022-04-26', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>“Taiwan is the world headquarters for the bike industry,” said Swedish series entrepreneur Elias Ek, who has lived in Taiwan for 22 years. With the abundant supply of engineers and bikes parts in Taiwan, Keego was founded for building electronic bikes that are used for food delivery, according to Elias. And the startup eyes for the markets in Europe and North America, sending these professional e-bikes overseas.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Solve the pain point: A professional vehicle for food delivery</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1651043750076.jpeg\" alt=\"Keego Elias \" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish series entrepreneurs Elias Ek and Irish Philip founded Keego, the first e-bike company for the food delivery industry. / Photograph : Keego</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keego, the startup that builds e-bikes for food delivery, was born in a golden age. The food delivery industry is exploding. It’s now a global market worth more than $150 billion, tripling its values in 2017, according to <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ordering-in-the-rapid-evolution-of-food-delivery\" target=\"_blank\">Mckinsey</a>. Moreover, the global bicycle market reached US$59.3 billion in 2021 and predicts an 8.2% of annual growth rate over the next eight years, according to <a href=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2022/03/bicycle-industry-production-challenges-record-growth/\" target=\"_blank\">Amcham Taiwan</a>. To switch to a greener and healthier lifestyle, more and more people opt for bicycles to commute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philip Corri, founder of Keego from Ireland, had observed these trends and found that: no one is actually producing e-bikes specifically for the food delivery industry. Keego was thus launched to fill the gap. As the food industry keeps growing at a skyrocketing rate, the startup is building e-bikes for food delivery to solve the pain point, said Elias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, food delivery drivers mostly ride scooters, which is costly and harmful to the environment. According to the research of Keego, drivers who ride scooters on average spend 20% of their profits on gas, not including the cost of acquisition and maintenance. As for in Europe, drivers usually ride consumer bikes to deliver the food. It’s because some metropolitans often have the problem of traffic congestion. Like in London, the average speed from one site to another is 8 km/h. But consumer bikes are not built for delivery, as they can’t carry heavy loads and are not durable enough for long distances and long hours of working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“There are over 4 million food delivery drivers in Europe,” said Elias, “professional delivery bikes are in high demand.” Keego offers a complete solution for delivery companies to be green and profitable. With a total load capacity of 65 kg, Keego’s latest e-bike KG4 can reach a maximum speed of 25 km/h, and its battery capacity could support a 120 km-drive range.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Based in Taiwan for two decades, Keego founder Philip and Elias team up to build e-bikes with IoT systems</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1651043781006.jpeg\" alt=\"KG4 in Berlin\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keego\'s team is experienced at producing well-integrated software and hardware, according to Elias. / Photograph : Keego</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, both Elias and Philip worked in PaceBlade, a startup company in Taiwan which has introduced tablet PCs, 10 years before Apple came out iPad. Back then, the device acts as an LCD desktop, notebook, and tablet PC all in one, acquired by NASA and The International Space Station (ISS). The company had run for one year and a half and was sold to a Dutch company. The two pals had embarked on different paths in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elias has launched Enspyre, a Telemarketing and Phone Answering services provider. Enspyre provides telemarketing services to large companies and phone answering services to small and medium-sized companies, which equips Elias with rich experiences in B2B business models. On the other hand, Philip has started several Taiwan-based startups, working on software and hardware integration and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, Philip wanted to start something new. He invited Elias to join the team. “With 15 years of experience, Philip is well capable of building both software and hardware, which are well-integrated,” said Elias, “we have the mindset of creating products that are well suited to the market, and that’s Keego’s advantage to be the one that produces the smart e-bikes for food delivery.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Keego KG4 delivery e-bike has a built-in IoT module that allows constant communication between the drivers and the manager. In Europe, food delivery drivers use vehicles appointed by companies instead of their own vehicles, as the drivers are turning into full-time employees. The drivers’ app and fleet manager portal are always connected. The drivers’ app also keeps track of data about current speed, battery power, GPS location, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Eying for the global market: food delivery e-bikes can adapt to different cultures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1651043813606.jpeg\" alt=\"KG4 in Berlin\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, food delivery companies are searching for professional e-bikes to build their own delivery fleet. / Photograph : Keego</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We value what customers want, what the market wants,” said Elias. Keego has run a lot of tests on streets as well as market surveys. It turns out that drivers in Taiwan are interested in getting a food delivery e-bike for themselves, as e-bikes are cheaper than scooters, eco-friendly, and easier to find a parking spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keego customized its products according to the regions. For the Taiwanese market, the company sells its sturdy e-bikes for food delivery. As for European and U.S. markets, it will go for the in-built IoT e-bikes fleet. In Europe, contract drivers are turning into full-time employees due to law regulations. Delivery companies need to provide vehicles for the drivers, guaranteeing the delivery quality and the coordination.</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47670\"><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1651043846539.jpeg\" alt=\"Keego\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47670\">Keego has run a lot of tests on streets as well as market surveys. / Photograph: Keego\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br>\r\n\r\n	<p>Keego is actively expanding the global market of food delivery e-bikes. The startup has opened its sales office in Berlin, Germany, and has been talking to five unicorns in the delivery industry. Keego also plans to hire sales managers in Asia and North America by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>“When I was talking to customers in Sweden two months ago, they thanked us for manufacturing e-bikes for the food delivery industry.

Under the program, which has been dubbed \"3+4,\" COVID case contacts must undergo home isolation for three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the fourth day, the contacts must take a rapid antigen test, and if the result is negative they will be allowed to end their home isolation. However, they must then observe four days of self-health monitoring protocols, such as avoiding eating in restaurants, attending large events, and wearing a mask at all times in public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lo said that given that 99.5% of local cases since Jan. 1 have been mild or asymptomatic, and in order to maintain a normal life for the country\'s residents, the strategy has shifted to reserving quarantine facilities and medical resources for high-risk groups and those with moderate and severe symptoms. Lo reported that Su agreed in principle with the new shortened home isolation policy and the narrowed range for people listed as contacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lo said that since the preparation of supporting facilities and related details require the cooperation of local governments, the CECC will consult with county and city officials on the new policy as soon as possible before setting up an implementation date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more news on <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4517908\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan News</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47672\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47672</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-04-27 07:21:36', '2022-04-27 07:21:36', NULL);

The GSER is the world’s most comprehensive, data-driven research on startups with 280+ entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems and 3 million startups analyzed. Agricultural technology, as a sub-sector, captures the use of technology in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture aimed at improving yield, efficiency, and profitability through information monitoring and analysis of weather, pests, soil, and air temperature. New Food employs innovation to optimize food design, creation, diversity, distribution, and utilization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agtech &amp; New Food Edition explores technology-based startups with a focus on improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability – including drones, alternative proteins, vertical farming, waste management, and more, along with a ranking of the top Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems globally. Key highlights from the Agtech &amp; New Food Edition include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● The top five Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems are Silicon Valley, New York City, London, Tel Aviv-Jerusalem, and Denver-Boulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● North America and Asia dominate the top 25 Agtech &amp; New Food ranking, with 48% and 20% respectively. Europe has four ecosystems in the top 25, Oceania has two, and MENA one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● The amount of Series B+ deals in Agtech &amp; New Food worldwide rose from $3.8 million in 2017 to $11.5 million in 2021. North America accounted for 70% of Series B+ deals in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● Due to shifts in consumer behavior and rapid innovation in the sub-sector (including pandemic-driven changes), the share of food and grocery delivery deals has climbed steadily in recent years. In 2021, delivery accounted for 11% of the $1.6 billion invested in Agtech &amp; New Food, up from just 2% of total dollar amount invested in the sub-sector in 2017 and 6% in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>● Startups that create vegan products (both food and other items) and non-cultivated meat alternatives overtook cultivated meat in terms of deal amount at the seed stage in 2021, suggesting increasing early-stage innovation in the meat alternative field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Agtech &amp; New Food is one of the most attractive sub-sectors given its strong growth and it offering much needed global solutions to food disparity as well as environmental and employment sustainability,” shares JF Gauthier, Founder &amp; CEO of Startup Genome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the report, Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems are ranked based on many weighted factors including: economic performance, concentration of startups, sub-sector strengths, engineering talent, and level and growth of early-stage funding. The report includes contributed articles from Agtech &amp; New Food experts such as Caroline Bushnell of The Good Food Institute and Amy Wu of From Farms to Incubators.

People start getting used to buying tons of clothes but only wearing them once. The pile of discarded clothes has become a serious environmental problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taelor tries to solve the problem by not only providing a clothing rental subscription service but also hiring top stylists to help pick the clothes. They are trying to leverage AI to pick the clothes for customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The future of menswear is access, not ownership,” said Anya Cheng, co-founder and CEO of Taelor, “Our mission is to help people to look good, achieve goals and save the environment.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The younger generation is a lot more fashion conscious because of social media, and they also support sustainability and buy second-hand clothes. That’s why Taelor is really the perfect solution for many young men who want to look good but own less,” said Phoebe Tan, co-founder and COO of Taelor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When customers first sign up at Taelor, they fill out a style questionnaire and then receive a personal consultation with one of Taelor’s stylists. Then the stylists, along with artificial intelligence, select clothes for the customers based on their personal preferences. The clothes are shipped directly to customers, who can either wear them for weeks and return them or purchase them for up to 70% off the regular retail price. Customers then receive another box of clothes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a flat monthly fee of $88 per month, customers get up to two boxes of clothes per month.Four items will be in each box, including dress shirts, jackets, polo shirts, henley shirts and more. Taelor plans to add pants to its offerings soon. Dry cleaning and shipping are free both ways — making the process of renting and returning clothing effortless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to serving individual customers, Taelor plans to work with corporations to offer its subscription service as a perk or gift for employees and clients, as well as leverage its unique data to help brands and retailers predict trends and reduce unsold inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taelor is like a launching pad for clothing brands,” Cheng said. “As a SaaS data company, we help brands and retailers test products, find new customers, and discover consumers’ true preferences.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1652405369796.jpeg\" alt=\"Taelor和Tim Draper\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taelor won first place at legendary investor Tim Draper’s startup competition, Draper Demo Day. / Photograph : Taelor</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taelor has received lots of attention and recognition.

How can the two join forces and take on the heating semiconductor challenge endorsed by leading tech companies around the globe?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The semiconductor industry has grabbed the headlines with titles such as “soaring revenue”. Amid the semiconductor frenzy, few places in the world can compare with Taiwan, where a complete and robust semiconductor supply chain has gained a firm ground in the global market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading IC design company MediaTek hit record revenue last year, while wafer equipment manufacturer Applied Material and ASML ramps up talent recruitment on the island. Not to mention the one and only foundry giant TSMC, regarded as the “guardian angel” of Taiwan, is ranked top semiconductor company in terms of market cap, which amounts to $468 billion in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8000 kilometers away, a country off the coast of the glistening Mediterranean Sea also boasts uncomparable advantage in the semiconductor industry—Israel. Known as the start-up country, Israel enjoyed a stream of foreign investments in the tech sector, receiving a staggering amount of $25.6 billion in 773 deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One company that shone particularly bright is proteanTecs. proteanTecs is a software company founded in Haifa, Israel in 2017, providing chip monitoring platform that enables big tech companies to preempt failures and improve efficiency via data insights. Its innovative approach is trusted mainly by automakers, data centers and the mobile communications industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1652409314537.jpeg\" alt=\"proteanTecs 共同創辦人\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several co-founders of proteanTecs previously co-founded Mellanox, a supplier of computer networking products acquired by Nvidia for US$7 billion in 2019, which is by far the biggest deal carried out by Nvidia. / Photograph : proteanTecs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several co-founders of proteanTecs previously co-founded Mellanox, a supplier of computer networking products acquired by Nvidia for US$7 billion in 2019, which is by far the biggest deal carried out by Nvidia. “Our founders have long been in the electronics and semiconductor industry, therefore the connection of the field was already there,” said Yuval Bonen, co-founder and VP of Software at proteanTecs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seasoned expertise and vast experience in the industry paved the way for a collaboration between proteanTecs and TSMC as well as MediaTek. proteanTecs was included in the catalog of the TSMC Silicon IP alliance, and was later awarded Partner of the Year in 2021, which recognizes TSMC’s ecosystem partners’ pursuit of excellence. MediaTek foresaw proteanTecs technology\'s potential and decided to invest in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collaboration between Taiwan and Israel has proven a mighty one. “Israel has niche expertise, which complements Taiwan’s robust and complete supply chain,” said Bonen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, proteanTecs’ <a href=\"https://www.proteantecs.com/news/proteantecs-uct-supports-tsmc-3nm-process-technology-to-accelerate-lifecycle-health-monitoring\" target=\"_blank\">solutions support the latest 3-nm processes</a> by TSMC. On TSMC customers’ part, health and performance monitoring has proven to be beneficial. As leading foundries around the world compete for leading market position, more tailored and innovative services are critical to striking a difference between rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The eyes and ears of chips</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this modern day, electronics are practically everywhere. From mobile phones, EVs to datacenters, chips are key components that make the world go around. However, chip health and performance monitoring is a challenge that most manufacturers are not ready to take on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/technology/computer-chips-errors.html\" target=\"_blank\">research article</a> published by the New York Times, titled “Tiny Chips, Big Headaches”, illustrates the problem of hardware malfunction detection. “As the tiny switches in computer chips have shrunk to the width of a few atoms, the reliability of chips has become another worry for the people who run the biggest networks in the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chip errors are even dubbed the “Achilles heel” of major semiconductor companies. Intel, Facebook and Google are all scratching their heads to come up with solutions to ensure hardware reliability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>proteanTecs’ technology is determined to tackle the problem. “We provide visibility into the chips. Much like eyes and ears inside their electronics which help our customers monitor chip health and performance,” said Bonen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1652409367196.jpeg\" alt=\"Datacenter Predictive Maintenance\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>proteanTecs tech can be used to carry out predictive maintenance in data centers. / Photograph : proteantecs</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1652409367346.jpeg\" alt=\"proteanTecs 監測介面示意圖.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data monitoring dashboard allows proteanTecs customers access to insights and also predict when the chip is likely to experience an error. / Photograph : proteanTecs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With data monitoring, proteanTecs are able to provide insights and also predict when the chip was likely to experience an error, and preempt possible breakdown. So-called “agents” are embedded into semiconductor chips, extracting data back to the cloud-based SaaS platform. Insights generated will then be critical value to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “agent” bestows visibility upon any given product life cycle. In the initial stages of chip assembly and design, production visibility and variability analysis allows for faster time to market and improved quality. Further down the supply chain, such technology can be applied in-field such as EV chip monitoring, which provides alerts on faults before failures. EV-owners are guaranteed a much safer riding experience with proteanTecs’ technology.</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47684\">\r\n\r\n	<h2>Building Rome from day one</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>The business proteanTecs is involved in is far from an intuitive one, as the entry barrier for this is extremely high. “Our business consolidates a diverse array of talents, not a lot of companies can do that successfully,” said Bonen. Cross-discipline collaboration on proteanTecs’ team, including chip designers, software engineers and data scientists, is what contributes to proteanTecs success.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>proteanTecs has invented a unique approach, never seen before in the industry, building services holistically with data analysis and machine learning. Customers are thus able to see a red flag and understand impending failure in their devices. On the whole, proteanTecs solve problems that are not addressed today.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Currently, proteanTecs is expanding its presence around the globe. Specifically in the APAC region, where economic growth is robust. “Taiwan is the growth engine of APAC. We set up offices here in order to tap into the massive market,” said Bonen</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>proteanTecs landed in Taiwan in 2020, which couldn’t have been a harder year due to the raging pandemic. Vivian Chou, proteanTecs Regional Director of Greater China talked to us about the hardships she went through operating the single function in Taiwan, where she had to manage technical support and sales, secure region partnerships and establish distribution models.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>“We are like missionaries. As our solution is pretty new to the market, we had to work on government compliance issues and also seek out potential partners,” said Chou. Strong commitment and support was given by proteanTecs headquarters back in Israel, which shows the company’s commitment in this part of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Currently, proteanTecs has already partnered with industry juggernaut TSMC on the island. In the meanwhile, collaboration plans with automotive makers are underway, and strategic partnerships that integrate software solutions with the company’s technology are on the horizon.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Furthermore, Taiwan’s wealth of talents is also a big allure for the Israeli startup. “We are looking for application engineers and technical support personnel to join our ranks,” said Bonen.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47684\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47684</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-05-13 02:37:39', '2023-09-25 13:56:19', NULL),

In fact the US beer industry is 93+% white, and 76+% male. So the products that exist in the US are all the same — IPAs, light beers, lemon, lime, cherry flavored drinks. There weren’t any products made for overlooked minorities and communities like us, and Asian Americans are 6% of the US population and are the fastest growing minority group,” explains Kevin about the opportunity he saw in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard seltzer is a light alcoholic beverage — a blend of carbonated water, fruit flavoring and alcohol — that has gained global popularity over the last few years. “It’s a pretty crazy phenomenon because from 2018, in just a few years, this category went from nearly nothing to capturing a 10% share of the beer space and forecasts expect the market to grow to US$14 billion by 2027.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a second-generation Taiwanese American who has always been actively involved in the Asian American non-profit community, Kevin says thinking about his own identity and heritage has always been on his mind which led him to the idea of Lunar. But with no prior experience in the alcohol industry (both Sean and himself formerly worked in software startups), Kevin says they spent 18 months just learning how to make their product — hundreds of recipes later, they’ve finally landed on the delicious recipe that is now Lunar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1653632117792.jpeg\" alt=\"Lunar_Mainline - Cans Group\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first Asian American craft hard seltzer made with real fruits from Asia / Photograph : Lunar</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>An investment banker who didn’t want to look at a business simply through spreadsheets</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For someone who started his career in investment banking at J.P. Morgan, even Kevin himself didn’t expect he would leave the company so soon. “I left after a year because I knew I wanted to work at an early stage company,” says Kevin. He talks about how this tipping point came about when he was on a phone call with a CFO from a big company and while he was giving him the numbers and advising him about a transaction, he remembered sitting there thinking to himself: <strong>‘What do I actually know about running a company?’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“From my point of view as a young graduate back then, I really wanted to see for myself how a business is built and I didn’t want to just see it from excel spreadsheets because you may not be able to appreciate all the intricacies of running a business, so that’s when I knew I needed to go.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin went on to work at Yext, a marketing software company, and helped the company build its corporate strategy team and achieve a successful IPO. “I joined the company at a good time when it was still small, so I got to work on everything across the company and know how every team works. I find myself very fortunate in my career because that\'s everything I wanted to learn when I left J.P. Morgan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1653632117860.jpeg\" alt=\"Kevin Wong @ Lunar_brewing\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin brewing hard seltzer / Photograph : Lunar</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Starting a syndicate to invest in enterprise software startups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience he gained at Yext gave him the confidence and idea of starting an investment syndicate with his friends and former colleagues who are founders, operators and financial professionals that have experience building enterprise software companies from pre-revenue to post-IPO. “That’s how it led us to creating <a href=\"https://www.lorimerventures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lorimer Ventures</a> because we have the experience of literally doing everything at a typical software company — from building it up and expanding into international markets. So we wanted to bring that unique angle to the VC side.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin says Lorimer Ventures focuses on software startups from pre-seed to series A. “A few of our portfolio companies recently raised a Series A/B include <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220328005654/en/David-Energy-Secures-20.5-Million-Series-A-Financing-to-Scale-Its-Bundled-Offering\" target=\"_blank\">David Energy</a>, a software-enabled retail electricity provider, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/25/remote-work-boom-powers-firstbase-to-50m-series-b/\" target=\"_blank\">Firstbase</a>, a software service that helps companies track and manage their hardware assets that remote workers use.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By learning and developing all the key skills he needed on how to build up a business from the ground up, Kevin was ready to take on his next challenge — breaking into the craft beer industry with his own hard seltzer brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1653632160554.jpeg\" alt=\"Lunar made with Taiwanese passion fruit puree\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Made with Taiwanese passion fruit puree / Photograph : Lunar</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Celebrating his Asian American identity with the launch of Lunar</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Lunar special is that it is the first and only hard seltzer that’s made with real Asian fruits. “We feature flavors like yuzu, lychee, korean plum, and passion fruit — we’re hoping to pioneer a new chapter of alcoholic beverages via culture and storytelling. For example, we buy our yuzu juice directly from Japan’s Shimane prefecture. Our first batch of passion fruit used a passion fruit puree that was imported by our supplier from Taiwan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently only available in the US at many notable retailers such as Trader Joe’s Total Wine, Fairway, and Food Bazaar, Kevin says their goal with Lunar is to become a globally recognized brand known for their authentic products. “We’re aiming to become a community and we hope we’d get to sell our products across the world — including in Taiwan and in Asia. We\'d like to open up taproom experiences in different regions to serve as a gathering place for our community.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By bringing a product to the market that specifically addresses an overlooked community and by achieving commercial success, Kevin wants to prove and demonstrate that communities like ours is not a minority niche but a sizable market that the world should pay attention to serving. “For the Western world our flavors might be considered ‘exotic’ but to us are nostalgic and familiar, so by launching Lunar, it’s an opportunity for everyone to experience and appreciate our culture and heritage!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47696\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47696</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-05-27 06:16:41', '2023-09-25 13:55:33', NULL),

(483, 'How STARTBOARD achieves to bridge the talents between Southeast Asia and Taiwan: interview with the founder of STARTBOARD Uniform Lin', '2022-06-17', 'startup', '<p>Graduated from electro-optical engineering, Uniform Lin, however, wasn\'t a fan of becoming an engineer. He was perplexed about his future but also ambitious to somehow transform Taiwan. Luckily, Lin met professor Chun-Shan Chen, who was the Chair of Graduate Institute of Intellectual Property at Taipei Tech. At the time, Chen was planning to set up an association to assist Taiwanese manufacturers in becoming global brand enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea undoubtedly matched Lin\'s aim, so he decided to join the project. Chen said to him,“Let\'s change Taiwan bit by bit.” Thus, Global Brands Management Association (GBMA) was established in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking into what a company needs for transformation was a part of Lin\'s job, and he found that companies have to understand the local culture, industrial ecosystem, consumption habits, and sometimes the language of another country in order to go abroad. That is, someone who is familiar with the country, or even better, from the country, is a must for the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The potential of Southeast Asian students in Taiwan</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin then discovered the solution lies in a fact that has long been underestimated - there are a great number of Southeast Asian students in Taiwan. If these foreign talents are able to work at those Taiwanese companies during their stay, there\'d be a great opportunity for them to help the company to expand to their home countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, the project Global Young Leaders for Global Markets and CSR (GGC) was launched and executed by Lin at the end of 2014 to help foreign students, especially students from Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) and Indian, to find internships and jobs in Taiwan. It was successfully joined by more than 10 top universities, enterprises such as MediaTek and PwC, and hundreds of foreign students each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his years at GBMA, Lin has met people around the world and developed his own connections.“I followed professor Chen to visit a lot of big shots. I learned a lot and was grateful for having the chance to participate in those meetings,”said Lin. Yet, the professor encouraged Lin to leave GBMA to explore something different. Thus, Lin went to work at one of the largest and most respected law firms, Formosa Transnational, and became a graduate student of Graduate Institute of Intellectual Property at Taipei Tech in order to acquire further knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to hire foreigners in Taiwan ? &nbsp;?<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tRKBgt6kA5A\">https://youtu.be/tRKBgt6kA5A</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong></strong>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What push foreign talents to leave when they actually want to stay in Taiwan</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, an Indian friend of Lin\'s finished his Ph.D in computer science at National Chiao Tung University with a full scholarship for six years, and he wanted to start his own business in Taiwan. He came to Lin and asked for help as he was facing various obstacles to set up a company in Taiwan as a foreigner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, Lin didn\'t have enough experience and resources to solve his problem at the time.“The law regarding foreign entrepreneurs wasn\'t mature enough at the time,”explained Lin. Thus, even though his Indian friend wanted to stay and founded a company here, he still left.“Taiwan spent years cultivating a professional, however, we lost him in the end.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin noticed that his Indian friend wasn\'t the only case. In fact, a lot of Southeast Asian students have been facing the same situation. Therefore, in 2017, combined with the experience Lin has gained at GBMA and his background in law, STARTBOARD was born to help flourish Taiwan\'s talents pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>From an incubator to the professional of Southeast Asian-related business</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From industry mentors and partners, government resources, networking events to legal consulting and counseling, STARTBOARD is committed to providing a one-stop service for people from ASEAN and India that are interested in establishing companies in Taiwan. In addition, due to the approval of the National Development Council and Immigration agency, STARTBOARD is able to endorse foreign entrepreneurs for their visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Lin didn\'t forget his ideal and strength of assisting Taiwanese companies to go abroad as he did at GBMA. For example, many banks are planning to open branches in Southeast Asia, so they came to STARTBOARD in search of Southeast Asian graduates in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, since working at companies with the registered capital under five million doesn\'t meet the requirement of applying for the working visa, small-scale companies can contract to STARTBOARD to hire foreign students as employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, not only small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), STARTBOARD also provided service for one of the world\'s top 100 companies. By organizing an entrepreneur competition in India, STARTBOARD helped the enterprise to explore local talents as they planned to set up their own brand there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>STARTBOARD earn its endorsement from global representatives through trust</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the connections Lin has been building since working at GBMA and his sincere care for foriegn students and talents, he and his team showed the companies and even embassies from ASEAN and India that STARTBOARD is a trustworthy bridge for deeper partnership between the countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STARTBOARD was the only company invited when the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei held an event, and STARTBOARD has already set up their first oversea branch office in Thailand. In addition, the Representative of Indonesian Economic and Trade Office even attended STARTBOARD\'s networking event and offered assistance to Taiwanese manufacturers regarding exporting issues.“It is all built on trust,”said Lin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The close Southeast Asian community built by STARTBOARD makes itself the largest Southeast Asia startu', NULL, 1, '2022-06-17 10:24:43', '2022-06-17 10:32:32', NULL),

They anticipate that they could share what they have and what they experienced. Hence, they established WillStudy in 2019, committed to create a domestic study abroad ecosystem. It provides information integration before going abroad, resource matching in preparation, and assistance in arriving in the country you study abroad. WillStudy look forward to becoming a platform which can allow Taiwanese students to get more contact and information to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Experiences of Predecessors</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The official website of WillStudy contains different types of columns, including life of studying abroad, sharing of people with experience abroad, interviews with overseas career figures, and travel selections, the content of each article can bring great help to students planning to go abroad. In addition, WillStudy established one-on-one alumni consultation platform for studying abroad, which includes more than 280+ consultants, students can consult for different discipline clusters, degrees, and industries. With personal experience of specially assigned person, they can much deeply realize how to prepare and what to encounter when they study abroad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Talents Are Studying Abroad</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this era, the ways of apply for schools overseas have changed drastically. Instead of facing consultants in an agency, WillStudy has opened our eyes with the new method of online consulting and other self-help access to another dimension of studying abroad. STARTBOARD, also known as a company that helps companies expand their business overseas, is very glad to see more Taiwanese talents going abroad. STARTBOARD definitely has foreseen a bright future with the trend of studying abroad.</p>', NULL, 1, '2022-06-30 10:24:15', '2022-06-30 10:27:54', NULL),

And JaFun has proficiency and experience in making those modern technology happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Rise of Alternative Travel</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2022/6/10, Japan has opened their border. The country rated Taiwan as blue which refers to low risk of COVID and that Taiwanese tourists don’t need to go through PCR test nor quarantine. This news caught STARTBOARD’s attention and it is promising to see some progress in terms of international travel and shopping. Although the need for international flights has shrunken 48% in the past few years, STARTBOARD still see the potential in domestic traveling in Taiwan. Therefore, STARTBOARD is confident in supporting travel related startups despite the situation of this global pandemic.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-06-30 10:32:30', '2022-06-30 10:44:07', NULL),

However, their melting point is very low, resulting in the fat melting in the pans and a greasy plant-smelled piece of vegan meat. Other scientists have tried to use cultivated animal fat, yet it clearly does not fit strict vegan diets. Now, here comes the breakthrough of Lypid: the encapsulation technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Michelle Lee, cofounder and CTO of Lypid, is the expert of the encapsulation technique. She applied the technology with some special processing technology and formulation, which make liquid vegan oils to stand up to 165 degrees Celsius and contains more water components. With the fat still sticking onto the meat, the sense of creaminess, chewiness and juiciness is preserved. “If you look into animal fat, it’s not just lipid. It contains water, too. If you are always trying to imitate ‘fat’, the direction is wrong and it will never taste like ‘real fat.’” Jen-Yu explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1660723958609.jpeg\" alt=\"Lypid植物肉\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“If you look into animal fat, it’s not just lipid.

Vegan oils used today simply melt and leak out of the food matrices due to lower melting points,” said Dr. Michelle, “With our PhytoFat™, we are bringing the secret sauce back.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PhytoFat™ also provides a better nutritional profile, allowing a reduction of both calories and saturated fat compared to animal fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lypid scured USD$ 4 M seed fund early this year, and is ready for the mass production.

This is a long-standing challenge that the worldwide nutraceutical market thought was unsolvable. But a Taiwanese startup – boncha Bio – became the heroic problem-solver. Throughout a tough journey, it has successfully made supplements taste as delicious as soft sweets yet remain high-dose and high bioactivity.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In a post-pandemic world, staying healthy is at the forefront of many people’s minds. Yet, it is still difficult to make taking supplements a daily routine, as these little pieces either have some unpleasant odors or are simply like a hard pill to swallow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if someone could turn capsules, pills, and tablets into something tasty, easy-to-swallow as soft sweets? It is a seemingly impossible dream that Corina Huang – founder of boncha Bio – has made come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The nutrition industry tends to put all the emphasis on formulation,” the Taiwanese entrepreneur says, “but no matter how much nutrition a nutraceutical product contains, it is only effective when people are willing to take it on a regular basis.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing user-friendly supplements is not a brand new idea among nutraceutical companies. The real problem is, traditional confectionary dosage manufacturing techniques which require high temperatures and high pressure can kill off up to 85% of functional ingredients and lead to a significant drop in the bioactivity retention rate, hence affecting absorption rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1660725087419.jpeg\" alt=\"糖話生醫\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing a challenge that the entire global market thought was unsolvable, Corina started from scratch.

She founded a manufacturing technology platform – boncha Bio – aiming to develop candy-like supplements that are both potent and delicious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio’s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. “We call them [the products] ‘candyceuticals’ for a reason: We have overcome the low-dose and low-bioactivity limitation of user-friendly supplements,” wrote on boncha Bio’s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently partnered with many well-known nutritional brands and pharmaceutical enterprises, the Taiwanese firm attracts 4-5 new business clients every week. One of its clients is reported to have a 50% local market share in the nutraceutical of its market. Moreover, last year Corina won an international female entrepreneur award –<a href=\"https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/fellow/corina-huang\" target=\"_blank\">Cartier Women\'s Initiative Laureate</a> – in East Asia, standing out from over 800 candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, looking back, Corina describes herself as \"half an amateur\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The inspiration comes from witnessing her grandmother\'s pill-related difficulty swallowing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before stepping into the nutraceutical industry, Corina was the founder of a customized candy manufacturer that printed images, words, or patterns on sweets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of turning pills into candies actually came from Corina’s grandmother. About a decade ago, her grandmother suffered a stroke and required additional nutrients for her recovery. But due to pill-related difficulty swallowing, the capsules and tablets kept getting stuck in her throat. Corina still remembers how she had to break the pills into pieces for her granny, an act that highly affected the efficacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1660725087484.jpeg\" alt=\"網站產品頁-益生菌介紹-11.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio’s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. /Photograph : boncha Bio</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is, what Corina’s grandmother experienced is not uncommon.– She thought if her granny suffered this kind of difficulties, then there would be more people facing the similar situation in the world. Surprisingly, one out of two experiences difficulty swallowing pills and capsules. Its symptoms can actually happen to people of all ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To tackle the problem, Corina decided to start a new business. Since the type of candy Corina wanted to make is not hard and firm, but soft and juicy – which is considered even more user-friendly – the journey was full of hurdles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The research process: thousands of failures with no end in sight</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just to develop the candy shell, we have tested more than 400 recipes and parameters,” Corina says that the ultimate goal was to create sweets with an outer layer of soft coat and tasty liquid fillings. “Each day, our team could only test 1-2 recipes and wait for 1-3 more days to check if the shell can stay intact and no liquid would be leaking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, they managed to reach the goal. But another challenge arose when it came to probiotic supplements. “Live probiotics are extremely delicate,” Corina says. “They are afraid of light, water, and heat, cannot withstand pressure, and their life cycle is only 48 hours.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During each experiment, the research team would insert billions of probiotics into the sample and send it to a third-party testing unit. “Suppose we add 10 billion probiotics, then we’ll see how many are left after a week or even a year,” Corina says the process is prolonged because this way, they can ensure the high quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the goal seemed impossible to fulfill when experiments failed over and over again. “It\'s thousands of failures with no end in sight,” Corina says. It took them three years to finally reach the point where up to 10 billion live probiotics can be preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1660725087567.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_3633(S)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the goal seemed impossible to fulfill when experiments failed over and over again. “It\'s thousands of failures with no end in sight,” Corina says. / Photograph :Meet Global</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product soon became one of boncha Bio’s specialties. Not only did the researchers succeed in keep live probiotics gently dormant in the central filling, but they also managed to add “prebiotics” – plant fibers that can stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut – to the candy shell. In doing so, when people chew the candy, the prebiotics in the candy shell will naturally feed the probiotics, enhancing the survival rate of probiotic to colonize in the colon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Delicious supplements that business and individual customers both crave for</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By solving several long-standing problems in the market, boncha Bio’s reputation has gradually spread. Apart from the Asian market, nutraceutical businesses in western countries have also taken notice of this Taiwanese startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending its footprints in western markets, boncha Bio is well-prepared to face the fierce competition. When asked how to compete with peers, Corina says in a confident tone: “Just try one [candyceutical], and they [customers] will know the difference.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take fish oil as an example. Although it is widely accepted as an essential dietary supplement, its notorious fishy smell deters many. But boncha Bio managed to overcome the issue with a flavor-masking technique. The team once brought hundreds of samples to an exhibition in Switzerland. Without any pungent odor, the taste of their fish oil candies was so impressive that their samples ran out in a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boncha Bio’s “candies” are so popular that despite being a B2B company, even individual consumers become the brand’s big fans. “Some people will try to contact our sales team and ask us if they can buy supplements directly from us,” Corina says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, boncha Bio cooperated with Family Mart – a Japanese convenience store franchise chain – to provide two new products: the lutein for eye care and eight herbal extracts for throat care. Then the startup soon received messages from consumers saying that shelves in the stores were empty and they wanted to buy in bulk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cartier Women’s Initiative: a community where female entrepreneurs learn and grow together</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are not inventing something new,” Corina points out. “Instead, we are trying to integrate all the pre-existing resources and invest in the right topic.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, Corina was awarded as Cartier Women\'s Initiative Laureate in East Asia. It is an annual international entrepreneurship program open to women-run and women-owned businesses that bring sustainable social or environmental impacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1660725087636.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG_4301\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, Corina was awarded as Cartier Women\'s Initiative Laureate in East Asia. / Photograph : Meet Global</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an award-winning record, boncha Bio grabbed the media\'s attention. Around 10 news reports came out shortly afterward. Yet, in Corina’s opinion, the spotlight is not the most important. What she truly cherishes is the community she earned during the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As women leaders are still fewer than men in the startup market, “Cartier Women’s Initiative has created a global community where female entrepreneurs can learn and grow together,” Corina says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took her one year to pass the final stage of the assessment. But after the hard work paid off, she felt empowered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I think it [Cartier Women\'s Initiative] is the bridge between our team and the global market,” Corina says. “As my job is to make people get healthy with ease and peace of mind, I have started to realize how meaningful it is and how much responsibility I need to take.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming years, boncha Bio plans to continuously approach enterprise clients in Europe and America. By targeting sizable and international companies, Corina believes it is a way to make the greatest impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bigger the nutraceutical brand, the more end users can benefit from it. At last, Corina may be able to convince more people that taking dietary supplements isn\'t necessarily a mundane task; it can actually be an enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47769\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47769</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2022-08-17 08:33:09', '2023-09-25 13:52:30', NULL),

(521, 'This VC roots for revolutionary deep tech, will Taiwan be their next stop?', '2022-09-22', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Deep tech is bucking the trend of a “funding winter”. How can Taiwan businesses leverage the upticking deep tech developements amid this investment gloom?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>One area of investment is bucking the “funding winter” downturn as warned by Sequoia Capital. Deep tech (or hard tech) has gained attention from investors due to its slow but steady growth amid a flurry of investment snowstorms that caused slumps in market valuation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Deep tech is the fundamental science that charts the path for new applications across multiple industries. Consider it a kind of ‘platform technology’, if you will,” said Dr. Michelle Kiang, co-founder of Impact Science Ventures (ISV).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. The three founders of ISV, Michelle Kiang, Alain Harrus and Robert Ethier, combine their academic strengths, industry experience and investment expertise to scale deep tech startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1664957050368.jpeg\" alt=\"ISV founders\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. /Photograph : ISV</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a VC operator based in the US, Kiang’s ties with Taiwan may provide oppotunities for bilateral cooperation. Kiang is born-and-raised in Taiwan, she then went on to study Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, an academia that incubated many prominent figures including Barry Lam, founder of Quanta Computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quantum physicist who got her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, Kiang got her start in entrepreneurship shortly after grad school to commercialize her invention as part of her thesis and spent her early career building semiconductor and communications products as co-founder and CEO/CMO at a number of successful startups. She also held executive roles in strategy and corporate development at TDK, Micron Technology and NeoPhotonics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there’s a longer return horizon for deep tech investments, it’s a niche for some investors— it’s an advantage only those with considerable industry experience and investment acumen can leverage. Once successfully commercialized, deep tech startups possess the revolutionary power to change the world. From silicon chips, artificial intelligence to solar tech, all of which are deep tech that has changed our way of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1664957079118.jpeg\" alt=\"chirp_7236\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial Chirp team while they were at the UC Berkeley Skydeck Accerlerator Program. Kiang is a serial entrepreneur. Chirp Microsystems is one of her many co-founded startups, which was later acquired by TDK, the world\'s leading electronic component company. /Photograph : Michelle</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Deep tech, not for the faint of heart</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiang talked about how they came to focus on deep tech investment. “We believe major problems around the world will be solved by deep tech,” said Kiang firmly. That is, deep tech could have positive economic as well as social impact on the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cohort companies of ISV include startups like <a href=\"https://www.umarofoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">UMARO</a> which looks to redefine plant-based food, <a href=\"https://antoraenergy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Antora Energy</a> that decarbonized heavy industry with renewable heat, and <a href=\"https://www.liminalinsights.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Liminal</a> that seeks to help EV makers avoid costly battery recalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1664957120425.jpeg\" alt=\"ISV-Energy\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. /Photograph : ISV Official Website</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the applications of deep tech is extremely extensive. Take the example of Antora Energy. Having successfully scaled, its decarbonizing thermal management solutions could be applied to heavy industries like cement, steel or petrochemicals, contributing to a greener Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep tech and hard tech investment is far from a walk in a park. In the process of deep tech commercialization, scaling up is one hard job to get done. A much longer time frame is needed for deep tech to be commercialized, and a wide array of skill sets must be deployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“From one to one million. That is the tricky part,” said Kiang. Hard tech isn’t like software innovation or consumer products, where you could easily release copies of products or services. Hard tech innovation requires deeper due diligence tasks, heavier capital investment, and more time to grow into large assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ISV brought in advisors to make use of their field expertise, ensuring high-quality due diligence. Not only do the group of advisors provide key insights to the VC side, but they also give valuable recommendations to the startups in question to help them accelerate growth and achieve market success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We consider ourselves somewhat of an incubator program,” said Kiang. Being much more than a VC, ISV has now grown an outstanding portfolio that exerts a positive impact on the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as deep tech investment goes, there are three critical elements that make for a great one. The keys are “differentiable tech, hands-on industry experience and a good team,” according to Kiang. Take Antora Energy, a portfolio company of ISV, to illustrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antora aims to stop climate change through affordable thermal energy storage system. Its tech is differentiable with other solar tech for its on-demand supply and affordability. As one Antora founder calls it, their tech is “hot as hell and dirt cheap”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the team behind Antora possess diverse experience which complements each other wonderfully. While two co-founders are fresh phD graduates, the other one is a startup veteran having founded a solar-tech startup prior to this experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Will Taiwan be the next stop?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Amid geopolitical tensions, Taiwan not only made its name to political headlines but also business front pages. What was mostly known to people outside Taiwan about the island is mainly its state-of-the-art semiconductor technology. But Taiwan has more to offer in terms of global business partnerships than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1664957148208.jpeg\" alt=\"Taipei 101\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a VC operator based in the US, Kiang’s ties with Taiwan may provide oppotunities for bilateral cooperation. / Photograph : Unsplash</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"47791\">\r\n\r\n	<p>Kiang shared some key insights on U.S.-Taiwan partnerships. It’s an unprecendented advantage for Taiwan amid geopolitical tensions, however, foreign VC funding still has not gained a full picture of Taiwan’s industry landscape and the opportunites it has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In the near future, Kiang looks forward to connect U.S. startups with Taiwanese businesses, and vice versa. Channels of investment also include government-funded VC projects. Prior to joining ISV, Kiang was a venture partner at Industrial Technology Investment Corporation (ITIC), a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>For those startups who seek funding from U.S.-based VCs, Kiang has pitched in some advice. First of all, it bodes well with VCs when startups aims at addressing global issues as opposed to local problems that will be hard to see extensive application. Furthermore, if a Taiwanese startup has already built connections with the U.S. market (i.e. established client ties), VCs will be more convinced to channel their funding energy into them.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>To Kiang’s belief, Taiwan will be a major role in deep tech development. “I’m not saying that just because I’m Taiwanese,” said Kiang. It is her extensive expertise in the field that gave her the instinct to sniff out great opportunities in the world and for the world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div data-sid=\"Meet_D_Article_bottom_video\">〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47791\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47791</a></div>', NULL, 1, '2022-10-05 08:06:35', '2023-09-25 13:48:55', NULL),

At the same time, they work with mid-to-large enterprises through CSE to introduce startups products and services (52.9%), to utilize startups tools and methodologies and promote internal culture transformation (47.9%), and further to proceed with conceptual validation (46.2%). For example, Asia Pacific Telecom, a mid-to-large enterprise, cooperates with MAKAR REALITY to apply 5G technology to Songyan Cultural and Creative Park. Startups have lived up to expectations through their visionary technologies and products, integrity, and mature business models. As a result, the number of CSE cases is increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look closely in existing mid-to-large enterprises CSE scale, the focus is on startup transformation acceleration: AI (52.9%), intellectual production (28.6%), information security (26.1%), fintech (24.4%), and IoT networks (24.4%). Even CSE late comers express their interests in information security (48.1%), intellectual production (47.0%), AI (44.3%), IoT networks (26.8%), e-commerce/new retail (24.6%).

They were recently invited to give a speech at COP27 in Egpyt, which amaze the globe by showing alternative fat made by their leading-edge alternative protein technology, PhytoFat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The listeners were so surprised by how our alternative fat can be applied to not only meat but also dessert,” says Dr. Jen-Yu Huang, Co-founder and CEO of Lypid, as he recalls the reaction of the audience while he explained Lypid’s “versatile vegan fat” at one of the COP27’s events hosted by Green Generation Fund &amp; Global Alliance for a Sustainable Planet. “Unlike spreading weasel words or discussing the new technology and what can we do in the future, we were talking about what we had already done.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lypid’s partnership with Louisa Coffee is a vivid example of their ambition to shift non-vegetarians’ diet habits. Huang highlights Lypid’s aim is to make plant-based meat more delicious which will attract more people to make the vegan choice spontaneously, and reduce the number of people who consume meat that produces a large amount of greenhouse-gas emissions. “That is how Lypid’s vegan fat helps global development in solving the climate issue,” explains Huang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the advantage of Taiwan to dedicate to the ESG field, Huang underscores Taiwan is a role model for the alternative food industry due to its long-developed vegan market and huge vegetarian population which also surprised many audiences at COP27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the relevance between the food industry and the environment is not always the first thing that people would think of while discussing how to solve climate issues. “The concept of food sustainability has a massive impact on the environment and is quite fresh for most people, especially for the attendants at COP27 are mostly from the official or people who are not in the food industry”. Huang hopes to disseminate this concept to more people, even the government unit who are making the decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than that, “It was hard to find plant-based food options that served at the event.” says Dr. Michelle Lee, co-founder and CTO of Lypid, who discovered a situation during the COP27. “Many entrepreneurs who present at the day were struggling to find food to eat because they are vegans.” Michelle hopes to see more alternative food served at the COP28, “It would also let the people realise how the technology has developed so far and bring a refreshing perspective to people about the taste of vegan food,” suggests Michelle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2022-03%2Fimg-1646734555-43272.jpg&amp;w=900&amp;maxage=90d\" alt=\"Lypid完成種子輪 400 萬美元募資\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lypid cofounders Jen-yu Huang and Michelle Lee. / Photograph : Lypid</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From Taiwan to the globe! Space Bao’s vegan pan-fried bun will be at Costco</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the collaboration with Louisa Coffee, Space Bao, a Taiwanese restaurant selling vegan pan-fried bun made a strategic partnership with Lypid. One of their latest products is a traditional pepper-flavoured pan-fried bun which features Lypid’s PhytoFat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeffrey Liu, the founder of Space Bao and other two famous and award-winning vegan restaurants shares a common goal with Lypid of “making vegan food more delicious”. He also promotes the ideas of “flexitarian” and “meat-free days twice a week”, “these are more acceptable and painless for people who are not vegetarian but want to change their eating habits,” says Jeffrey. It encourages more people to try vegan food without entirely giving up meat but contributes to sustainability, simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of his restaurants, Little Tree Food was granted a double Michelin award in 2022. One is the Michelin Green Star which recognises their distinguished contribution to environmental sustainability; The Bib Gourmand award acknowledged Little Tree Food is an affordable Michelin restaurant where customers only need to spend under NTD 1000 to enjoy 3 dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disrupting the dominant vegan product, burger steak by featuring Asian preference for meat, Jeffrey choose to develop vegan ground meat and created the delicious vegan pan-fried bun. With the aim of making their juicy vegan pan-fried bun available outside of Taiwan, he made a proposal in order to sell the pan-fried bun at Costco which is the fifth largest retailer in the world and promote Taiwan’s advanced technology in the food industry at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the plant-based food industry, mangrove forests often come to people’s minds as one of the solutions to the climate crisis. However, urban development, agriculture and aquaculture have been observed to be the major causes of mangrove deforestation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Leverage AIoT with the aim to solve deforestation this startup can reduce 100 million tons of CO2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2021-12%2Fimg-1640767528-43339.jpg&amp;w=900&amp;maxage=90d\" alt=\"艾滴科技_創業午餐會\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ID Water is a leading aquaculture startup that aims at achieving digital agriculture and digital farming to solve climate change with its AIoT solution. / Photograph : 侯俊偉攝影</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ID Water is a leading aquaculture startup that aims at achieving digital agriculture and digital farming to solve climate change with its AIoT solution. They developed a farming model which integrates the water quality monitoring system, AI data analysis and IoT automation technology, in an effort to reduce carbon footprint, labor cost, increase the unit yield and achieve a sustainable future for aquaculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conforming to the government’s green power policy, ID Water not only provides one-stop farming services to maintain fishery farming but also creates “shrimp and electricity symbiosis farms” through the partnership with energy suppliers in 2022. This helps shrimp farmers increase their productions more effectively and decreases the carbon footprint of traditional farming which cause serious mangrove deforestation. Shrimp farming is quite susceptible to the environment, in particular, drastic changes in climate and water quality are likely to cause shrimp-induced diseases which would pollute the whole farm. This highlight the need for the water quality monitoring system that ID Water has offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up to 70% of the carbon emission of agriculture comes from deforestation, which underlines the importance of maintaining the forest. However, “to do the shrimp farming needs to deforest the mangrove constantly, it is definitely not sustainable,” states Alan Yu, the founder of ID Water. Not to mention the fact that the mangrove tree possesses higher carbon fixation capacity than the terrestrial trees. “We are planning to build 100,000 hectares of the breeding ponds in 10-year which could reduce 100 million tons of carbon dioxide,” anticipates Alan, as he points out ID Water’s mission, is to solve the pressing problem of mangrove deforestation from the traditional aquaculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ambition for the sustainability of aquaculture and bringing their product to the globe, ID Water’s next step is Vietnam, the second-largest shrimp export country in the world. They are planning to make strategic cooperation with a shrimp processing factory that provides shrimp-made products to Haidilao Hot Pot. This famous Chinese hot pot restaurant chain occupies around 1400 branches worldwide.</p>\r\n<div data-sid=\"Meet_D_Article_bottom_video\">〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47855\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47855</a></div>', NULL, 1, '2023-01-09 06:13:35', '2023-01-16 09:20:03', NULL);

Integrating the government’s resources, the hub will enhance the US and Taiwan collaboration across startups, scientific research, academia, and talent cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2023-01%2Fimg-1673490478-51882.jpeg&amp;w=1200&amp;maxage=90d\" alt=\"Stanford\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan Science and Technology Hub will set up at Stanford University. / Photograph : Wiki media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NSTC established the Taiwan Science and Technology Hub at Stanford University to integrate a wide breadth of resources, which span from scientific research, academia, start-ups, and talent cultivation, into a single platform that will be crucial in promoting cooperation between Taiwan and the US. Through cross-ministry cooperation, the Hub will also hold a series of academic and scientific research conferences, symposiums, and workshops at Stanford University and the surrounding areas in the near future to enhance Taiwan’s international profile and impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“You can imagine that the hub will foster more bilateral collaboration. Not just tech professionals and scientists who want to come to the US can leverage the hub, foreigners who are interested in Taiwan also can leverage the hub, ” said Chang.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>long term partnership with the US and Taiwan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The NSTC has been committed to promoting bilateral scientific research cooperation, talent cultivation, and talent exchanges between Taiwan and the US. For example, the NSTC awards grants to Taiwanese researchers to study in a variety of different fields at Stanford University through several talent cultivation programs such as the SPARK Program, the Stanford-Taiwan Biomedical Fellowship Program (STB), and the Stanford-Taiwan Social Science Fellowship Program (STSS). In addition, the NSTC provides academic research experience to doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows through the Graduate Students/Postdoctoral Study Abroad Program and the Dragon Gate Program to Stanford University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2023-01%2Fimg-1673490568-41667.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;maxage=90d\" alt=\"Science and Technology hub\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NSTC will coordinates cross-ministry and cross-discipline programs and allocates relevant resources. / Photograph : NSTC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NSTC also coordinates cross-ministry and cross-discipline programs and allocates relevant resources. For this reason, the NSTC has integrated existing programs into the Taiwan S&amp;T Hub, and the hub will support talent cultivation, conducts international exchanges. This platform will allow relevant programs to connect abroad, enhance cross-discipline academic capacities, and demonstrate the impact of Taiwan\'s tech power internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Top scientists from the US onboard to help the Hub</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the press conference, the co-chair of the Hub Ying-Chih Chang introduced the main functions and goals of it. Subsequently, Faculty Executive Board Member Professor Philip Wong shared his views on new opportunities for Taiwan-US semiconductor cooperation. Finally, Scientific Advisor and UC Berkeley School of Public Health Dean Michael Lu discussed deepening cooperation between Taiwan and the US in public health during the post-pandemic era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key members of the Hub, who have extensive experience in cross-discipline coordination, possess forward-looking insight into the future of the cooperation between Taiwan and the US in critical fields such as scientific research, semiconductors, and innovation. These members will help link up Taiwanese researchers with important scientific institutions throughout the Bay Area such as Stanford University and UC Berkeley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Minister Tsung-Tsong Wu’s remarks, he stated that the Taiwan Science and Technology Hub is an innovative approach to address a larger set of challenges posed by international competition during the post-pandemic era. Wu said that Taiwan needs to make use of its strengths in techonology to create greater synergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wu mentions that the Hub will serve as an important platform for higher education, scientific research, and industry-academia cooperation. In the future, the Hub will enhance Taiwan’s image as an important player in international research by providing opportunities for Taiwan’s scientific community and technological capacities to forge stronger connections with important institutions in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47864\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47864</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-01-18 02:36:04', '2023-01-18 02:36:04', NULL),

We believe the continuous growth of Blocto users in the current environment is indicative of portto’s commitment to be one of the most influential blockchain companies in the industry,” said Tony Wang, managing partner of silicon valley VC firm 500 Global.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining Cuban and 500 Global is the global character brand IPX (formerly Line Friends). Other previous Blocto investors and advisors include Kevin Chou of Gen. G Esport; Roham Garegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs; blockchain gaming giant Animoca Brands; among other notable names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blocto\'s multichain wallet aims to make blockchain technology more accessible. Already natively supporting the Ethereum, Aptos, Solana, Flow, BNB Chain, Polygon and Tron networks, Blocto intends to expand into promising new blockchain ecosystems in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>democratize access to the blockchain</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“User experience is at the core of portto’s product development. People often shy away from dApps, as they are difficult to understand due to the intricate blockchain technology. “Intuitive design allows users to access dApp service without having to understand the blockchain technology,” said Hsuan Lee in a previous interview with Meet Global.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1678687629455.jpeg\" alt=\"Blocto創辦人 李玄\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Blocto\'s mission is to democratize access to the opportunities blockchain tech presents by creating simple-yet-powerful products that provide the same great UX across multiple blockchain ecosystems, said Lee. /Photograph : 蔡仁譯攝影</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Blocto\'s mission is to democratize access to the opportunities blockchain tech presents by creating simple-yet-powerful products that provide the same great UX across multiple blockchain ecosystems. We\'re thrilled to have attracted funding from investors that share our vision. With their support, we\'re better equipped than ever to onboard the next billion users to crypto,\" said Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing a user-friendly entry point to the world of DeFi, NFTs, GameFi and Web3, Blocto removes typical friction points encountered by industry newcomers. The application has simplified the often-confusing cryptographic key system that is fundamental to transacting with cryptocurrency and designed a more intuitive, chain-agnostic gas fee system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Blocto\'s SDK, the Web3 ecosystem strengthens its cross-platform expansion, boosting user acquisition. A 95% conversion rate (20x the industry standard), a less-than-30-second email login process, and a freemium model that simplifies gas fees and transactions all make integrating with Blocto an easy win for developers and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the lull in the crypto markets, portto remains profitable and user metrics continue to surge. As of November 2022, Blocto has amassed 1.6 million users, and BloctoBay is the most popular non-custodial NFT marketplace on the Flow blockchain. After its recent expansion into the Aptos ecosystem — as part of its chain-agnostic efforts to drive mass adoption across multiple networks — Blocto has quickly established itself as the second largest Aptos wallet with more than 400,000 users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Blockchain is an attractive emerging market that, similar to the internet back in the \'90s, is here to stay. Although we can see the full potential of blockchain technology, the main key to mass adoption is an easy user onboarding experience — something that Blocto provides. This is also why big consumer-facing companies such as Yahoo, MotoGP Ignition, and Gogoro all choose Blocto as their exclusive partner to explore the Web3 world,\" said Edwin Yen, co-founder and COO of Blocto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47885\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47885</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-03-13 06:09:44', '2023-09-26 04:33:40', NULL),

Compared to other countries, Taiwanese teams have the similar design style with Japan, which means relatively low difficulty in entering the Japanese market,” said Takahashi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAIWAN TSUTAYA General Manager Ryunosuke Hashimoto emphasize that TSUTAYA BOOKSTORE already partnered with several Taiwanese brands and is experienced on bring Taiwanese brands to the Japanese market. TSUTAYA can act as an agent for Taiwanese company during the crowdfunding campaign and Taiwanese company do need to establish a Japanese subsidiary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Takahashi also mentioned that it is also imporatant to obtain certified security certificates, professional institution certifications, or ensure that the product complies with regulatory standards before launching a crowdfunding campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Strengthen the tie with Taiwanese market</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, GREEN FUNDING conduct a series of campaign to strengthen the tie with Taiwanese market.

According to the founder and CEO of PackAge+ Ye De Wei, the goal of this funding round is to accelerate the company\'s circular packaging scale, expand diversified services to create diversified revenue, and expand internationally.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A large number of return stations have become the cornerstone of PackAge+\'s future plans. Ye De Wei said that this fundraising is to allow PackAge+ to develop diversified business models and focus on the development of more circular service application scenarios, such as sharing return stations with circular cups, circular lunch boxes, and other circular startups, to expand the energy of shared circular services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye De Wei also revealed that PackAge+ is collecting various data points from the circular system to build an AI model that calculates the best recycling route, which means the least carbon footprint. They have also collaborated with a well-known food delivery platform. In the future, restaurant operators will use PackAge+ circular packaging instead of plastic bags for food packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1681800427881.jpeg\" alt=\"葉德偉_配客嘉執行長_2021_11_08_蔡仁譯攝-2.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ye De Wei also revealed that PackAge+ is collecting various data points from the circular system to build an AI model that calculates the best recycling route. /Photograph : 蔡仁譯攝</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The investors of this funding round include CTBC Venture Capital, Chang Hua Commercial Bank Venture Capital, National Development Fund, Arbor Impact Investment, SIC Sustainable Impact Capital, Shell Amplify, and other strategic investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Administration, Taiwan\'s e-commerce industry uses more than 220 million disposable packages annually, equivalent to producing over 50,000 tons of garbage and causing serious environmental impacts. In order to reduce packaging waste from the source, the \"E-commerce Packaging Reduction Regulations\" will be implemented on July 1, 2023. The regulations set targets for the use of circular packaging for businesses with capital over NT$150 million. By 2026, the circular packaging utilization rate should reach 15%, including the four major e-commerce companies MOMO, Eastern Home Shopping &amp; Leisure, PChome, and Shopee, as well as B2C businesses such as food, cosmetics, 3C products, and clothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PackAge+’s “circulating packaging” product can be reused at least 50 times and effectively reduce the waste of disposable packaging when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can reduce around 1.2kg of carbon emissions using PackAge+’s packaging every time. However, besides the durable eco-friendly packaging, the key to the service is how to establish a perfect circular system from shipping, returning, to recycling and cleaning of the packaging bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1681800458122.jpeg\" alt=\"PackAge+ 配客嘉\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PackAge+’s “circulating packaging” product can be reused at least 50 times and effectively reduce the waste of disposable packaging when shopping on e-commerce platforms. / Photograph : 配客嘉 提供</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PackAge+ has connected e-commerce platforms, return merchants, and consumers, using the cooperation of e-commerce platforms or return merchants\' coupons as a reward for consumers to return packaging. At the same time, it has connected e-commerce platforms and chain stores such as Shopee, Family Mart, and Carrefour. So far, there are 4,500 return stations and 650,000 circular packages in circulation, which is equivalent to reducing about 195,000 kilograms of disposable e-commerce packaging waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Collaborating with the semiconductor industry</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its development in the circular economy and e-commerce fields, PackAge+ has also expanded into the technology industry. In 2023, PackAge+ collaborated with a well-known semiconductor wafer factory to develop \"Eco-Circular Boxes\" made from the factory\'s waste plastic, which will be used for logistics and transportation by their partner suppliers to create a more environmentally friendly supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through this initiative, PackAge+ CEO Ye De Wei expressed his hope to collaborate with more technology manufacturers in the future. Besides using the waste plastic to create circular boxes for internal use, they will also provide these boxes to e-commerce platforms that sell relevant products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if a laptop brand sells well on a platform, then the laptop brand can produce its own circular box and provide it to customers through the platform, and it can reduce the brand\'s carbon emissions in the Scope 3 category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Lin, co-founder of SIC Sustainable Impact Investing, commented, \"Most companies today only focus on reducing greenhouse emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, but in reality, 80-95% of their emissions fall under Scope 3. We are optimistic about PackAge+’s multi-dimensional approach to help companies reduce their Scope 3 emissions, including using circular packaging for corporate gifts, circular box transportation in the supply chain, and other emerging services to become a driving force for companies to significantly reduce their emissions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partner of Chang Hua Commercial Bank Venture Capital, also mentioned that PackAge+ can outsource the cleaning work in their circular packaging system to social welfare units, creating more job opportunities for vulnerable groups and promoting sustainable and inclusive employment and social innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47902\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47902</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-04-18 06:50:56', '2023-09-25 13:40:00', NULL),
(559, 'Boosting recruitment and retention of international talent', '2023-05-02', '', '<p>Taiwan in recent years has been facing rising competition for foreign talent along with a brain drain of domestic professionals. To fill the talent and technology gap for industries, the government enacted the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals in February 2018, along with amendments to the act in October 2021, to further ease work and residency regulations and improve tax and social security benefits for overseas professionals who wish to work in Taiwan. Furthermore, the government set up a policy consultation platform in July 2021 to strengthen Taiwan\'s ability to recruit and retain the international talent required for the nation\'s \"five plus two\" innovative industries and the Six Core Strategic Industries. In January 2023, the Executive Yuan also approved draft amendments to the Immigration Act that would increase incentives for high-quality talent to come and stay in Taiwan, thus creating a friendlier and more effective environment for talent recruitment and retention.\r\n	<br>\r\n	<br><strong>Key actions</strong>\r\n	<br>■ <strong>Relaxing work and visa requirements:</strong> The government is issuing Employment Gold Cards (a four-in-one work permit, resident visa, alien resident certificate and reentry permit) and employment-seeking visas; graduates from the world\'s top universities are exempt from the work requirement of two years\' previous work experience; foreign professionals are exempt from applying for work permits once they have gained permanent residency; and the maximum duration of a work permit for a foreign special professional has been increased to five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>■ <strong>Relaxing residency requirements:</strong> Foreign professionals, foreign special professionals, and foreign or overseas compatriot students may apply directly for a residency permit if they enter Taiwan visa-free or on a visitor visa, thus simplifying application procedures for working or studying in Taiwan. For foreign professionals applying for permanent residency, their required presence in Taiwan has been changed from a minimum of 183 days per year to an average of 183 days per year. For foreign special professionals applying for permanent residency, their required period of presence has been shortened from five years to three years. For foreigners who have obtained permanent residency, their required presence in Taiwan has been changed from a minimum of 183 days per year to an average of 183 days per year over the last five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>■ <strong>Improving tax incentives and social protections:&nbsp;</strong>Foreign special professionals coming to Taiwan for the first time will receive special tax exemptions for their first five years of employment, up from three years previously, and can qualify for expanded coverage under the national pension and national health insurance systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>■ <strong>Relaxing entry and residence restrictions for nationals without household registration:&nbsp;</strong>The required period of presence in Taiwan for nationals without household registration applying for permanent residency has been shortened to five years. The required presence for permanent residents applying for household registration has been shortened from one continuous year to 335 days within one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>■ <strong>Coordinating intragovernmental measures to recruit and retain talent:&nbsp;</strong>Policy strategies for international talent will focus on employment in the \"five plus two\" innovative industries, Six Core Strategic Industries and key service industries; strengthen recruitment and retention of personnel such as those demanded by large-scale investment companies, or graduates from the 500 top-ranked universities worldwide; and resolve various issues that professionals face when moving to Taiwan, thus building a better life for foreigners on the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information:\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=A0030295\">Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals</a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://law.moea.gov.tw/EngLawContent.aspx?lan=E&amp;id=10449\">Foreign Special Professionals with Specialized Knowledge/Skills in Economic Fields</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original : Executive Yuan 〕\r\n	<a href=\"https://english.ey.gov.tw/News3/9E5540D592A5FECD/440b0844-c16b-4d7f-98c6-f112cf0d493f\"></a>\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://english.ey.gov.tw/News3/9E5540D592A5FECD/440b0844-c16b-4d7f-98c6-f112cf0d493f\">https://english.ey.gov.tw/News3/9E5540D592A5FECD/440b0844-c16b-4d7f-98c6-f112cf0d493f</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-05-02 09:15:34', '2023-05-02 09:18:30', NULL),

(563, 'The Intelligent Future of Food', '2023-05-11', '', '<p><strong><em>A handful of Taiwanese entrepreneurs are paving the way forward through a combination of technology and innovation, changing the game for everything from production to delivery.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s a buzz of activity inside Taipei Tech Arena, a sports facility partially repurposed into a startup hub, providing first-class office amenities like well-proportioned conference rooms and presentation areas, desks, co-working spaces, and the IT infrastructure needed to launch entrepreneurial dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside sits Foodland Ventures, a Taiwan-based Agritech venture capital firm and accelerator dedicated to F&amp;B innovations and farm-to-table solutions. The company believes opportunities in this sector are often overlooked by bigger venture capital funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taiwan is very strong in technology as well as agriculture,” says Foodland Ventures CEO Victor Chen. “We hope to marry these two skills and bring this to other markets. Taiwan has so many tech talents and a robust farm-to-table system, with many good entrepreneurs who can propose solutions to current problems.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One lesson learned by the F&amp;B industry during the pandemic is that restaurants need to be more than physical locations. Most restaurants extended their business well beyond the walls of their dining rooms through delivery service and take-out. In fact, 65% of Taiwan’s restaurants still offer food delivery. Many successful eateries have also developed a “brand,” easily identifiable on the internet and attracting online orders that bolster revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chen posits that a strong brand creates the opportunity for expansion abroad, pointing to the popularity of new Taiwanese franchises in the U.S., such as 85°C Bakery Cafe, Din Tai Fung, and numerous bubble tea shops. These companies perfected their business model in Taiwan before going overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Taiwan is good at standardizing practices and making food accessible through low prices or what is referred to as CP (cost-performance) value,” says Chen. “Taiwan is also a small geographic area, leading to innovation and quick adaptation to market trends.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, many of the abovementioned businesses are also implementing new technology. For instance, Din Tai Fung uses a QR code to direct patrons to an ordering platform with assistance provided by waitstaff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This form of digital ordering offers better sanitation, as you aren’t touching a common menu anymore,” says Chen. “It’s also better than a shared menu tablet, which needs to be cleaned after each use.” He adds that such orders can be linked to a delivery robot, which can also lead to reduced staffing costs. “Restaurants spend a lot of money when it comes to training new personnel,” he says, stressing the significant time required to teach cash register systems, order delivery processes, and other tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eliminating such training through online menus and digital payment can lead to big savings. In fact, one Foodland-invested company, DotDot Global, provides an online ordering system where participating restaurants are given printer boxes that print new order tickets. The system even collects payments, eliminating many front-of-house functions and allowing local business owners to compete directly with Uber Eats and Foodpanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Foodland investee, Kabob, offers platform-level management of digital menus, online ordering, and inventory and account management. With just a few simple clicks, menus, signage, and displays can be updated to reflect new prices or add new menu items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“To change the menu in a store or throughout the entire network takes less training and manpower now,” says Chen. “It is all interconnected digital signage and digital ordering. We want to offer SaaS [Software as a Service] solutions that are modularized and interconnected, and all based upon software and computer technology.”</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1684228000178.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF14-1.jpg 800w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF14-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF14-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\">\r\n	<figcaption><strong><em>Space Bao uses plant-based meat substitutes to break stereotypes of traditional and vegetarian food.</em></strong></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovations at the source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many food businesses benefit from innovations, they also face challenges from the impact of climate change. Drought-like conditions have already displaced rice planting in central and southern Taiwan this year, and other agricultural industries may also be affected as climate change exacerbates extreme weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan’s aquaculture industry is now suffering from seasonality, or differing temperate conditions, which can affect the growth of fish, shrimp, and mollusks. Chen says neighboring Southeast Asia is faring better, as it’s not only more competitive in terms of weather but also labor costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foodland’s biggest investment success is ID Water, which uses IOP sensors to test water quality for shrimp breeding pools. The company implements IoT solutions such as underwater cameras, sensors, and other equipment for real-time monitoring to solve water quality problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After developing a simple and cost-effective solution to maintain ideal shrimp breeding conditions, ID Water was able to export its technology to Thailand. The technology also helps cut down on pesticides and chemicals once needed to keep shrimp ponds clean and free of dreaded parasites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As many countries move toward intensive agricultural practices due to limited land availability, more parasites and disease will inevitably affect crops and livestock. This problem is especially prevalent in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have lots of biodiversity because of our year-round temperate climate, but this also leads to a lot of pests,” says Chen. “There are many pests that need to be controlled throughout the year. Many entrepreneurs are trying to pinpoint how to combat these pests in an economical way.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many are turning to technology and automation to help battle the problem. Technological solutions also help alleviate shortages caused by skyrocketing labor costs and a decreased interest in physically demanding agricultural work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“One entrepreneur notified us that there is now a shortage of drone pilots,” notes Chen. “They are highly in demand in the agriculture sector, which is now using drones to apply pesticides. Traditional applications – a person spraying a field, for example – wastes 70-80% of pesticides as they are blown away by the wind. “With drones, downward wind caused by propellers allows for a more efficient application of pesticides.”</p>\r\n<figure><img src=\"/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1684228027610.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF1-1.jpg 800w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF1-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\">\r\n	<figcaption><em><strong>Lypid showcased its latest innovation, the world’s first plant-based “pork belly” at the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show, held January in Las Vegas.</strong></em></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New, flavorful experiences</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across from Yongkang Park in central Taipei sits a sleek, futuristic restaurant with a new take on dining. At Space Bao, the ingredients are just as futuristic as the ordering and payment methods, which are done on a large touchscreen monitor at the front of the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Space Bao has already won over many netizens eager to gain a glimpse of future dining experiences. The restaurant serves vegetarian food with a modern twist on traditional pan-fried buns. Space Bao’s buns are made from a meat alternative infused with PhytoFat, a source of plant-derived fat, and available in innovative new flavors, including corn soup and Szechuan pepper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternative protein is a growing segment that’s gained considerable hype for being healthier and having a smaller impact on the environment. One company that’s gained from the increased interest is Lypid, a Taiwanese startup focused on driving innovation in the food industry and the creator of PhytoFat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a self-proclaimed “foodie, food addict, and avid cook,” Lypid co-founder Michelle Lee is passionate about making a difference through her work in food innovation. Her goal is to have a positive impact on the world by creating new and exciting food products that push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee has dedicated much of her life to food science, first joining National Taiwan University’s Food Science Department before attending Ohio State University and then earning a Ph.D. at Cornell University. She later went to work for heavyweights in the food industry, such as Nescafé and Nestlé. Her specialization in micro-encapsulation technology, which she says is “basically adding a coating to fats so they don’t dissolve easily, increasing bioavailability of active ingredients,” inspired her to create PhytoFat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous incarnations of plant-based meats used coconut oil, which melts and leaks out of the product easily. Lee’s innovation mimics real animal tissue and helps plant-based meat retain fat throughout the cooking process. Her innovations aim to make vegetarian foods on par with – if not tastier than – meat dishes like hamburger patties or high-quality steaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At the moment, about 40% of a burger is fat,” she says. “This has been overlooked in many plant-based meats. Our solution is PhytoFat, which is like animal tissue and has better flavor delivery with 33% less calories and zero cholesterol.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee’s work earned her an invitation to the UN’s COP27 climate conference, where she delivered a speech about how food production contributes to climate change. Around 30% of global carbon emissions, water use, and land use are associated with food production. Greening this production chain can bring great benefits to everyone, she stresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee believes there’s a big market for her innovation. Alternative meat represents only 2% of the sliced meat market, and Lee notes a substantial potential for growth, especially due to the contributions of flexitarians who eat meat but prefer plant-based items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are working with Louisa Coffee and their 500-plus stores, which offer six different products and flavors,” she says. “This partnership is growing and has inspired us to offer other products that target Asian cuisine, like steamed buns.” Lee’s company is already working on making the world’s first plant-based pork belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another business using technology to cater to consumer needs is Bean Friends Forever (bff), co-founded by Samson Huang. His company is a coffee subscription service that predicts a customer’s taste profile through an introductory questionnaire.</p>\r\n<figure>\r\n	<br><img src=\"/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1684228065637.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"402\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF3-1.jpg 536w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF3-1-201x300.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></figure>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our questionnaire is the secret sauce for our business,” says Huang. He says that asking just six questions can accurately predict what type of coffee a customer likes. Anything more can be overkill, and fewer questions would make customers feel the quiz is too superficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The questions asked by bff are quite common, even bordering on banal. They include “where do you shop,” “what desserts do you like,” “what kind of coffee flavor do you like,” and “where do you buy coffee?” As it turns out, these questions have a statistical significance that can help predict a person’s flavor profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After answering the questions and receiving a personalized flavor profile, customers are invited to purchase an initial shipment of single-use drip coffee packets for around NT$420 (US$12). Flavor notes and reviews from local baristas are attached to the packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bff currently has 1,000 subscribers after doubling in 2022. Aside from individual customers, the company also services offices and restaurants. “We don’t have a membership fee as we are totally based on frequency of orders,” says Huang. “Typically, a customer gets a new order every six weeks. Sometimes the contents are like a mystery box as they don’t know beforehand what’s inside.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang attributes some of the company’s success to its collaborations with numerous independent roasters, including those who roast in small quantities and want to impart their extensive knowledge of coffee to friends and fellow baristas. “We often sell our coffee to high-end restaurants, who appreciate our quality because the coffee at the end of the meal has to be quite good,” he adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huang doesn’t operate a physical store. He attends fairs and uses Google ads and search engine optimization to promote his business. So far his team is quite small, with fewer than 10 people actively promoting the company on social media and its website by sharing a few stories each week. Huang believes his highly focused, niche business model, which allows consumers to access exactly what they want at a competitive price, will play a prominent role in the future of retail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔The original article: <a href=\"https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2023/04/the-intelligent-future-of-food/\">https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2023/04/the-intelligent-future-of-food/</a>&nbsp;〕</p>', NULL, 1, '2023-05-16 09:11:41', '2023-05-16 09:11:41', NULL);

(565, '55688, the most competitive ride-hailing platform in Taiwan, transforms into a lifestyle services super app', '2023-05-30', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>55688, the biggest and most popular ride-hailing platform in Taiwan, turned into a lifestyle-focused app. The credits go to its new CEO, Tracy Lin, the daughter of the previous CEO Tsun-Tien Lin. “Even though there are 6.8 million users on our platform, we haven’t fully created the value that this large user base could bring,” said Lin. As a result, Lin has been promoting the digital transformation inside 55688, turning it into a more lifestyle-focused app that includes more lifestyle services such as dry cleaning and housekeeping besides ride-hailing.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>What makes 55688 the most competitive ride-hailing platform in Taiwan?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1685426565180.jpeg\" alt=\"林念臻_台灣大車隊執行長\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The credits of digital transformation go to its new CEO, Tracy Lin, the daughter of the previous CEO Tsun-Tien Lin. / Photograph : 蔡仁譯</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though more and more ride-hailing platforms such as Uber have operated in Taiwan, 55688 has always dominated the market with 24% market share and 80 million trips every year. One out of four taxis in Taiwan is from 55688, which is a formidable competitor in the field. “Uber entered Taiwan in 2013, however, the number of our drivers has been growing since then; In 2017, LINE TAXI also entered the market, but the number of taxi hailing tasks at 55688 has grown even faster.” said Lin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing fierce competition in taxi business, as a traditional company with a long history, 55688 has been dedicated to digital transformation with ⅕ of its annual budget invested in the internal technology department. For instance, 29 digital payment options are available at 55688. The determination to transform drew the attention of Headline Asia, one of the biggest technology-focused VC headquartered in Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, 55688 announced that Headline Asia had invested US$5M to help 55688 to expand more services for their 6.8 million users. “I can see a huge potential of 55688,” said the partner of Headline Asia Joseph Huang, “People only perceive 55688 as a ride-hailing platform, in fact, the app has become one of the best in lifestyle service sector and there is much more services closely related to users’ daily life that we can develop.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The key to success - innovation - optimization of the ride-hailing process for drunk passengers and valentines</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1685426565230.jpeg\" alt=\"台灣大車隊APP\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>55688 is now a lifestyle-focused app that includes more services such as dry cleaning and housekeeping besides ride-hailing. / Photograph : 台灣大車隊</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As both the target audience and operator of 55688, Lin always pays attention to all the unmet customer needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Lin once found that the page design of designated driving services is too complicated to understand, especially when people are tipsy, leading to the optimization of page design. Now, when we go to the page of designated driving services, the system will automatically propose the most likely options that a user would prefer by analyzing their data of user behaviors, simplifying and optimizing the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, 55688 also launched a “life secretary” service before Valentine’s day, which was ideated by the marketing and e-commerce manager at 55688, Huei-Jhen Yang. Through this service, users can reserve a taxi with flowers and chocolate inside and decorated with customized photos and messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This special service provided only 10 seats, which were sold out immediately after the launch. Thanks to the huge success, 55688 is planning to offer more diverse services for different festivals and important moments in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The key to success - audacity and decisiveness - launch new service in 1 day</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year (2022), China decided to stop importing fruits from Taiwan, causing severe and negative impact on fruit farmers in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital transformation consultant for fruit farmers in south Taiwan, Yao-Kuan Huang, was struggling to find the new buyers of the fruits that were supposed to be imported in China. In the depth of despair, he contacted Lin through the introduction by the secretary of the director of information office of Kaohsiung city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After understanding the request, Lin agreed to help solve this problem and instantly organized a temporary team to support the fruit farmers. In less than a day, the fruits products were launched on 55688.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Lin even provided coupons for ride-hailing to attract more customers to buy fruits, and the 1000 boxes of fruits were sold out in less than 10 days. This success totally impressed the fruit farmers and broke their stereotype for taxi apps like 55688.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The key to success - thoughtfulness - drivers are the most important treasure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1685426565267.jpeg\" alt=\"台灣大車隊\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important business philosophies of 55688 from the previous CEO, Tsun-Tien Lin, is to care for their drivers. &nbsp;/ Photograph : 台灣大車隊提供</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the observation from the partner of Headline Asia, Joseph Huang, what makes 55688 outstanding among all the ride-hailing platforms is their care for the drivers. This is also one of the most important business philosophies of 55688 from the previous CEO, Tsun-Tien Lin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the frontline of business, drivers’ strongly influences users’ opinons. As a result, 55688 firmly believe that they have to take good care of the drivers before taking care of users. 55688 thus provides not only a wide range of services for drivers such as repairing and car-washing but also some rules such as uniforms and the tidiness in the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aiming to become a super APP, 55688 has thrived to innovate.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, the annual revenue of 55688 increased by 24%, proving the ability and potential of the new young CEO. “However, we’ve only utilized 5% of the potential values brought from our large user base,” said Lin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin therefore aims to turn 55688 into a super APP, which provides various lifestyle services such as cleaning and moving. However, how to cooperate with the laborers who are not familiar with digital service and how to provide a consistent and standardized service to customers would be a challenge for 55688, but at the same time, a huge opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47920\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47920</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-05-30 06:03:35', '2023-09-25 13:37:49', NULL),

(572, 'Awarded Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 entrepreneur builds pet care platform attracting 60,000+ pet parents', '2023-06-20', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fluv, the visionary pet-sitting platform founded by Candace Chen, has become Taiwan\'s guardian angel for furry friends. With a surge in pet ownership, the demand for reliable pet care has soared. Fluv fills this void across Asia with its innovative online matchmaking services. Recognized for its excellence, Fluv proudly secured a spot on Forbes\' Asia 30 Under 30 list.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more Taiwanese are keeping furry friends at home. Hence, pet sitting is becoming a pain point for many owners. Imagine white collars that live alone and keep pets. What are they to do when a week-long business trip comes up? Surely, they will be on tenterhooks if no one was there to look after their furry friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a dilemma caught the eye of Candace Chen, the co-founder and CEO of Fluv. When Chen was in the U.S., she had access to a U.S. pet-sitting platform. After she returned to Taiwan, she couldn\'t find similar services. To close the gap, Chen founded Fluv, a well-loved pet-sitting platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I have first-hand experience with the hassles of finding the right pet-sitting services. Plus, I\'ve seen similar platforms overseas, so I decided to meet up with the team,\" said Chen Lijun, the Angel Investor of Fluv, director of B Current Impact Investment, and former VP of Finance at IBM Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluv specializes in online pet care matchmaking services. Chen pointed out that \"the market size of Taiwan is approximately US$716,000 (NT$22M), on par with Singapore. The Japanese market is 20 times bigger.” Clearly, the demand for pet sitting in Asia has not yet been satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2023, Forbes released its annual report of Asia 30 Under 30, awarding “300 young entrepreneurs, leaders, and trailblazers,” who exerted positive influence amid economic uncertainty. Among the list was Fluv, a proud Taiwan-based pet care platform provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1688460120856.jpeg\" alt=\"毛小愛\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluv specializes in pet care services, using an online app to match pet owners with pet sitters. / Photograph : 毛小愛</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Strictly selected pet sitter and prompt report builds word of mouth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluv currently provides an array of services catering to different animals, including birds, dogs, cats, rabbits, and rodents. Services include home care, boarding, pet walking, and grooming. Usually, cat owners will choose home care plans, while dog owners mainly opt for boarding services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app is like an Airbnb for pets – users can see the photos, prices, and animals that each pet sitter specializes in. Home care and pet walking services are provided for clients who are away; therefore, the most vital component is trust. Chen said, \"In order to build trust, we invested a great deal of effort in selecting nannies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"At first, many could not accept letting strangers into their houses,” said Chen. Fluv is very strict in the selection of pet sitters. Those who want to register on the platform must be experienced in animal care with no criminal record. Furthermore, they have to take online training and tests. Out of the initial 5,000 interviewees, only 1,500 passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While similar platforms may require nannies to take one or two photos only, Fluv nannies must take pictures of food consumed and medication taken, as well as photos that show pets playing. Furthermore, nannies are asked to monitor their feces. Clients may also rent pet cameras on the app. Much to the users’ liking, reviews of the sitter are offered, which further facilitated trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With word of mouth, the number of Fluv users reached more than 60,000. Chen added that the major attraction of the platform is the safety net it offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within 3 days after services were provided, Fluv would hand out compensation if issues were to arise. Since Fluv services come with insurance, users are further incentivized. Fluv also strives to increase the remuneration for pet sitters. Investor Chen Lijun pointed out, \"It is also important that the nanny can fully dedicate to the platform.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expected triple revenue growth</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the user retention rate of Fluv reached 50%. Chen also revealed that revenue in 2022 would exceed approximately US$325,000 (NT$10M). With border restrictions lifting and international travel booming, the demand for pet sitting is on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revenue in 2023 is expected to triple. Fluv is ready to enter Singapore, \"where many single people keep pets,” analyzed Chen. Fluv has also approached pet sitter dispatch companies in Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"In Japan, this profession has long been in practice. The Japanese are willing to accept this idea. The biggest difference is they are used to making reservations for pet sitting services on the phone.” Accordingly, the focus of the expansion to Japan will be on digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking ahead, Chen announced the plan is to leverage big data for AI-powered pet consulting services. The data includes information on pet breed, gender, and age, which help owners solve their problems through online chatbots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluv’s approach solved existing pain points. “Most veterinarians are conservative, which makes data difficult to collect. Furthermore, we pay extra attention to data privacy regulations,” said Chen. With AI, Fluv is bound to dole out more agile strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47925\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47925</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-07-04 08:43:35', '2023-09-25 13:36:40', NULL),

The Chamber emphasized the need for quick and sustained action to ensure a stable energy supply and create a more satisfying work environment to attract and retain talent. The White Paper also called for stricter adherence to the 60-day public notice and comment period for new or revised regulations, increased funding for innovative healthcare treatments, and the adoption of international practice in tendering critical public infrastructure projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the White Paper’s Messages to Washington, AmCham lauded the positive development of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade. The Chamber urged the two governments to establish a clear roadmap on how agreements under the Initiative will be executed and then move forward to negotiate a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. AmCham additionally encouraged the U.S. government to schedule routine visits to Taiwan by high-level U.S. government officials and continue efforts to promote Taiwan’s participation in relevant international organizations.\r\n	<br>In the face of global economic headwinds and cross-Strait uncertainty, a “business as usual” mindset will no longer suffice, the White Paper said. AmCham stressed the importance for Taiwan to heighten its efforts to eliminate trade barriers and improve the regulatory system to bolster Taiwan’s competitiveness. It also urged the Taiwan and U.S. governments to begin negotiations on a bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement to facilitate trade and two-way investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noting that only eight of the 102 issues raised in the 2022 White Paper have been resolved, the Chamber expressed the hope of holding more frequent meetings between its committees and the relevant Taiwan government agencies in the coming year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the press conference for the launch of this year’s White Paper, AmCham Taiwan thanked the National Development Council for its annual efforts in coordinating the government’s response to the Chamber’s recommendations, as well as the relevant government ministries and agencies for their cooperation in addressing challenging regulatory issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47928\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47928</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-07-04 08:47:34', '2023-09-25 13:36:21', NULL),

(579, 'Dotdot unveils one-fit-all payment solution for food businesses', '2023-07-28', '', '<blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Dotdot, a four-year-old fintech startup, launches its innovative product, DDPay. The move marks a significant shift towards digitization for small-scale eateries and more restaurants, a largely untapped market plagued with inefficiencies and labor shortages. The new service built on its main service online ordering platform, will further perfect user experiences with fast and digital processes.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotdot has made a splash since its establishment in 2019 under the leadership of CEO Ting Hsieh. Today, with over 15,000 users, 80 million unique users per month, and a staggering total of 50 million orders, Dotdot\'s services have facilitated online financial transactions worth 30 billion. The numbers illustrate an undeniable trend: the era of non-cash payments has arrived, with small-scale eateries increasingly keen to adopt digital solutions. Dotdot positions the product as “payment as a service”, aiming to boost online payments for all businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We have witnessed a changing era. In the last three years, the industry has lost nearly 3,000 employees while gaining 20,000 new establishments. Meanwhile, labor costs have skyrocketed, accounting for nearly 40% of expenses,\" said Ting Hsieh, CEO of Dotdot. \"We are committed to easing the burden on these small-scale operations, providing a streamlined solution to save them valuable time, improve service, and reduce labor demands.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1690767341771.jpeg\" alt=\"點點全球執行長謝瑞庭發表了創新支付服務「點點付 DDPay」\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotdot positions the product as “payment as a service”, aiming to boost online payments for all businesses. /Photograph : 點點全球</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hsieh pointed out that the time-consuming tasks of taking phone orders and manual billing take up valuable resources for these establishments, thus taking away from their core service - providing delicious food. He believes non-cash payment is the future, and the Dot Dot Payment solution is designed to simplify this transition, offering a complete, one-stop payment service. It supports QR-based payment methods, and contactless transactions, and eliminates the hassle of dealing with multiple third-party payment providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"After payment completion, everything from electronic receipts to loyalty points and carrier services can be handled at one point. We have even integrated services that allow establishments to join the social app LINE members system to help them manage their businesses,\" Hsieh added.\r\n	<br>The new product also promises to resolve one of the major pain points for small businesses – reconciling accounts. The DDPay solution enables businesses to reconcile their accounts via cloud services, offering a streamlined, unified platform for efficient business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bogi Huang, COO of Dotdot, added, \"In the wake of the pandemic, even small-scale and single-person food businesses are gradually accepting digital payment methods. Online payments speed up the process compared to traditional order-taking and cash handling. Our Dot Dot Payment solution is poised to usher these establishments into the future of seamless, digital transactions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1690767379051.jpeg\" alt=\"點點全球點點付支援信用卡感應支付\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DDPay solution enables businesses to reconcile their accounts via cloud services, offering a streamlined, unified platform for efficient business operations. /Photograh : 點點全球</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotdot Global\'s DDPay service operates through a self-developed interface known as DDUPI, which integrates various online payment channels. The system comprises three core technologies: DDPH for barcodes, DDQR for QR Code scanning, and DDTAP for credit card payments. These are connected through the pre-existing MAP (Member Aggregation Platform) interface, seamlessly integrating features to manage customer membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joel Tay, CEO of Soft Space, which provides contactless credit card payment technology, shared his insights on Dotdot\'s innovative approach. \"Dotdot is the first food tech service platform in Taiwan to provide SoftPOS payment application services,\" he said, \"by utilizing the existing POS machines of businesses and adding contactless credit card payment methods, Dotdot has achieved two major advantages: quick deployment and reduced operational costs. This not only benefits the businesses but also offers consumers a seamless and secure contactless payment experience.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotdot\'s use of innovative tech, like Soft Space\'s contactless payment technology, represents a significant step forward in payment solutions. This strategic move towards providing a frictionless experience for both businesses and consumers further solidifies Dotdot\'s commitment to harnessing technology to transform the payment landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Starting as an online ordering platform, Dotdot thrives out of an “accident”</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1690767415969.jpeg\" alt=\"點點全球點點付也支援非餐飲業者的支付\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dotdot team’s ability to spot a problem and turn it into an opportunity demonstrates the company\'s innovative spirit. /Photograh : 點點全球提供</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Dotdot begins with a simple lunch outing. Bogi Huang and his engineering team found themselves struggling with an overly complicated order machine at a local eatery. This moment sparked the question, \"Is it really that hard? Why don\'t we just build one ourselves?\" This idea birthed the prototype of Dotdot\'s global solution. Initially, it started as a side project – an ordering system that was introduced in May 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in just six months, the number of businesses using their system soared to 4,500, generating a turnover of more than 300 million. The unexpected success inspired Huang to establish a company and focus on nurturing this promising venture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dotdot’s solution capitalizes on technology tools that Taiwanese people use most frequently: LINE. Customers only need to add the restaurant\'s official LINE account to place orders online. The platform offers an array of choices, allowing customers to choose between pick-up, take-out, or delivery. The system seamlessly integrates with popular online payment methods such as Line Pay, making the process extremely convenient for consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dotdot team’s ability to spot a problem and turn it into an opportunity demonstrates the company\'s innovative spirit. The journey from an awkward encounter with a lunch ordering machine to the creation of a robust, user-friendly digital platform embodies Dotdot’s commitment to improving customer experience. This dedication, coupled with their knack for leveraging existing technologies, has been key in Dotdot\'s rapid expansion and success. As the company ventures into the payment solution market, it’s clear that its customer-centric, problem-solving ethos will continue to guide its growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47938\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47938</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2023-07-31 01:38:44', '2023-09-25 13:35:33', NULL),

TWSE hopes to improve the information transparency of listed companies, enhance its competitiveness among international markets, and continue to attract foreign investment to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Taiwan\'s capital market has shown tremendous strength with resilient fundamentals, high dividend returns, and a complete upstream and downstream supply chain in information and communication technology (ICT) industry. The recent AI frenzy, together with the expected end to US rate hikes, has attracted the foreign capital flow to return to Taiwan\'s stock market. So far in 2023, the proportion of foreign capital in Taiwan stocks exceeded 40%, which has driven up stock prices in Taiwan. According to data from TWSE, as of June 30, Taiwan\'s stock market was up 19.65% for the year, ranking fourth among the world\'s major stock markets, and second only to the Japanese stock market 27% among Asian stock markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total revenue of listed companies in Taiwan hit a record high of USD 1.31 trillion in 2022, with an annual growth rate of more than 5%. Judging from the estimated distributable cash for dividends, the estimated dividend yield is close to 5%, ranking among the best in the world. Among the constituent stocks of the Taiwan stock index, listed companies in technology, semiconductors and electronic components have a combined weight of more than 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Optimization of information disclosure with a one-stop service platform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Investment InfoHub website aims to provide investors with one-stop integrated information services for making investment decisions. It integrates important information from the official website of the TWSE, Market Observation Post System and Market Information System websites. The key information of the markets and listed companies are presented with graphics and visualized analytic reports, providing investors with infographics to facilitate their use in comparison and analysis. In addition, all data reports provide outputs in various file formats such as pictures and tables, allowing investors to further process and utilize the data. By establishing the Investment InfoHub website, TWSE hopes to provide investors, especially foreign institutional investors, with a one-stop access to crucial reference materials needed for making investment decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1691485615739.jpeg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The TWSE\'s Investment InfoHub website offers integrated information services for investors to facilitate their investment decision-making.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ESG InfoHub website integrates ESG information, ESG products and other data from listed companies to make ESG-related information more accessible and useful to investors as an investment reference. Investors may use the platform to look for E (Environment), S (Social), and G (Governance) information of specific companies, and make comparison between companies and across industries to identify the opportunities in the ESG market. The launch of ESG InfoHub, which aims to facilitate ESG investment and drives sustainable finance, represents a critical milestone in the TWSE\'s commitment to promoting the ESG ecosystem, making ESG a competitive advantage for Taiwanese companies in the global market and enhancing the international competitiveness of the capital market as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1691485869442.png\" style=\"width: 900px;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" data-result=\"success\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The TWSE\'s ESG InfoHub website consolidates ESG data and products from listed companies, making them easily accessible and valuable to investors as an investment reference.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopting the approach of \"Taiwan going out, the world coming in”, led by Chairman Sherman Lin, TWSE will arrange a delegation visit to New York, the global financial hub, for overseas roadshows and physical meetings with important institutional investors in September, in addition to their visits to Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Vietnam during the first half of the year. The upcoming visit to New York aims to bolster Taiwan\'s positioning in the international capital market, build long-term relationships and collaboration with major international financial institutions, and attract more foreign investment flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Launching new economy industry index to cover four new industry categories</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with ESG InfoHub and Investment InfoHub, TWSE has also launched several new key measures in July, including adjustments to the industry classification of listed companies by adding four new categories, namely \"Digital and Cloud Services\" (four companies), \"Sports and Leisure\" (15 companies), \"Green Energy and Environmental Services\" (12 companies), and \"Household\" (11 companies), which allows distinctive listed companies to benefit from a clustering effect and draw the attention of investors. Taking the world\'s largest sports footwear OEM Pou Chen Group and the world\'s leading bicycle manufacturer Giant Group as examples, the two conglomerates, which were originally listed under the \"Other\" category, will be included in the \"Sports and Leisure\" industry category starting from July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tandem with the above measures, TWSE will also launch the \"Taiwan New Economy Industry Index\", which covers the listed companies of the four said new industries, as well as the \"Taiwan Innovation Board Index\" to highlight Taiwan\'s new economy companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the TWSE is set to launch a new Corporate Identification System (CIS) in July since the last update 15 years ago in 2008, the new CIS design aims to convey the importance of innovation highly valued by the TWSE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TWSE provides introductory videos for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azqe9xJR_B8\">ESG InfoHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZAi_u1XnZo\">Investment InfoHub</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information, please contact Mr. Tsai at <a href=\"mailto:1193@twse.com.tw\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1193@twse.com.tw</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔The original article: <a href=\"https://twmonthly.twse.com.tw/front/content/8a8185be8915fd3301894d5b75880005?date=\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan Stock Exchange set to further attract foreign capital with newly launched ESG InfoHub and Investment InfoHub</a>〕</p>', NULL, 1, '2023-08-08 09:16:11', '2023-09-25 13:33:13', NULL),

Emphasizing creativity and originality, the crowdfunding platform had over 60% of pledged money going to projects featuring original creations such as the world’s first palm-sized laser engraver provider Cubiio.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As Taiwan’s first crowdfunding platform, Zeczec marked its milestone by pledging over $300 million altogether for 7,000 projects. Quake Hsu, the co-founder of Zeczec, emphasized the platform\'s unwavering commitment to three key pillars: fostering genuine originality, celebrating the richness of Taiwanese cultures, and catalyzing local industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We not only contribute to these three core values in the last decade, but also we would like to level up and speed up market validation for original creativity,” said Hsu. Taking this commitment a step further, Zeczec is launching a subsidiary to directly invest in innovative and original ideas. This strategic move not only underscores the platform’s dedication to nurturing early-stage creativity but also equips budding ideas with the necessary resources and support, aiding them in their growth journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Zeczec: A Global Contender in the Crowdfunding Arena</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1694597041949.jpeg\" alt=\"Global Crowdfunding Platforms \" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zeczec has pledged over US$300 million within a decade and boasts a success rate of over 78% for its crowdfunding projects, ranking No.1 in project success rate. / Image Credits: Wendy Wu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the dynamic world of crowdfunding, Zeczec has emerged as a formidable force, not just within Taiwan but on the global stage as well. While platforms like Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and Japan\'s Campfire have long been recognized names in the crowdfunding universe, Zeczec\'s commitment to fostering creativity and originality sets it apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform has pledged over US$300 million within a decade and boasts a success rate of over 78% for its crowdfunding projects. This high success rate is a testament to its dedication to innovation and its deep-seated belief in the potential of original ideas. While the global crowdfunding giant Kickstarter has seen more than 70 billion dollars pledged and a 39.4% success rate, Japan’s crowdfunding platform, Campfire, has a total pledged amount of over 500 million and a success rate of 26% for projects reaching their funding goals. Indiegogo, which doesn’t disclose its total funded amount, has a success rate of only 9%. The combination of its user-centric approach, robust infrastructure, and keen market insights makes Zeczec a promising contender in the future of crowdfunding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Zeczec gears up to challenge the giants in the crowdfunding realm, the company has set ambitious targets for itself. Determined to grow both rapidly and strategically, Zeczec has embarked on an audacious journey to amass its next US$300 million within a span of just three years, targeting 2026. To speed up its crowdfunding pace, Zeczec adopts a strategy of selecting and marketing projects with strong cultural roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Setting off a craze of eco-friendly beverage cups and classic literature, Zeczec becomes a cultural hub</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1694597067477.jpeg\" alt=\"嘖嘖創辦人徐震\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an era where ideas transcend borders and innovation knows no bounds, Zeczec stands poised to be a beacon for creators and innovators worldwide. / Image Credits: 嘖嘖</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout its journey, Zeczec has been instrumental in propelling numerous products from different industries into the spotlight. The platform\'s impressive success stories speak to its efficacy and impact. Notably, Hiding Tou, marked one of the most supported projects on the platform, has produced the “national beverage cup”. With an initial goal of NT$ 1,000,000, the campaign amassed an astonishing NT$ 38,289,487 from 31,089 supporters, indicating the vast potential and appeal of native Taiwanese products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Yuan-Liou Publishing, the renowned publishing house, has successfully utilized Zeczec to rejuvenate and reintroduce a series of novels by the legendary Chinese writer Jin Yong, whose works have garnered sales of over 300 million copies globally. In a similar vein, the celebrated “Agatha Christie: The Queen of Crime”, has also been freshly relaunched on the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional Taiwanese industries are witnessing an evolution of business models, with individuals leveraging the platform to foster collaborations, as seen in a collaboration melding 80 years of traditional Japanese craftsmanship with Taiwanese design. This fusion culminated in products that blend Taiwan\'s innovative designs with Japan\'s impeccable manufacturing standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Zeczec extends its reach beyond Taiwan\'s shores, inviting international talents and brilliant ideas to the island. The platform successfully funded over 1,400 cultural content projects. An English illustrator Tom Parker, through the platform\'s support, was able to complete his illustrative masterpiece, the “Taipei Map.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZwUCNEN90qA?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw\" title=\"《台北地圖》藝術家專訪 | Taipei map illustrator interview 中文字幕\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-43=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-48=\"true\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-81=\"true\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an era where ideas transcend borders and innovation knows no bounds, Zeczec stands poised to be a beacon for creators and innovators worldwide.

Taiwan is renowned not only for its convenience and breathtaking landscapes but also as an irresistible choice for digital talents seeking not just career opportunities but also an exquisite quality of life.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.internations.org/expat-insider/2023/best-and-worst-places-for-expats-40353\" target=\"_blank\">annual survey</a> by \"InterNations\" website, Taiwan ranks among the top countries for expatriates to live in. The website conducts an annual survey involving over 12,000 expats in 53 cities worldwide, assessing quality of life, financial development, healthcare services, job friendliness, and other indicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2022-2023 survey, Taiwan achieved #2 in the quality of life index and #1 in \"health and welfare.\" 98% of respondents consider Taiwan is very safe to live in, and 84% find most Taiwanese to be very friendly, far exceeding the global average of 66%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taiwan: Embracing Global Digital Professionals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We have always been actively assisting international talents in obtaining the Taiwan Employment Gold Card to work or start businesses in Taiwan,\" said Betty Hu, the Deputy Director General of Administration for Digital Industries, Moda. \"In Taiwan, professionals in digital industries can immerse themselves in an established high-tech industry to accelerate their career development; and they can also stimulate local tech companies and communities, encouraging them to build connections with global professionals regularly.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwanese government has shown a strong commitment to developing the digital industry and welcoming international digital talents for years. In 2022, Taiwan established the Ministry of Digital Affairs and invited world-renowned tech expert Audrey Tang as Minister to directly participate in government decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49LXhCh\" target=\"_blank\">the Taiwan Employment Gold</a> Card for digital professionals is one of Taiwan\'s key policies of the Ministry of Digital Development, aimed at actively welcoming international digital talents to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taiwan Employment Gold Card: Warm welcome to global professionals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan Employment Gold Card integrates four important services: a more flexible work permit, a residence visa valid for up to three years, eligibility for national health insurance, and income tax reduction. Holders of the Taiwan Employment Gold Card can enter and exit Taiwan at will and work remotely from any city around the world, offering greater flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Taiwan Employment Gold Card for the Digital Field uses a diverse set of evaluation criteria, focusing on an individual\'s achievements and qualifications in the digital field, such as academics, projects, certifications, or patents. This shift enables a more comprehensive assessment and offers applicants greater flexibility, allowing them to work for a company or start their own business upon arrival in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of November 1st, the Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office has expanded into the International Talent Taiwan Office, providing better services. It offers consultation services to both cardholders and their family members. Legal and accounting firms will also provide consulting services at the center. There is also a community for cardholders to ensure ongoing assistance for both cardholders and their families after their arrival in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taiwan: Ideal for Digital Industry Development</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1701657807888.jpeg\" alt=\"bn_1707x766-V2 (1)\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image Credits: Ministry of Digital Affairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given geopolitical circumstances, Taiwan has a high demand for various digital technology fields, including cybersecurity and blockchain. \"Taiwan is one of the best locations for cybersecurity teams to demonstrate their capabilities,\"said Betty Hu. \"Taiwan\'s openness and democracy create a highly welcoming environment for digital professionals.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Not just in cybersecurity and blockchain; Taiwan also has a high demand for people working in FIDO, autonomous driving and quantum computing.\" Betty Hu stated. Both enterprises (like Google, Microsoft, AWS, IBM and Meta) and startups (like Appier and Gogolook) have been able to find successful business models in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, Google, which has been operating in Taiwan for more than 15 years, has established the largest data center in Asia and continues to expand its operations, collaborating with research centers and universities in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the Taiwan-based artificial intelligence startup, Appier, with AI SaaS as its core service, has successfully gone public in Japan, with an estimated market value of over USD 1.35 billion, demonstrating the promising prospects of Taiwan\'s digital industry on the global market.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Balancing Work and Life: Achieving Harmony in Taiwan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is more than just a friendly society but also ranks among the top nations globally in terms of quality of life, healthcare accessibility, freedom of speech, marriage equality, and government efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that has attracted numerous open-source communities and global tech leaders, such as Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, and Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, to become Taiwan Employment Gold Card holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwan is a country known for its rich culture and abundant natural experiences. It is highly inclusive of various international cultures, making it an ideal place for families with children to reside long-term. \"Taiwan\'s major cities are very close to nature, making it easy to access for both families and individuals,\" recommended by Betty Hu, \"It\'s a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy activities like rowing and mountain climbing.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49OdUNJ\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan Employment Gold Card</a>, achieving work-life balance in Taiwan is not a dream.

With the easing of the global pandemic and the alleviation of supply chain bottlenecks, countries worldwide are strategizing to rejuvenate their industrial economies. For many countries, this means enlivening the startup ecosystem through various strategic measures. For example, Japan introduced a five-year entrepreneurship development plan at the end of 2022 while in 2023, South Korea launched a comprehensive entrepreneurship policy. The United States designated 31 technology hubs (Tech Hubs) to foster regional startups and enhance competitiveness. Further, the G20 introduced the Startup20 strategy, encouraging member countries to foster and connect startup development and thereby stimulate global entrepreneurial ecosystem growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, various ministries have actively supported the development of startups, with innovation and entrepreneurship as key approaches to driving economic growth. To strengthen these efforts, entrepreneurship has become a vital part of policy planning via inspiration from international innovation and entrepreneurship support practices. Support for startups is now key among the responsibilities of the Small and Medium Enterprise and Startup Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the goals of accelerating the growth and transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enhancing international competitiveness, and establishing solid partnerships with local and foreign enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features and Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are known for their flexibility and resilience, and many have become “hidden champions” in the global supply chain. These enterprises often engage in external innovation by collaborating with startups and external teams and by integrating outside resources, ideas, and innovations to drive transformation and upgrading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Startups in Taiwan are adept at incorporating digital technologies into their business models, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data to assist traditional industries, service sectors, and cultural creative fields in digital transformation. Startups are also crucial for businesses looking to introduce innovative technologies, develop new products, and enter new markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support the development of innovation and entrepreneurship, the government has been conducting foundational courses and activities in this area for many years. Assistance is provided at various stages of entrepreneurship, for example, through platforms such as the startup.sme.gov website and online universities, which enhance entrepreneurial skills. The government encourages large enterprises and industry alliances to invest in the startup ecosystem, funneling cross-sector resources into new ventures. Additionally, international-grade entrepreneurial clusters like Linkou and Yawan Startup Terraces were established to attract more international startups. These initiatives, alongside innovation research grants and supply chain integration, aim to enhance the innovation value of industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coordination and Collaboration<br></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developments in emerging technologies such as generative AI, sustainable fuels, sustainable computing, flexible soft batteries, and sensors, are driving changes in industries like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, aviation, shipping, and agriculture. The entrepreneurial projects of these startups are diverse, often involving cross-industry and emerging domain issues. These startups &nbsp;face various entry barriers, including financial, regulatory, and experimental challenges, thereby requiring support from sectors such as government, industry, academia, and research. This collaboration creates opportunities for cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support economic growth and enhance competitiveness, government ministries must actively participate and offer support. Through inter-ministerial communication and coordination, emerging industry issues can be addressed, and industry barriers reduced. The development of startups requires the joint assistance of the government, incubation organizations, venture capitalists, and research centers. Let\'s work together to contribute to innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/home/modules/download/\"><strong>Watch the guidebook</strong></a></p>', NULL, 1, '2024-01-12 03:08:30', '2024-01-12 03:09:04', NULL),

Co-founded by Ethan Fu and Kate Liao, Elkroom originated as a side project. Their combined experience in app development and a shared passion for gaming led to the creation of OXO Game Launcher, which recently updated with its AI feature, automatically capturing best moments of gameplay and enabling gamers to share.</p>\r\n	</blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>Mobile gaming, increasingly a primary source of entertainment, often faces issues like lag, intrusive notifications, and stuttering gameplay, which can spoil the fun. Elkroom, co-founded by avid gamer Ethan Fu, steps in with a solution to these problems.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fu, CEO of Elkroom, was inspired by solutions such as Samsung\'s Game Launcher, aimed at optimizing the mobile gaming experience. \"Samsung\'s feature made me a loyal user,\" Fu remarks. However, he recognized a gap in the market: brand-specific optimizations. Major players like Samsung and Xiaomi offer game launchers, but these are confined to their respective ecosystems, leaving many gamers without optimization options.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fu\'s passion for gaming led him to develop the OXO Game Launcher, which transcends the basic designs of existing accelerators by focusing on sophistication and community engagement. Elkroom\'s OXO is universally accessible, catering to various mobile brands, and integrates strengths from different platforms to enhance gaming performance and foster community among gamers.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In just three years, the OXO Game Launcher has built an impressive user base, with over 5.5 million downloads globally. Its rapid growth highlights the demand for a more inclusive, brand-neutral tool that enhances the gaming experience across a wide range of mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Moreover, the launcher recently updated with its new AI\'s highlight editing feature, which automatically picks out the best moments from gamers\'gameplay. The 1-minute highlight reel out of a 30-mintute video game allows gamers to memorize their MVP moments, and to share on social media with one click. Elkroom continues to facilitate gamer experience as an multipurpose tool.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>As Elkroom continues to grow and evolve, its journey reflects a deeper understanding of mobile gamers\' pain points and a commitment to addressing them innovatively and inclusively. With OXO Game Launcher, Elkroom isn\'t just optimizing games; it\'s building a community for gamers.</p>\r\n\r\n	<h3>The Birth of Elkroom: A side project turned game changer</h3><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2023-10/img-1698396087-78279.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Elkroom團隊\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48023\">In just three years, OXO Game Launcher has garnered an impressive user base, with over 5.5 million downloads globally. / Image Credits: Maurice Tsai\r\n\r\n	<p>\r\n		<br>\r\n	</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The inception of Elkroom was not intended to disrupt the mobile gaming world. Ethan Fu, Kate Liao, and David Chen started Elkroom as a side project, driven by convenience and a shared love for gaming and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fu\'s rich background in app development, including his contributions to popular apps like Clean Master and CM Security at Cheetah Mobile and Trend Micro, laid the groundwork for his entrepreneurial journey. During his master\'s degree, he began experimenting with product development, finding the process intriguing.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Fu and Liao, who met at Cheetah Mobile and shared a passion for animation and gaming, discussed starting a venture together. Liao, a New York-based designer, had a wealth of ideas and a strong desire to innovate in the gaming field.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>David Chen, who later became Elkroom\'s CTO, met Fu at Trend Micro. Over six years, they bonded through daily gaming sessions and discussions about technology and innovation. Their collaboration, fueled by their mutual love for games and David\'s technical skills, formed the basis for their successful partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>As the trio worked on their side project, they realized its potential. Serious development discussions began in October 2019, leading to the app\'s launch in February 2020. Focusing on AI development and an iOS version emphasizing social interaction, they aimed to create a product that went beyond gaming to cultivate a community. The game launcher quickly gained one million downloads in its first year, prompting the team to commit full-time to the project.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>〔Original :Meet Global〕\r\n		<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48023\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48023</a></p>\r\n</div>', NULL, 1, '2024-02-07 09:23:41', '2024-02-07 09:23:41', NULL),

It\'s a scene of organized chaos, a testament to the countless trials and tests he\'s conducted in his quest to perfect his latest prototype. With hands-on dedication, Hall is assembling what he believes to be not just another motorbike but a new chapter in outdoor adventure.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Paka Electric, a startup working on electric motorbikes, is spearheaded by Hall, whose diverse background includes work with UN Habitat and World Bicycle Relief. Central to Paka Electric\'s design is the Pakalot system, an innovation born out of Hall\'s commitment to utility and inclusivity. This system’s open-source nature is an invitation – a call to bikers, tinkerers, and dreamers to join in and add their innovations to their demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what\'s most striking about this motorbike is its cargo system, cleverly integrated into the frame. This isn\'t a proprietary, lock-you-in kind of design; it\'s straightforward, using standard strut channel components you can find in any local hardware store, which allows you to attach just about any accessory anywhere on the bike. Hall presented to us how quick and easy to assemble the additional seats and storage baskets with his own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As a family or as a worker, you can make your own motorbikes that fit you the best by adding on these accessories, with no limitation,” said the founder. Hall regards the motorbike as a platform for creativity, where the accessories, much like apps on a smartphone, are developed and shared within the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From Kenya to Taiwan: Andrew Hall is a veteran in the bicycle industry</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-02/img-1708055440-17788.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Paka Electric\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Taiwan, Hall discovered not just the high-quality bicycle manufacturing that the island is known for, but also a community eager to embrace innovation. &nbsp;/ Image Credits: Wend Wu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Hall\'s journey to founding Paka Electric took a pivotal turn during his tenure in Kenya with World Bicycle Relief. For a decade, this American immersed himself in creating heavy-duty, affordable vehicles in Kenya, a role that deeply influenced his approach to product design and development. His time with World Bicycle Relief as a Product Manager and in Operations in Kisumu, Kenya, from April 2010 to August 2016, laid the foundation for his future endeavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience in Kenya, dealing with commercial vehicles and heavy-duty tools, led Hall to a pivotal moment in his career: a transition to product development in Taiwan for the same company. It was in Taiwan, particularly in Taichung, that Hall discovered the high quality of bicycle manufacturing, a revelation that steered his path towards the creation of Paka Electric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“As a guy who spent a decade in the bicycle industry, it’s always nice to be close to the supply chain, so here I am,” said Hall. In Taiwan, Hall discovered not just the high-quality bicycle manufacturing that the island is known for, but also a community eager to embrace innovation. Taiwan proved to be a fertile ground for Hall\'s vision. He found a community eager to participate in trials, early adopters who were influential in sectors like farming. This initial support was crucial, providing Hall with immediate feedback and a real-world testing ground for his prototypes. The Taiwanese customers, with their specific needs like carrying heavy loads over significant distances, shaped the development of Paka Electric\'s motorbikes. Hall designed them to be robust, with a 20kg battery capacity and a range of 45-60 kilometers, ideal for applications like last-mile deliveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What made Taiwan an even more appealing base for Hall and Paka Electric was the welcoming business environment. Hall and his family felt embraced by the local culture. The ease of interaction, the openness of small shops to new ideas, and their willingness to experiment were invaluable to a startup like Paka Electric.</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48025\">\r\n\r\n	<h3>Paka Electric\'s Solution for the US Market: The \"Just Right\" Trusty Trucker</h3><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-02/img-1708055332-62760.jpeg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Paka Electric 1\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">Paka Electric\'s Trusty Trucker.

Over 150 million Americans - encompassing farmers, hunters, park rangers, land managers, law enforcement, and outdoor adventurers - make the outdoors their workplace and playground. For these individuals, the outdoors is not just a setting; it\'s an integral part of their daily life.

Traditional four-wheeled vehicles, although robust, are often expensive, too bulky for narrow trails, noisy, polluting, and complex to maintain, often requiring a dedicated trailer. Conversely, two-wheeled options like scooters, minibikes, and dirt bikes, though more accessible, have their own drawbacks. They typically produce noise and pollution, lack sufficient cargo capacity, have fixed seat heights resulting in discomfort, struggle on rough terrain, have limited ground clearance, and cannot pull trailers.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Paka Electric\'s Trusty Trucker. This vehicle is designed to hit the sweet spot for the American outdoors market. It stands out as a friendly, clean, and quiet alternative that is adept at conquering challenging terrains. The Trusty Trucker addresses all the pain points of existing outdoor transportation options. It\'s designed to be robust yet flexible, capable of handling various terrains while providing enough cargo capacity for different needs. Its design considers the rider\'s comfort and safety, making it suitable for extended use in varied outdoor conditions. But what really sets the Trusty Trucker apart is its affordability.

Many people need to find quiet and convenient spaces to meet in private,\" said Happ. co-founder and Chief Business Officer Chang Wen-hsin (張文馨).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ. operates 300 spaces in the Taipei area, 11 in Taichung, and nine in Tainan. There are plans to expand across all of the major cities in Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Cozy private space</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“Rather than meeting at a coffee shop, Chang says, “some people opt for their space when sensitive information cannot be discussed in public or when the individuals involved may be easily recognizable to the public.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Many people will rent our spaces for things like tutoring lessons, therapy sessions, or simply for friends to get together after a day of shopping,” she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang explained that the rental process is simple and streamlined, with users choosing different spaces from a map with detailed images of the interior, including a list of furnishings, and after making a payment online, a numbered passcode is sent to their phone right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arriving at the location, one simply enters the passcode into an electronic panel on the door, which opens and provides access to amenities such as a table, chairs, whiteboard, extension cords, projector, and WiFi. Each room is cleaned shortly after use, and occupants are encouraged to keep rooms clean and leave with their garbage to be deposited in bins located in the hallway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" alt=\"Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan\" src=\"https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708072124-65cf1cbc3408d.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>A room near MRT Dongmen station. (Happ.&nbsp;photo)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID pandemic led more companies to experiment with remote working, creating new opportunities and new work models that broke traditional geographical boundaries. Chang said the main users are typically tech-savvy young people aged 20–40, though her company is making inroads into older demographic groups who may use the service to book rooms for gatherings with friends and family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Aside from giving workers more freedom to choose to work from home during the pandemic, it also allowed companies to save on business rent and create a lean and efficient business culture. It also showed that office work does not need to be confined to office buildings.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang said start-ups were the first organizations to embrace Happ.’s space-for-hire business model, followed by international corporate and tech companies that needed “project offices” for longer periods, such as a few months or a fiscal quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We learned that workers still like to meet person-to-person, and our company provides this service for companies.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" alt=\"Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan\" src=\"https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708072084-65cf1c94da9c4.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>A colorful meeting space near MRT Dongmen station. (Happ. photo)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tough times during COVID</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Happ.’s original name, \"Treerful,” was inspired by the English term “cheerful,” and the intention was to create a cozy environment with each space consistent in design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each newly created room has to pass an internal review process to qualify as an available rental space. While most spaces pass, there are always one or two adjustments that can be made based on suggestions from reviewers. “We have a review process for each room where we take into account things like comfortability, lighting, and other issues.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This attention to detail has improved the overall experience of Happ.’s users and helped the company rise to the top of the temporary space rental market in Taiwan. The company’s Mandarin name has become synonymous with the service it provides, quite an achievement for a company founded just eight years ago, modeled after a similar space-for-hire company based in Montreal, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang admitted there has been a loss of competition in the market, while a large number of companies were unable to weather the challenges brought about by the COVID pandemic. This led to three years of declines in business volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led the company to seek new ways to offer new properties. This led to more partnerships and profit sharing with property owners rather than direct leasing of spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“At the beginning, we just rushed to get the spaces ready in the most cost-effective way. We did this by just leasing many of our spaces from landlords,” said Chang. The company later modified its business model by partnering with property owners, allowing it to grow to more locations, albeit slower, across Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also experimented with a greater diversity of spaces it offers, such as tiny phone booth-type spaces suited for single people requiring a private space for a conference call in busy urban areas such as Zhongshan Station. Happ. is now offering 16 overnight spaces near Taipei Main Station, which can be used day and night, also providing a short rest service for travelers who need to catch a late-night train or flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overnight option charges just NT$190 (US$6) per hour; it’s an affordable option for those who require a few hours of rest rather than a full day of amenities provided by a typical hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" alt=\"Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan\" src=\"https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708071878-65cf1bc6f1394.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>One of the Happ.\'s overnight spaces. (Happ. photo)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Making it happen</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The backbone of Happ. is an IT system that automates everything from space registration to payment to consumer contact. Chang says all of the software has been developed by company co-founder Jimmy Huang, who has a software engineering background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While much of the company’s operations are automated, there is no escaping the fact that human labor is often involved in the cleaning and maintenance of each space for hire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“For our industry, it’s a major accomplishment if we can automate more than 50% of our operations. We need to clean some of the rooms three times a day as our costs are not as cheap as some people may think.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another downside of this emerging industry in Taiwan is the number of platforms offered by competitors such as Pickone. “After we started the brand, many other operators have learned how to do this business from us,” said Chang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In East Asia, two leading brands in the space industry are Spacemarket and Instabase, both of which are publicly listed space rental platforms in Japan. They offer a variety of spaces for activities like birthday parties, photography, and meetings. Their business model involves charging transaction fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to a growing demand for small conference call meeting spaces in some business districts, one innovation that Happ. began to offer workbooths, which allow a single individual to go into a small space complete with a power source, WiFi, and a door that provides privacy. The phonebooth model was popularized in Japan and can now be found at many JR stations, where they are called “telecubes.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" alt=\"Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan\" src=\"https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708071819-65cf1b8b7c429.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>(Happ. photo)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang believes that such innovation is vital for all companies working in this industry segment. “We need to do what we can to provide a good user experience. We need to find out if the space is comfortable. For example, is this desk suitable for work?\" Brand differentiation is a big challenge to the company, which is developing a customer loyalty program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We have a lot of off-line workers that we depend upon to maintain our spaces and do other duties such as supervise new construction or oversee our interior design.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chang said that after being in business for a few years, the company began taking a long, hard look at its corporate image, which included a new corporate logo and a corporate identity pack detailing all of the design specifications for each new space, website design, and other materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“It’s now a little bit of a game for us to see what interview on TV or the internet was conducted in one of our spaces,” Chang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original : Taiwan News 〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5096923\">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5096923</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2024-02-22 05:39:15', '2024-02-22 05:39:15', NULL),

Feng Ruei Guo (pictured on the right), the co-founder of GitRoll, remarked, \" Unlike our past experiences, we\'ve learned the importance of targeting the right market needs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, they are targeting the pain point of \"difficulty finding engineers\" and releasing an evaluation system that scans through engineers\' code to assess their coding ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one hand, GitRoll assists engineers who possess the ability but are constrained by factors such as their educational background or experience to find a job that matches their abilities. On the other hand, it helps enterprises eliminate unqualified choices and discover undiscovered talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-03/img-1711612955-85293.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Gitroll diagram\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitRoll not only assists engineers with capabilities but hindered by factors such as education and experience to find jobs commensurate with their abilities but also aids enterprises in weeding out unsuitable candidates while seeking out undiscovered talent. / Image Credits: GitRoll官網</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Breaking the Academic Job Myth: GitRoll Introduces Programming Proficiency Scanner</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the right engineer quickly is the key for all technology companies and startups. However, besides possessing excellent individual skills, whether a good engineer can effectively integrate into the team and collaborate with other engineers is also crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitRoll co-founder Cho Hsuan Yu (pictured in the top image) expressed that current enterprises often screen engineer talents based on external factors such as academic qualifications and relevant experiences during engineer recruitment. However, such practices may easily overlook engineers with less impressive diplomas. Additionally, relying solely on programming tests may not accurately reflect the candidate\'s ability to maintain programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing the issues in the current recruitment systems, GitRoll combines the programming expertise of its team members with their backgrounds in enterprise promotion. They aim to develop a coding proficiency assessment system that can \'break down academic barriers\' and help compensate for the deficiencies of existing methods. \'We\'re like what \'Moneyball\' did in the movie; we speak through data rather than experience,\' said Feng Ruei Guo with a smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The software engineer talent search engine launched by the GitRoll team categorizes individuals using data, much like \'Moneyball\', challenging the traditional notion that coding ability couldn\'t be quantified and assisting companies in finding suitable candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Communication is Key: GitRoll Determines Engineer Value Through \'Five Forces\'</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'re using the GitRoll product, all HR needs to do is input the GitHub pages of their engineer candidates, and they can get an analysis of their coding ability within a few minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Security: Whether there are any cybersecurity or safety vulnerabilities.</li>\r\n	<li>Reliability: The number of errors (bugs) in the program.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintainability: How easy it is for others to understand and take over.</li>\r\n	<li>Influence: Reputation and status in the community.</li>\r\n	<li>Contribution: Performance and evaluation in collaborating on projects with other engineers online.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-03/img-1711378814-14926.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"GitRoll system diagram\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitRoll system offers a total of five analytical dimensions, encompassing an emphasis on the core programming skills of security, reliability, and maintainability, as well as the evaluation of engineers\' personal soft skills such as influence and community contribution. / Image Credits: GitRoll官網</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to being able to scan individual engineer profiles, the GitRoll system also provides a feature to store scan results. By uniformly comparing the analysis results of applicants with different abilities, it helps to find the candidates that best meet the expectations of the enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the GitRoll system currently only provides assessments of programming abilities and does not fully evaluate soft skills such as communication and collaboration, Feng Ruei Guo shared that the system has sparked enthusiastic discussions within the engineering community since its launch. Not only do engineers actively express their wishes for future functionalities, but also when the team is busy with enterprise development, engineers in the community voluntarily request public code for corrections. \'Because everyone wants to \'play\' with it, it\'s fair to say that the GitRoll system is being driven forward by the engineers themselves,\' said Feng Ruei Guo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Becoming Alternative Global Talent Brokers: The Future Path of Startup GitRoll</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The GitRoll team, jokingly referring to themselves as \'alternative international human trafficker\', expressed their future plans to expand beyond building capability scanning systems and move towards the goal of \'engineer headhunting\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitRoll will gradually expand its community influence by launching an engineer database. When companies want to recruit engineers, they can directly search on GitRoll\'s website and filter according to the types of engineers they are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team has completed the setting of the screening mechanism algorithm and has been in contact with engineers from different fields to expand the system database. Since its launch in November 2023, the GitRoll system has accumulated data from 5,000 engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being established for less than half a year, the GitRoll team has learned from past entrepreneurial failures. They conducted market research after identifying market problems, confirming market size and product feasibility before delving into software development related to the field. Gradually, they have established a foothold in the relatively overlooked area of coding ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With clear corporate goals and a team of aligned members, the next step for the GitRoll team is to venture into the larger U.S. market, which has greater industry demand. They aspire to explore and unearth underrated and buried engineering talents within the Asian community, aiming to build a bridge for them to enter the international market and assist them in pursuing a future where \'abilities speak\'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original : Meet Global 〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48036\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48036</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2024-04-29 06:56:26', '2024-04-29 07:00:37', NULL),

The acquisition aims to bolster cybersecurity and foster collaboration in self-driving technology. Additionally, Kiwibot CEO Felipe Chavez (pictured left) revealed in an interview that they are planning to collaborate with renowned Taiwanese electronics manufacturers and shift the robot production supply chain from China to Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Self-Driving Lalamove, Born on Campus: Where Does the Delivery InfoSec Risk Arise?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, Kiwibot primarily provided small-scale delivery robot services in closed environments such as university campuses, making it similar to the self-driving version of Uber Eats or Lalamove within campuses. Revenue was mainly derived from delivery fees per order and advertisements displayed on the robots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwibot\'s robot fleet initially underwent trials at the University of California, Berkeley, continuously refining its sensors, radar, and other self-driving technologies to ensure the safety of autonomous driving on campus. Now, they have manufactured 500 robots, completed over 250,000 deliveries, and launched robot fleets on 30 university campuses across 18 states in the United States and 41 cities globally, including locations in the US, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia. Kiwibot has also decided to expand into spaces such as factories or offices in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-04/img-1713238569-76480.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Kiwibot\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwibot\'s self-driving delivery robots primarily operate in closed environments such as campuses. / Image Credits: Kiwibot Official Website</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Felipe Chavez\'s first entrepreneurial venture, Lulo, was also related to delivery services. As for why he chose campuses as the target market for his second venture, Felipe Chavez explained “We tried different target audiences and scenarios, and eventually concluded that campuses were the most suitable. In the United States, delivery services are quite expensive; ordering delivery on campuses is a luxury expense. Moreover, there is a shortage of delivery personnel, making it nearly impossible for students to use delivery services.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Felipe Chavez claims that because self-driving robots are connected to the internet and are equipped with multiple sensors and cloud services, along with the trend of sustainability, cybersecurity has become a focal point in Kiwibot\'s recent strategy and is also the key driver behind the merger with AUTO Mobility Solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is the Acquired AUTO Mobility Solutions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AUTO Mobility Solutions emerged as an independent entity from ALi Corporation\'s research and development department in 2022. It primarily focuses on developing technologies related to autonomous driving vehicles, indoor obstacle avoidance, robotics, and cybersecurity, along with associated chips. With over 100 patented technologies, this acquisition enables Kiwibot to not only benefit from these patented technologies but also strengthen its control over cybersecurity risks during delivery operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUTO Mobility Solutions CEO, Sming Liao, stated that this acquisition allows AUTO Mobility Solutions\'s technology to be applied in new and innovative ways. Felipe Chavez also mentioned that Kiwibot was originally a customer of AUTO Mobility Solutions, and the merger brings about significant synergies. AUTO Mobility Solutions contributes technological innovation and a portfolio of patents, enhancing Kiwibot\'s cybersecurity strength in AI robotics. Additionally, with operational teams in both Taipei and Shenzhen, AUTO Mobility Solutions\'s presence will help reduce Kiwibot\'s manufacturing and production costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-04/img-1713238559-73750.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Kiwibot acquires AUTO Mobility Solutions\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUTO Mobility Solutions CEO, Sming Liao (middle back), expressed anticipation for new business opportunities. / Image Credits: Kiwibot</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Kiwibot\'s Merger with AUTO Mobility Solutions: Embracing Global Trends and Unveiling Opportunities for Taiwanese Startups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwibot\'s consecutive acquisitions of Taiwanese startups and collaboration with electronic giants signal a strategic shift in production focus. The motives behind this move are worth pondering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang, who facilitated this acquisition, expressed that besides investing in startups, Headline Asia also aims to deepen collaboration among international startups. From a technological, cybersecurity, and production standpoint, this acquisition is a win-win situation. Considering the current international situation between China and the US, if Kiwibot\'s services intend to enter office spaces such as the US government or banks, they will inevitably have to undergo stricter cybersecurity risk assessments. Given the current supply chain risks, this might not be feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2022-01/img-1641445407-52424.jpeg?w=1200&amp;output=webp\" alt=\"Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang believes that cybersecurity is the most pressing issue for everyone right now, especially given the situation between China and the US. / Image Credits: AppWorks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Huang added that the current situation between China and the US has led more and more companies to relocate their supply chains from China to places like Vietnam and India. Taiwan can capitalize on this trend to step onto the international stage. \'Taiwanese startups possess excellent technology and talent, but often lack understanding of industry issues and usage scenarios. It\'s like having a hammer but not knowing where the nail is, and this is where our VC comes in to assist in solving.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Huang stated that in 2022, Kiwibot collaborated with one of the top three food service management companies in the US, Sodexo, to directly address distribution issues. This is a resource that AUTO Mobility Solutions found difficult to access directly. Therefore, through this acquisition, Taiwanese startup technology can have more room for development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Taiwan\'s merger and acquisition culture is not thriving, especially among enterprises. However, looking at the international market, Taiwan actually has many opportunities,\' Joseph Huang said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>〔Original : Meet Global 〕\r\n	<br><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48038\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48038</a></p>', NULL, 1, '2024-05-30 02:13:28', '2024-05-30 02:13:28', NULL),

This game-changing technology is set to transform business-customer interactions, bringing a whole new level of efficiency and personalized service to the forefront.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interaction with the Client : What Sets BEARVFX Apart from Competitors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>BEARVFX distinguishes itself by developing virtual humans capable of interacting not just through voice, but also by interpreting facial expressions. Ethan Cheng, CEO and co-founder, elaborates on their innovative approach, aiming to collaborate with restaurants and boutiques. \"For instance, in a clothing store, we can customize the avatar to showcase clothing available in the boutique. The background and appearance of the AI avatar can also be tailored,\" he explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1721374629884.jpeg\" alt=\"BEARVFX - AI Virtual Human Interface\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEARVFX - AI Virtual Human Interface / Image Credits: BEARVFX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We\'re looking to expand into various industries,\" Ethan continues. \"For instance, a perfume company approached us, questioning whether our virtual customer service should also include the sense of smell. Currently, it doesn\'t, but it\'s a future possibility. Virtual humans should eventually incorporate all five senses, but we\'re taking it step by step.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked why they prioritize creating highly realistic virtual customer service rather than opting for easier-to-design characters, Ethan Cheng explained, \"Human pursuit of beauty knows no bounds. While 2D animations are confined to cartoons, there\'s a general preference for realism and aesthetic appeal. Developing realistic virtual humans sets the stage for future 2D innovations. If we begin with 2D, transitioning to realistic designs later would be more challenging.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Will Emerging Technologies Shape the Future of Marketing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethan Cheng, CEO and co-founder of BEARVFX, studied EiMBA at National Taiwan University. Before founding BEARVFX and participated in an entrepreneurship competition. In 2018, he showcased his expertise in immersive visual experiences by assisting JJ Lin with concert projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1721374657179.jpeg\" alt=\"BEARVFX team members\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image Credits: BEARVFX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEARVFX not only creates virtual humans but also specializes in marketing technology. Pepper Hu, CEO and co-founder, highlights their strategic focus: \"We aim for natural interaction, not just through voice. Our goal is to create virtual beings that can see you now.

Due to privacy concerns, these AI virtual humans are designed not to remember customers\' faces.

For instance, if an important client enters the bank, the AI virtual human recognizes them and offers personalized greetings.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>BEARVFX is revolutionizing customer service with advanced virtual human technology. Envision a future where stepping into McDonald\'s means warmly interacting with a virtual assistant that seamlessly understands your needs and emotions, transforming the dining experience.

(651, 'Caught Sick in a Foreign Country? Ambii Transforms How You Access Healthcare Worldwide', '2024-08-19', '', '<p>Imagine you are a foreigner in Japan, and you suddenly need medical attention. You don\'t speak the language, you are unfamiliar with the healthcare system, and you have no idea where to turn. This scenario, all too common for expats and travelers, inspired the creation of Ambii, a startup that is revolutionizing how people access healthcare across borders. Founded in May 2018 by Yuki Taira and Yuji Schuster, Ambii is driven by a singular mission: to make healthcare accessible and seamless for everyone, no matter where they are or where they\'re from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea for Ambii was born from real-life experiences. Yuki Taira the co-founder and CEO, encountered these challenges firsthand when he moved to the United States for university. As a student in Wisconsin, he struggled with English and faced important difficulties when trying to access healthcare. He suffered of food poisoning that left him navigating multiple clinics, battling language barriers, and feeling isolated in a foreign land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuki Taira discussed about this problem with his international friends and realized taht a lot of them faced the same problem. These experiences created a seed of idea in his mind: a service that would bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers across linguistic and cultural divides.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Breaking Language Barriers: Ambii\'s Approach to Global Healthcare Access</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why Yuki Taira and Yuji Schuster launched Ambii, a platform designed to assist foreigners in accessing medical care while abroad, particularly if they face language barriers. It allows users to find and book appointments with doctors and offers customizable symptom questionnaires in 14 languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operating in Japan and Taiwan, Ambii streamlines the healthcare process by directly sharing these translated questionnaires with doctors, reducing paperwork and phone calls, and integrating the information into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for a smoother experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1724057493475.jpeg\" alt=\"Ambii website overlook\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website makes it simple to find nearby clinics with English-speaking doctors and see their available schedules. / Image Credits: Ambii website</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1724057494396.jpeg\" alt=\"Ambii phone interface\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambii provides chatbot services to help make accessing healthcare easier for everyone. / Image Credits: Ambii website</p>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48079\">\r\n\r\n	<h2>Ambii\'s Key Partnerships with Taiwanese Healthcare Providers</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Yuki Taira explains, “The system not only saves time but also helps doctors focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks.” This innovation has already seen significant success in Japan, where over 100,000 appointments have been made through Ambii. The startup has also expanded into Taiwan, partnering with clinics like Xin Ming Clinic （新明診所）, Dianthus MFM Clinic （禾馨婦產科）, and William\'s Clinic ( 康心美婦診所), and is in talks with 15 more clinics to extend their services further.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ambii’s business model is designed to be simple and patient-friendly. They charge residents a monthly fee and a one-time fee for each appointment, but the clinic covers these costs. This setup helps patients concentrate on their health without stressing over additional expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Operating in the healthcare industry is not easy, especially in a market as unique as Japan’s. Ambii faces the challenge of ensuring that the healthcare providers on their platform maintain high standards of care. To address this, Yuki Taira and his team work closely with clinics to understand their needs and rely on user feedback to continually improve their services.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Yuki Taira reflects on the cultural differences between Japan and Taiwan and notices “Clinics in Taiwan initially didn’t use questionnaires, but once they started, they quickly saw the benefits. The appointment system is quite similar to Japan’s, which made the transition easier.” This adaptability is key to Ambii’s strategy as they prepare to expand further into Taiwan and beyond.</p><img src=\"/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1724057533715.jpeg\" alt=\"Ambii questionnaire\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-result=\"success\" style=\"width: 900px;\"></div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48079\">Ambii\'s digital medical questionnaire is available in 14 languages and aims to eliminate communication barriers between foreign patients and medical professionals, reduce misunderstandings caused by language and culture, and help ensure proper medical examinations. / Image Credits: Ambii website</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48079\">\r\n	<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div data-aid=\"48079\">\r\n\r\n	<p>In a market where trust is key, Ambii is also considering introducing an \"Ambii Certificate\" for doctors who receive consistently positive feedback, helping to boost the credibility and reliability of their service.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Looking forward, Ambii plans to expand their services to include phone interpretation, so people can speak with doctors no matter the language. For now, they only offer services in Japanese in Taiwan, but they plan to launch an English service soon. Yuki Taira mentions, “Some people are very nervous about going to a clinic and don’t want to share their symptoms with friends, so they use translation apps, which isn’t convenient.”</p>\r\n\r\n	<h2>Healthcare for Everyone: How Ambii Breaks Down Barriers with Technology and Culture</h2>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ambii believes that healthcare should be easy for everyone, no matter their language, location, or background. Their slogan, “Healthcare for Everyone,” sums up this mission. By using technology, understanding different cultures, and focusing on patient care, Ambii is more than just a healthcare platform, it’s a helping hand for people dealing with the challenges of medical systems abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>As they continues to grow, their focus remains on expanding their services to new regions, improving user experience, and making healthcare as stress-free and accessible as possible. In a world where access to quality healthcare is often hindered by language and cultural barriers, Ambii is breaking down those walls, one appointment at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Ambii has already made strides in breaking down barriers to healthcare, but their mission doesn’t stop there. They remain committed to finding new ways to make healthcare more accessible, ensuring that more people can get the care they need, no matter where they are.</p>\r\n	<div data-sid=\"Meet_D_Article_bottom_video\">〔Original : Meet Global〕</div>\r\n	<div data-sid=\"Meet_D_Article_bottom_video\"><a href=\"https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48079\">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48079</a></div></div>', NULL, 1, '2024-08-19 08:53:04', '2024-08-19 08:53:04', NULL);

Once you download the app and join in as a member, the app provides a map identifying the scooters nearby and users can click ‘reservation’ to book their scooters,” Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>“After finishing your (ride), you just need to park the scooter at a ‘legal’ open-air parking area, “ Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>The app requires users not to park their scooters randomly, which helps to reduce parking congestion.</p>\r\n<p>After the rider successfully parks the scooter, he or she clicks “return the scooter” and pays online, Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>Wu told Business Next Media that he wants to make transportation a fun thing to do and wants to organize crossover cooperation with different brands, corporations and local governments.</p>\r\n<p>“We have cooperation with ‘Jimmy,’ a famous Taiwanese illustrator, who designs WeMo scooters to attract the young generation,” Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>WeMo’s users, particularly female ones, like to post scooters with his designs on social media, such as Instagram, Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>“We have to put our utmost effort into finding new things through strategic cooperation and partnerships to make transportation a fun thing,” Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s important to let our WeMo members truly feel it’s worthwhile to join WeMo as we offer different things,” Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>Wu still noted that technology plays the most important role in his business.</p>\r\n<p>“The technology team of WeMo Scooter has been engaging in upgrading our hardware,” Wu said.</p>\r\n<h2>WeMo’s Future Vision</h2>\r\n<p>Wu, a graduate of New York’s Columbia University, envisions his e-scooter system as a “bedrock” in building a “smart city,” an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information, which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.</p>\r\n<p>Wu, who has also worked for McKinsey and Intel, said he was inspired by speeches made on Columbia&#8217;s campus by technology and investment icons such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.</p>\r\n<p>“I still remembered well those giants’ wise words and how touched I was by their words, which led me become an entrepreneur who wishes to make something different and to create a social impact,&#8221; Wu said.</p>\r\n<p>As such, an environmentally-friendly “smart city” is his vision for the future.</p>\r\n<p>Once the public is broadly in the habit of using shared electric scooters, Wu says he may move into fields involving the collection of air pollution statistics and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>“Everything involved requires to have a lot of internet-of-things (technologies) to realize this vision, and that’s the next thing I would like to do,” Wu concluded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44615\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44615</a></p>\r\n					', './img/789.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Along with their wives, they founded the Kuo Brothers Group.</p>\r\n<p>The group had previously created various online businesses.</p>\r\n<p>One of their more well known ones was Atlaspost.com, which was founded in 2007 and has since closed. It was a social mapping service that helped travelers to connect with people in their vicinity and share content with others all over the world. Later, the website was acquired by America’s Groupon.</p>\r\n<p>His rich experience of running Atlaspost.com helped Kuo to begin thinking about future online business models for Pcone.</p>\r\n<p>Kuo said he had been very flexible in adopting various business models for Pcone and this had contributed to the firm’s success. He was willing to try out anything but would immediately stop adopting a model once it turned out not to be of help for the company.</p>\r\n<p>“I think the advantage that we have is … that our team members are from the younger generation,” Kuo said.</p>\r\n<p>“So as the junior (company), we can mirror the experiences of the senior ones,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Kuo noted that younger firms don’t need to copy everything the older companies do.</p>\r\n<p>“Many e-commerce platforms announced ambitious plans to expand their markets overseas, however, we don’t have these plans since our market is focused on Taiwan,” Kuo said.</p>\r\n<p>Kuo also says his business strategies relating to stock keeping units play a big part in staying ahead of the competition.</p>\r\n<p>A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased on an e-commerce website. The purpose of SKUs is to help a company to systematically track its product availability in warehouses.</p>\r\n<p>Kuo said that Pcone focuses on amassing SKU’s relating to popular lifestyle products, rather than offering SKUs for all product categories as e-commerce companies normally do.</p>\r\n<p>Kuo offers the following advice for would-be entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n<p>“Once you find out a solution is not the one you are looking for, then just drop it and try the next.</p>\r\n<p>“You know you will be getting closer to success.”</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44599</a></p>\r\n					', './img/456.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

We understand how difficult that is and wanted to change the environment for the country’s film industry.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The SELF project plans to increase funding success and build an audience around a film project, even before shooting of a film starts, by creating what its marketers call an immersive entertainment digital asset that integrates virtuality and reality.</p>\r\n<p>“The film production’s movie scripts, movie budget and other information will now be released to allow fans to support the film projects they like,” explained Hsu.</p>\r\n<p>Moviegoers and fans will be able to use the SELF tokens to exchange movie tickets, or exchange it for food and drink products at their partnered restaurants and bars in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Hsu added that each time a customer spends SELF tokens he or she gets bonuses and points. This type of engagement with moviegoers shows it is possible to create a positive cycle where aspiring filmmakers receive direct funds from their audiences.</p>\r\n<p>“It offers moviegoers a new way of supporting the movies they love,” Hsu said.</p>\r\n<p>Hsu is testing the SELF project through kickstarting Asia’s first blockchain movie, a film project entitled “The Last Thieves.”</p>\r\n<p>“If the saints don’t die, the thieves won’t stop,” is the slogan of the upcoming film. The film will start shooting in October and is expected to release in the first quarter of next year.</p>\r\n<p>Customers will be able to buy 100 SELF tokens in exchange for one movie ticket which will be available for movie theatres in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The price for SELF token sales is expected to be NT$2.5 for each SELF token.</p>\r\n<p>The SELF team plan to add an interactive game element in the film through use of mobile apps and the internet allowing users and buyers of the SELF tokens to have their own virtual characters in the movie. For instance, if you go to the movie alone, then your character and its outfit may turn into a persona of a lone wolf.</p>\r\n<p>Immersive entertainment has been the project’s core concept.

But conventional methods of detection miss some of the telltale clogs in the brain.</p>\r\n<p>Taiwanese medical technology startup <a title=\"http://www.neurobittech.com\" href=\"http://www.neurobittech.com/\">Neurobit</a> developed Neurospeed in July of 2017 to detect strokes by reading eyeball movement. The company leaders believe this method to be quick and more reliable than the scans typically used today.</p>\r\n<p>Neurospeed is a cranial nerve examination device that analyses involuntary eye movement. Analysis of eye movement can tell within one minute whether someone is showing stroke symptoms, according to a 2013 medical journal report. By 2015 a John Hopkins Hospital neurologist had designed a technique to read eyes for strokes.</p>\r\n<p>The Neurospeed device uses those movements to measure the stability of a patient’s vision. It checks rapid head rotation and looks for any signs of skew deviation, an abnormality when eyeballs are not completely aligned when moving.</p>\r\n<p>This process can sense 90% of stroke-related abnormalities in the brain, Neurobit Chief Executive Travis Yi told Business Next.</p>\r\n<p>CT scans and MRIs are the two most widely used methods for examining strokes today.</p>\r\n<h2>Market for the device</h2>\r\n<p>The company anticipates a product launch next year, followed by a final push for funding as they visit the United States, a major target market, periodically to meet local doctors for feedback.</p>\r\n<p>Neurobit’s founders plan to develop a range of devices that embed the technology for faster screenings. The device will be able to screen for strokes at emergency scenes and in hospitals as well as aboard ambulances.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually consumers may be able to get the devices themselves, including in rural areas. This level of access would help people at risk of strokes do self-checkups.</p>\r\n<h2>A team of students</h2>\r\n<p>Most of the Neurobit founders are students. Chief Technology Officer and the youngest co-founder Jim Huang finished grad school at National Taiwan University, where he researched medical engineering after majoring in biotechnology.</p>\r\n<p>“As students, we only lack experience in linking up with industry,” co-founder Wang Jing-fu said. Neurobit has not yet raised funds, Wang told Business Next, so the founders must solve every issue themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Roger Chen, the only co-founder with industry experience, looks after finances and operations, adding the firm needs greater business finesse to overcome the lack of integration in upstream and downstream medical equipment.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43574</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070912-5.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

It is the name the business is best known by in Taiwan. With renowned clients like Yung Ching Rehouse Company, they are already cementing their place in the sector.</p>\r\n<p>iStaging’s strategy is to win over the giants of the housing market, Lee said.</p>\r\n<p>He added the solutions they offer are popular among Taiwan’s biggest realtors because the adoption of new technology enhances their image. Lee added that they also have the funds to invest in new equipment.</p>\r\n<p>On top of this, Lee said, through their close collaboration with housing’s big players, iStaging can gain a better understanding of how to best position themselves to take advantage of the industry’s future trends.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, confining itself purely to the real estate sector could limit the company’s potential growth and real estate is not the only industry iStaging has set its sights on.</p>\r\n<p>In future it will not develop hardware or create content, Lee said, and instead develop platforms using technologies that can be used by other industries across the world.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43512\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43512</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070827.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

He came to show a prototype of his microphone at a display curated by Taiwan-based <a title=\"http://www.epoch.org.tw/en\" href=\"http://www.epoch.org.tw/en\">Epoch Foundation</a>’s incubation initiative Garage+ Startup Global Program.</p>\r\n<p>The year-old Soundskrit is using sound velocity readings – inspired by the way insects communicate – to design microphone chips for consumer electronics. The chips may be able to recognize speech to a point where the host device can tell who’s talking at a crowded event.</p>\r\n<p>This Q&amp;A with Gupta explains Soundskrit’s origins and plans:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Tell us a bit about yourself and about your role at Soundskrit.</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: I got my bachelor’s and master’s degree in electrical and computer Engineering at Cornell University in upstate New York. I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I ended up joining two accelerators prior to joining Soudskrit.</p>\r\n<p>When TandemLaunch, an incubator in Montreal, gave me an offer to join a new project which is now known as Soundskrit, I was very excited. I moved to Montreal from New York and became part of the Soundskrit team. The company was founded in September last year. We currently have a team of four.</p>\r\n<p>Iman Moazzen, who is also with us today, is the cofounder and software lead; Stephane Leahy is the cofounder and hardware lead, and we have a fourth member, Ahmed Abdelaziz from the University of Waterloo, who is in charge of our production.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What are your featured products?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: Soundskrit is a Montreal-based tech startup focusing on developing a velocity-based directional microphone to improve speech recognition and sound recording in smart devices.</p>\r\n<p>Professor Ron Miles at Binghamton University in New York has spent many years of research studying the auditory systems of many small insects. What he found was that a lot of insects are actually measuring the velocity of the sound rather than the pressure. Inspired by that idea, he came up with this concept to measure sound in a directional manner.</p>\r\n<p>He invented the core intellectual property of the design of what’s inside the microphone—this idea of how we can make up microphone to pick up the direction of the sound with very good response. We’re taking that as our core concept and building on top of it and trying to commercialize it into a device. We’re looking at applications like video conferencing, virtual conferencing and taking meeting minutes. For example, if you want to take meeting minutes in a conference room, you can imagine using it to track who’s saying what based on where they’re sitting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What’s next for Soundskrit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: We raised an 800,000 Canadian dollar seed round in December last year. It’s a seed fund raised from TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based incubator that focuses on commercializing research. We’re currently working on our proof of concept process as we’re still in early stages.</p>\r\n<p>By the end of this year, we will have our MEMS (Micro Electrical-Mechanical System) chip on a smaller scale. We will continue to work on our product development, in particular the design of microphone’s mechanical structure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Do you plan to contract with Taiwanese companies in the future?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A: We’re here in Taiwan because we’re seeing a lot of potential to work with Taiwanese companies. I think Taiwan has a lot of strong companies in manufacturing as well as in personal computer industries. One of the applications we&#8217;re looking at is PCs and laptops.</p>\r\n<p>We think Taiwan is a perfect place for us to understand the current solutions and the current limitations of computer hardware. Thanks to the support from Garage+ Startup Global Program, we have a chance to meet with some of the directors and company executives of professional Taiwanese computer makers like Quanta Computer. It’s great for us because eventually we want to embed our chips into a laptop or a hardware device.</p>\r\n<p>We’re visiting Taiwan for the first time and it’s been an extraordinary experience because you get to have first-hand information of Taiwan’s computer industry.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43181</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070706-8.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

What are some of the opportunities that you’re looking for?</h2>\r\n<p>A: The reason we’ve been very interested in coming to Taiwan is that many of the people making the sensors, including the camera sensors, the video sensors, are Taiwanese companies. So, I think our next office outside of Canada is probably going to be in Taiwan. Our whole focus is making millions and millions of devices smart.</p>\r\n<p>We don’t want to just make a few devices smart for a very high price. We realized that if we want to make these millions of devices, we would have to work with Taiwanese companies so that we can design it and manufacture it.</p>\r\n<p>Through the Garage+ Startup Global program, we’ve been introduced to Quanta Computer, (power supply maker) Delta Electronics and many other key players in Taiwan’s ICT industry. The chances are we’re going to be working closely with all of the companies we met as OEM/ODM contractors.</p>\r\n<p>I think if it goes well with the companies that we’re talking with, we’d like to have people in Taipei so that we have support on the ground floor.</p>\r\n<h2>Q: How much money have you raised so far?</h2>\r\n<p>A: We raised a small amount of money when we first set the company up. The funds came from big companies in India, which our business contacts introduced to us. We’re waiting now until the end of this trip. We’ve got a number of different projects and now we’re going to look at a much larger funding this year.</p>\r\n<h2>Q: Many software companies are working on AI as well, and they compete to hire top engineering talent. Do you think you have an advantage in recruiting?</h2>\r\n<p>A: I’d say we’ve been very lucky with talents. Right now, we have 10 people on the team. We have two groups of people. We have a core group of people who are Ph.D., post-doctorate fellows, artificial intelligence experts who are designing the core algorithms. And then we have another group of people who are embedded programmers, writing C++ embedded real-time applications.</p>\r\n<p>Our access to talents has been very good. I think cities in Canada are becoming a magnet for top international product and engineering talent. Also, (in Canada) we have University of Montréal, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and those three universities have very strong computer science departments.</p>\r\n<h2>Q: What’s next for Invision AI?</h2>\r\n<p>A: Our products are still underdevelopment, so we’ll continue our work in product development. For our technologies in people recognition and face recognition, we want to make those available at a very low cost to the camera manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p>The idea is that they will be able to put it on every device they ship. We’re seeing a lot of potential in Asia. We think there’s a lot of opportunities in mainland China, in terms of video surveillance, securities, and smart cities. And we’re excited that Taiwan is going to be an important business partner to take our business to the next level.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43139</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070704-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

That delivery speed is unusually fast, a boon to standing out among competitors.</p>\r\n<p>The company says in a report that it aims to grow in Taiwan and reach into Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. It expects to expand in the United States, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Giftpack started service in May in Sydney and the city of Taoyuan in northern Taiwan. It’s also available in the Taiwan cities of Kaohsiung, Taichung and Tainan. Other parts of Taiwan will be covered over the next few months.</p>\r\n<p>The company lets online shoppers receive products from local merchants within three hours of a purchase. Shoppers can use an iOS app in Chinese, English and Japanese to find items for gifting. They pay by credit card.</p>\r\n<p>The app download page says shoppers may also add personalized text, video or voice messages, voice or video messages to their gifts.</p>\r\n<p>The service’s seven-person staff works with 120 on-demand contract packers to make deliveries go smoothly.</p>\r\n<h2>The back story</h2>\r\n<p>According to the company website, the founders began planning two years ago. They first delivered Starbucks coffee to friends and family in San Francisco and Taipei.</p>\r\n<p>Giftpack’s co-founder is Archer Chiang. The 26-year-old Taiwanese man, now the Giftpack CEO, graduated from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Chiang previously received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>The cross-border gifting idea was first tested in China with a small-scale coffee delivery service for Chinese hostels, Chiang said. Chiang believed that test to be successful and decided to try it in San Francisco as he was based there.</p>\r\n<p>“Finding your startup’s product market fit is the most important step,” said Chiang <a title=\"https://www.appcoda.com.tw/giftpack-interview/\" href=\"https://www.appcoda.com.tw/giftpack-interview/\">in a report.</a></p>\r\n<p>Giftpack found it sometimes got overwhelmed by orders in San Francisco and had to outsource some deliveries to a rival in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>But the startup is vying in a crowded field of e-commerce and delivery services. It faces competition from major names such as GrubHub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash in the United States. E-retailers such as PChome Online and Shopee will vie with it in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>PCHome says it can deliver within six hours in Taipei. Another player, Momo, now guarantees 12-hour deliveries in cities in northern Taiwan. But Giftpack’s number of gifts lags those of its peers.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this year, Giftpack opened a pop-up store inside the Taipei shopping center Q Square to complement its online presence. Shoppers can see and touch products such as candles, photo frames and dried flower bouquets.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43002\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/43002</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070607-1.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),
(10, 'These Taiwanese Entrepreneurs Turned Wine Drinking into an Internationally Popular App', '2018-05-16', 'interviews', '<p>Having a glass of wine is a common ritual, especially in Western countries. However, not everyone who drinks wine knows how to catalogue all the bottles they might mass in their cellars.</p>\r\n<p>Now a Taipei-based startup is mixing wine and mobile software with app called <a title=\"http://cell.wine\" href=\"http://cell.wine/\">CellWine</a> to help collectors sort out their stash with the possibility of making friends in the process.</p>\r\n<p>The app that helps people keep track of their reds, whites and roses has been downloaded more than 40,000 times since its launch in June 2017. France is the top download destination followed by Italy. CellWine app ranks among France’s top 100 apps.</p>\r\n<p>CellWine has received a patent for its work in Taiwan and United States as well.</p>\r\n<p>Mario Fang and Eric Tang founded CellWine. The two Taiwanese entrepreneurs talked to Business Next about how they started it.</p>\r\n<h2>A work interlude followed by comics and a thing for wine</h2>\r\n<p>Fang first founded a public relations firm at age 28 and later sold it to a French company. He pondered his next move until last year.</p>\r\n<p>“I wanted to do something different, and the other reason I want to keep working is that as a father, I want to set a good example for my kid that you have to do something creative for fulfilling your life,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>He eventually read the Japanese comic book series Drops of God, which mentions red wine. Fang from there onward become a loyal fan of the drink and began to collect bottles of it from other countries.</p>\r\n<p>“There is a common problem for wine lovers,” he said. “The more (bottles of wine) you buy, the more you would easily forget where they are.”</p>\r\n<p>Wine collectors usually sort bottles in some order to remember what’s in them or rent a cellar away from home, Fang said.</p>\r\n<p>“But, could we invent a solution to make it easier?” he recalls thinking. So he shared his ideas with Tang, a software engineer who has made more than 20 apps.</p>\r\n<p>“At the very first, Mario just wanted to design this app for himself to manage those bottles of wine,” Tang said. “But I sensed there is a big chance that we could do it for reaching global market.” It was that discussion that birthed the idea of CellWine together as business.</p>\r\n<h2>International following</h2>\r\n<p>CellWine is intended to help wine drinkers manage the detail of every bottle they buy. It records the date of purchase and location of storage, for example. Some wines become more valuable as they age. These data points help collectors to know how valuable each bottle is.</p>\r\n<p>The app’s label identification system requires that users aim their phone camera at a bottle without taking a photo. This function lets users take down information such as the wine’s origin, price and grape variety. Users can also see through the app who else has bought the same type of wine, offering them potential social connections.</p>\r\n<p>“We have gotten much feedback from French users, and actually we are very surprised this app has been widely used in France since we did only little advertising on Google keywords on this giant search engine,” Fang said.</p>\r\n<p>The wine research and information website <a title=\"https://wineblots.com/about-us\" href=\"https://wineblots.com/about-us\">WineBlot</a>, has praised CellWine as one of its <a title=\"https://wineblots.com/wine-lifestyle/top-5-wine-apps-for-wine-lovers\" href=\"https://wineblots.com/wine-lifestyle/top-5-wine-apps-for-wine-lovers\">“Top 5 Wine App for Wine Lovers”.</a> The website calls it “simple to use.”</p>\r\n<p>The founders now plan to expand into the U.S. and Japanese markets this year and work toward an initial public offering.</p>\r\n<p>“Now we have registered an office in United State since the USA actually is the top one wine consumption country, and we are planning to cooperate with local partners to launch a whole new thing for our users,” Tang said. One idea is to add e-commerce to the app, he said.</p>\r\n<p>The founders did not give financial data for their app, which has competitors offshore.</p>\r\n<h2>Trust in the face of discouragement</h2>\r\n<p>CellWine worked as a business largely because the two founders trusted each other through mutual friends, Tang said. They have worked on the app for two years.</p>\r\n<p>“There are plenty of problems we encountered when we started to run a startup,” he said. “But Mario and I trust each other. Once there is a problem that shows up, we just sit down and talk since our goal is the same – to make CellWine better and better.”</p>\r\n<p>Among the barriers to starting up was discouraging feedback.</p>\r\n<p>“I am a person who loves to share things with people I’ve met,” Fang said. “I remembered that sometimes I had told people about my idea of making the CellWine app and its function. Some people would encourage me, but indeed there were a few people said there is no need to use for this app since they prefer to take notes to remind themselves (about wine) or some people might ask their own secretaries to remember where the expensive bottles of wine are.</p>\r\n<p>“I do feel frustrated when I’ve hear this negative feedbacks, but I would tell myself that I trust what I am doing now with my partner Eric,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>The duo is now exploring chances to go overseas for exhibitions to learn more about markets and startup ecosystems outside Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>“Startups always need sources to support, and the culture of the startup ecosystem in Taiwan is still in its development,” Tang said. “Therefore, we spent our own budget to join different exhibitions…and did gain some chances to meet potential partners and investors. I think this is a good investment for us, too.”</p>\r\n<p>To promote CellWine overseas, the founders attended <a title=\"https://riseconf.com\" href=\"https://riseconf.com/\">RISE Hong Kong 2017</a> and <a title=\"https://websummit.com\" href=\"https://websummit.com/\">WebSummit 2017.</a>This year it will join <a title=\"https://collisionconf.com\" href=\"https://collisionconf.com/\">Collision</a> in the United States in the final week of April with Taiwan Startup Stadium, a government-supported organization to help Taiwanese startups expand overseas.</p>\r\n<p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<a href=\"https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42796</a></p>\r\n					', './img/1070516-3.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

It gradually developed a cohort of local designers and now arranges sales of more than 500 Thai brands.</p>\r\n<p>Cofounder and Chief Executive Peter Yen said in an interview that growth accelerated solidly after about 100 Thai brands had signed on. That momentum enabled Pinkoi to start increasing cross-border operations in 2016, leading to steep growth last year.</p>\r\n<p>The company has also entered Malaysia and now has its sights on China.</p>\r\n<p>Pinkoi has no plans to open a China office, but Yen said the firm will hold a Pinkoi Market fair, an event which showcases the platform’s products, in May in Guangzhou.</p>\r\n<p>Pinkoi has worked with DHL, FedEx and local delivery companies over the past two years to raise the transparency of logistics operations, Yen said.</p>\r\n<p>Customers care less about delivery speed than knowing which phase of delivery an item is in, so Pinkoi tries to offer them a sense of security.</p>\r\n<h2>Buyer-seller interface</h2>\r\n<p>Pinkoi and its sellers have cut the time needed from receiving an order to shipping it by 30%. Customers are happier and sellers more efficient, Yen said.</p>\r\n<p>Mobile transactions already take up 77% of Pinkoi’s total in China and Japan, and over 60% in both Taiwan and Thailand. Pinkoi has accordingly adjusted the backend management of vendors as well as consumer interface procedures to suit mobile phone users.</p>\r\n<p>The ecommerce platform will also bolster direct contact between buyers and sellers, extending an evaluation system that’s in place already. Pinkoi’s reach of 88 countries raises the need for communication channels that build understanding between sellers and consumers from different countries to make purchase decisions easier, Yen said.</p>\r\n<p>Increasing cross-border transactions is paramount, the chief officer said.

The system is built to help surgeons come up with a surgery plan based on pre-operative imagery, including MRI scans of internal body structures.</p>\r\n<p>A deep-brain surgical procedure for implanting electrodes that stimulate areas in the brain normally takes over eight hours to complete the procedure. The Brain Navi system cuts that time to less than eight minutes and reduces the time patients spend under anesthesia, Chen said.</p>\r\n<p>“Brain Navi Surgical Navigation System provides clear and precise guidance for doctors and minimizes the loss of normal brain tissues,” Chen said in a YouTube video posted in August 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Chen said in a report that the Brain Navi system can particularly help surgeons do robotic surgery for Parkinson’s disease. The Brain Navi surgical robot can be used to help place electrodes in the brain to provide deep brain stimulation.</p>\r\n<p>The company faces competition from international players such as Intuitive Surgical, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medtronic. Brain Navi expects its system to help meet a growing demand and be among the best technologically.</p>\r\n<p>The system is not in use yet. It is undergoing tests for approval in Taiwan, the United States, and Europe. The firm will eventually seek regulatory approval, including from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.</p>\r\n<p>Brain Navi announced in a Facebook post that TechCrunch Disrupt had picked its surgical navigation system and robotic arms to be shown on September 5-7 in San Francisco.</p>\r\n<p>Chen is also director of urology at China Medical University’s Beigang Hospital in Beigang in Taiwan and a biomedical engineering researcher.

Furthermore, the sound legal environment provides excellent protection for entrepreneurs about intellectual property and foreign investment, and strong IT cluster with numerous global leading brands draws a lot of foreigners trying to build their own company in Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>There are two entrepreneurs from French who wanted to set up a marketing company got a lot of help in the beginning with Taiwan’s entrepreneur visa and eventually successfully began their career in Taiwan with the company Pineapple Website Design.</p>\r\n<p>Julien Ferard and Maxime Lefevre, two young men from France set up their own company Pineapple Web Design two years ago. Julien Ferard has studied in National Taiwan University for one year as an exchange student about 6 years ago, and afterwards, he would like to stay and tried to find a job in Taiwan. After working in a company for 4 years, Ferard decided to open a new company. As for Maxime Lefevre, he took a trip to Taiwan for a month as a backpacker, and also loved the culture here, wanting live here after that. Lefevre got hired in the same company that Ferard did in Taiwan, so that was how they met and then decided to set up a company together.</p>\r\n<p>You might wonder why pineapple, why did they choose pineapple as the brand logo? “It’s because in Taiwanese and in Cantonese it means prosperity coming or prosperity arrives,” Ferard explained.  Ferard and Lefevre think the graphics of the pineapple is quite sophisticated, so it’s really easy to make some designs and advertisements with the pineapple, and it’s also easy for clients to remember.</p>\r\n<p>Both of them agree that’s tough for foreigners to set up a business in Taiwan, and the biggest difficulties might be getting the information since most of the information for opening a company is in Chinese, and the English access is really hard to retrieve. “But of course the entrepreneur visa for us is a big opportunity to set up a business in Taiwan, because we don’t need that much capital to start the company, we actually need much lower capital than if we didn’t have it.  And there’s still the turnover that we are required to have, it’s much lower than if we had a normal company.”Ferard noted that with the visa, it became easier for a startup to deal with the capital required in the beginning.</p>\r\n<p>Besides finance, with entrepreneur visa, setting up for foreign entrepreneurs in Taiwan becomes much easier. First, there is no need for entrepreneurs to set up a business before applying the visa.What’s more convenient is that with the visa, foreign entrepreneurs get residency for 1 year with unlimited entry, and able to extend visa without leaving Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Now, there are about 6 Taiwanese companies delegating Pineapple Web Design to design the English website. Most of them are hotels or restaurants which requires English access to reservations or promotion for tourists from different countries. They are also surprised that some big companies didn’t really manage well the website or there is even nobody in charge of the website work. However, he also mentioned that some hotels are happy to see some people like them come in with some solutions for them, so that they can get out of this cycle with Booking.com and those other platforms. “So I think we got a great welcome with that, with the hotel industry. We are creating solutions for them, and I think that was a great experience.”</p>\r\n<p>Besides those international hotels and restaurants, Pineapple Web. Design is trying to provide cheap website service to make it accessible for small business. Since Facebook is talking about closing business pages, and all those restaurants, all those bars and clubs, their biggest communication channel is Facebook, they will need something else. Furthermore, they are still working on the website that will be called Taiwan Tourism for offering civil service for foreigners that come to Taiwan to do some rafting, some hiking, some restaurants, some Taipei 101 visits, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Julien Ferard and Maxime Lefevre appreciated the convenience staying in Taiwan with the Entrepreneur Visa, and also appreciated the assistance from FutureWard to help them break the obstacle of Taiwanese culture.

The fact that foreigners want to build their own career in Taiwan is no longer an impossible mission, becauseTaiwan’s Entrepreneurs Visa has been released since 2015.  The simple process and few requests of Taiwan’s Entrepreneurs Visa draw more and more foreigners to chase their dream. Kevin Wolkober, with the special visa, built a brand-new app in 2016 to introduce Taiwan to the whole world.</p>\r\n<p>Sitting at the center of the Asia Pacific region, it is easy for entrepreneurs in Taiwan to travel both domestically and internationally with airports and amazing public transpotation systems.  Besides, Taiwan has a large and highly educated workforce pool which is especially abundant with R&amp;D talent. Combining above factors and many other wonderful conditions, Taiwan is definitely a great place to set up an intruding app “like Eat Drink Taiwan”.</p>\r\n<p>Kevin Wolkober first became interested in Taiwan through some Taiwanese friends he made while working in New York in 2008.  With all the good things they had to say about their homeland, and the fact of never having been abroad before, he became more and more interested in experiencing it for himself.  By 2011, his curiosity could be held back no longer &#8211; he visited Taiwan, and quickly came to love the environment and culture.  After three years of travelling back and forth between the two, he realized that the image of Taiwan through other Westerner’s eyes was not the same Taiwan he was seeing for himself, and decided to do something about it.</p>\r\n<p>“Because my background is in writing software, I wanted to use my own abilities to help introduce Taiwan to outsiders.”  He easily identified a universal want for potential users: good food.  And thus, Eat Drink Taiwan was born.  Wolkober intends for this app to act as a substitute for a local guide, introducing the foreigner to real Taiwanese cuisine.  “If you can’t speak Chinese, you can use these kind of simple tools to help you order food yourself&#8230;it doesn’t matter if you are local or foreign, we all need these tools to create that cultural bridge and get to know one another.”</p>\r\n<p>Like many other foreign business owners today, Wolkober is in Taiwan under the Entrepreneur Visa. He figured it out with the help of FutureWard, a coworking space here in Taipei, and says the biggest advantage of the Entrepreneur Visa is the residency card, which allows him to stay in Taiwan longer and develop new products.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, with the Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa, innovative entrepreneurs even don&#8217;t have to build an enterprise first, and get a residency for 1 year with unlimited entry.   Moreover, the visa can be extended up to 2 years without leaving Taiwan, and if residing in Taiwan for 5 years, entrepreneurs are able to apply for permanent residence.  With the visa, Wolkober no longer needs to travel back and forth between Taiwan and the U.S. Instead, getting residency for long makes him more concentrate on the development of app and also on Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Eat Drink Taiwan has been available on the App Store for more than two years now, with popularity on the rise.  Wolkober intends to continue adding more information to it, hopes to keep gaining viewers, and is open to collaborating with other travel companies in the future.</p>\r\n					', './img/kevin-1080x675.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Now an entrepreneur in Taiwan hopes to change that routine by sending packages of high-end leaves abroad via e-commerce.</p>\r\n<p>Laura Lu founded <a title=\"http://www.levertthe.com/en/home.aspx\" href=\"http://www.levertthe.com/en/home.aspx\">Le Vert Thé</a> five years ago to interest the global market in local teas.

But few people know Taiwan has this locale or that it’s known for tea. Lu also habitually drinks tea, so she wants to make more people to know about its flavor as well as its origins.</p>\r\n<p>Tea was introduced to Taiwan from nearby Fujian province in China in the 1700s.

Some specialty shops, as well as Starbucks, also make a point of serving Taiwanese tea.</p>\r\n<p>Lu hopes to merge tea and Taiwanese brewing culture through her sales.</p>\r\n<p>“The essence of drinking a good cup of tea is from its quality, and how you brew it also matters a lot,” she told Business Next Media.</p>\r\n<h2>Entrepreneur’s story</h2>\r\n<p>Lu, as a interior designer herself, uses her old talent to design Le Vert Thé ’s tealeaf boxes with a look that she describes as simple beauty.</p>\r\n<p>She uses eco-friendly packaging for every item and avoids packaging waste.</p>\r\n<p>As for what’s inside each box, Lu uses her connections with local tea growers to pick every type of tea herself with an eye toward quality.</p>\r\n<p>Le Vert The began selling tea to friends and family when the brand was first founded and eventually moved into e-commerce. Customers order it now straight from the vendor’s official website. They come from places as far flung as Australia and Denmark, Lu said.</p>\r\n<p>“After buying our tea first time, now, (customers from Australia and Denmark) become the regular customers to purchase the tea, which shows our quality of tea is consistent,” Lu said.</p>\r\n<p>As her reputation spread, the Eslite mall chain in Taiwan asked Le Vert Thé to open a store inside a branch in Taipei.

Hailed by many as a quasi-revolutionary revision of Taiwan’s labor law, the act is expected to open the door for foreign talent beginning next year. In the long run, it is hoped that it will infuse Taiwan’s economy with creativity and the means to remain competitive on the global market.</p>\r\n<p>One of the act’s main advocates is “serial entrepreneur” Ping Chu. Here the Harvard-educated entrepreneur shares his thoughts on the importance of internationalizing Taiwan’s workforce, as well as some of the challenges this entails.</p>\r\n<p>Following plenty of successful enterprises, Chu founded the Canmeng Institute in 2008 and the “Ripplemaker Foundation” in 2010, both of which aim to support young entrepreneurs. Additionally, he is the author of Businessmaker, Daymaker, Ripplemaker, where he outlines the core philosophy underpinning the great variety of businesses he was and still is involved in.</p>\r\n<p>Partially due to his academic upbringing overseas, partially thanks to his easy-going and adventurous personality, Chu over the course of time has built lasting friendships with people from all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>At his Red Room, a venue for artists to display their works or read poetry, individuals from different cultures mingle. For Chu, the Red Room is a way of connecting international artists to Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>“I don’t pay for them to produce art. Rather, I simply provide them with a space where they can work together and inspire each other. In the end, many artists and friends really want to stay in Taiwan.”</p>\r\n<p>This is even more surprising since average salaries in Taiwan are still exceptionally low for the most part, while visa requirements at the same time put unnecessary obstacles in the way of foreigners wishing to work. Yet Chu says that Taiwan and its liberal culture help balance out the disadvantages of the conservative labor market.</p>\r\n<p>Many of his foreign friends adore the lifestyle and friendships with locals, and he expects that many more will decide to stay once the recently passed act bears fruit.</p>\r\n<p>Chu is aware that the act is not only met with support, but has also engendered a fair share of criticism. To be sure, many approve of it and argue that having more foreign professional will assist Taiwan’s economy to become more competitive.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, however, others worry that it will undermine job opportunities for locals.</p>\r\n<p>“Hiring a foreign professional needs a certain budget, which usually can only be afforded and rendered feasible by certain industries such as finance, pharmaceutics, or the tech sector,” Chu believes that the act would not result in rising unemployment among locals as foreigners would not compete for the jobs that local can do. Rather, a more competitive economy will create more local job opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, Chu hopes that the act will succeed in attracting well-educated foreign talent and benefit the island nation economically and culturally.</p>\r\n<p>With the legal framework finally being revised, a more welcoming working and living environment for foreigners should emerge over the next decade. Combined with Taiwan’s many other advantages, the introduction of an internationalized job market could do wonders for the nation’s development.</p>\r\n<p>〔<strong>Original :Meet Startup @TW</strong>〕</p>\r\n					', './img/1070116.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', NULL, NULL),

Much of the biopharma establishment has neglected to fully understand the mechanisms at work in the disease of cancer. Aiming to bridge these gaps, Johnpro uses a multi-modality approach to treating cancer. Founded by an oncology doctor with 30+ years of clinical experience with a group of dedicated researchers, our team has used an understanding of the disease and the patient, to develop breakthroughs in drugs and cell therapy. We have a core belief that better patient care and cures can be unlocked through boundless learning and persistent innovation.</p>\r\n<p>By means of vigilant clinical observation, keenness to patient needs, and the discernment of feedback, Johnpro is developing methods that can be applied to future oncology therapy, without ignoring the needs of patients facing cancer today. Research into biochemistry and immunology has been the basis of the major developmental directions of the company: drug repurposing through the 505(b)(2) initiative, and cell therapy. For our efforts, we have been granted national awards and international patents for pioneering technology.</p>\r\n<p>As we strive for the Cure, we have built a R&amp;D team with roots in clinical practice.</p>\r\n<p>These collective experiences have allowed us to develop proprietary in-house  technologies and methods while adhering to time and budget controls. Developed  via applied medicine, each innovation is the result of consideration for the patient, patient-family, and practitioner. Physical tolerance, lifestyle maintenance, clinical application, and financial feasibility are taken into account through every step of development. Our philosophy is that the equation for oncology development, in the end, must equate to patient benefit.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Science in Mind, Humanity at Heart.</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Johnpro utilizes repurposed drugs to control the tumor microenvironment and cell-metabolism in developing new drug applications. Experiences in clinical patientcare has allowed us to reverse-engineer the approach and processes to cancer therapy. With a global perspective on drug development, our platforms enable us to collaborate our research with the international biopharmaceutical establishment, realizing returns on a global scale.</p>\r\n<p>Led by our founder, our R&amp;D team has the capability of endogenous innovation, resulting in proprietary patents. Comprehensive experience in applied clinical oncology has allowed us to have a multi-modality outlook on oncology therapy. By engaging in cross-field experimentations in molecular biology, cellular biology, and in vivo application, the synergies of our technologies have created breakthrough advances on an expedited pathway to drug approval.</p>\r\n<p>Our endeavors always revolve around the goal of patient well-being. From our experiences with successful and failed patient therapies, we continue to innovate the best treatment for the individual patient. For clinical practitioners, realizable drug approval according to allotted timeframe is the most practical reality. The course of traditional drug development often takes a decade or more, leaving behind the patients facing cancer today. Johnpro’s approach is to take a bottomsup approach, using patient-monitoring from clinical experiences to gain efficiencies that enable accelerated development.</p>\r\n<p>For patients and oncology researchers, the innovation of effective and cost-appropriate therapies that can be realized by all patients, without exacerbating burdens of patients’ families and healthcare systems is the way forward. This is the raison d&#8217;être for Johnpro, and the aims of our collective endeavor.</p>\r\n<h5><strong>Company Vision : Science, Humanity, Pragmatism</strong></h5>\r\n<p>Our company’s core motto is “Science in Mind, Humanity at Heart.”<br />\r\n-Through science, will we find the path to the Cure.<br />\r\n-Through pragmatism, can we care for the patient.<br />\r\nThe financial means to reach these goals must be built on efficient synergies, not extravagant squanders.

Moreover, in 2015, Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa was back, which facilitates the process of founding a corporation in Taiwan. With the special visa, applicants would get residency for 1 year before setting up a business including the spouse and children under 20. After the expiration, the application can be extend up to 2 years each time, and after being resident for 5 years in Taiwan, applicants are qualified to apply for permanent residency.</p>\r\n<p>Ruchmair, who came to Taiwan from Jamaica to set up his own business in November, said that he had received a call from one of his investors in Jamaica who suggest him to come to Taiwan, not only for the great opportunities here but also for the new program of startups; therefore he did. Ruchmair is only 25-year-old, and used to work on creating software tools which make game development easier in his former company in Jamaica. However, the gaming industry is not popular in Jamaica, so with the ambition and the exclusive visa, Ruchmair came to Taiwan and began to set up the game development company which is just his second company. “This is my first trip in Asia, and I never work for another company here before,” he said. It’s really hard to imagine there are a lot of people willing to start their own business in Taiwan, and even from some countries like Jamaica which is far away from Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p>Ruchmair’s company in Taiwan is also about the game project with focus on the software on mobile devices and named after his own name, Ruchmair. (洛西米爾) He has been working on a game for about 8 months, because it hasn’t released so he laughed and said that he couldn’t talk too much about the game. “We are still working on it,” he said, “we’re trying to bring the games usually fund on the PC or TV to the mobile devices, which is what people expect to find. Although there is only one person in Jamaica that Ruchmair works with, “we’re looking for the other persons to join. It’s just the beginning,” he said with confidence.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1523 aligncenter\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1060102-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1060102-1.png 684w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1060102-1-300x240.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /></p>\r\n<p>When mentioning that he chose Taiwan to start a business, Ruchmair said that he really likes the culture of the East, and working in Taiwan helps him to push his products to China, to Japan, and even to the whole market in Asia. “The Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa makes doing business much easier,” he said. “It only took about 5 minutes to get the visa done. You just have to hand in the passport, take some photos and then you get the visa which pretty impressed me,” he said. Furthermore, Ruchmair mentioned that building startups in Japan for a foreigner is much harder than in Taiwan, so he chose Taiwan as a base and hoped to extent his business to Japan.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking to recommending a friend what to do to start a business in Taiwan, Ruchmair said the very first thing is to check the visa which makes the process easier, because “with the visa there is a company; without the visa there is no company.” Ruchmair also think the industries of software and hardware in Taiwan are really strong and both of the occupations and markets are universal, so for those who wants to enter the Asia market, Taiwan is a perfect step one. He talked about that the game studio is really growing in Taiwan, where there are many impressive studios. “There is also the gaming industry in Jamaica, but it’s not as big as one in Taiwan,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>About the expectation of the entrepreneurial environment in Taiwan in the future, being in Taipei for only 2 months, Ruchmair said that he is still learning the attitudes and behaviors that people have a business here as well as figuring out what businesses are like here to run a company efficiently with the help from the entrepreneurial program of iiiNNO. “I recently meet Taipei, and a lot of things are really impressive and quite different from ones in Jamaica.

Gordon was born in Taiwan, raised in the United States, and enjoys a strong business acumen of his own, including consulting with silicon valley company </span><a href=\"http://www.portrait.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Portrait Displays</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and as a co-founder of VuTech. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The founding partners of Docceo had worked together before &#8211; in 2001 they were with Tablet PC startup PaceBlade, but have come back together to “disrupt hospitality”. The Docceo team has devised a smart solution for hospitality called DigiJames comprised of IoT hardware, Software APP and hotel backend management, delivering smart operations, smart building, and smart service.  DigiJames’  smart-room app gives  hotel guests the ability to control all aspects of their experience from an easy to use tablet placed in their room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The applications of Docceo’s technology go beyond streamlining customer service however. The Docceo app is linked to the cloud  that automatically provides the hotel with customer preference data. The hotel can then automatically make assumptions about guest needs or preferences and anticipate what the customer needs. Furthermore, with aggregate data of many customers over months and years, hotels are able to better manage all aspects of their operations. This is the clever application of machine learning from the cloud.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Docceo is a very young project, it has already garnered much attention both in Taiwan and abroad. Gordon was a delegate at the APEC summit in the Philippines for 2015. Furthermore, Docceo was named the AAN Forum winner for 2015 and has participated in various international business accelerators like </span><a href=\"https://orangefab.com/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OrangeFab</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Docceo’s most obvious achievement has been landing its first paying customer, the five-star Shangri-La Hotel in Taipei and their partnership with Microsoft</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Docceo has also benefited from doing business here in Taiwan. First, hardware development is top notch &#8211; Gordon notes that having so many established hardware companies so close by makes it easy for Docceo to bring their ideas to life, faster than if they were anywhere else. Furthermore, Docceo has developed relationships with the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs (</span><a href=\"http://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/home/English.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MOEA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the Small Medium Enterprise Administration (</span><a href=\"http://www.moeasmea.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=301&amp;mp=2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SMEA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, who helped them to establish further relationships with the </span><a href=\"http://www.apecaccelerator.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">APEC Accelerator Network (AAN)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This expansive network of public, academic, and private contacts has given Docceo exposure to a wealth of advisers and customers. And while the tangible benefits to headquartering in Taiwan are apparent, the less concrete aspects make it attractive as well. “Taiwanese people are internationally minded and well traveled, and it is a convenient place to work and live,” said Gordon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having embarked on such an encouraging start, the firm has optimistic aspirations. “Our first step is to grow in Taiwan, and then expand throughout Asia,” Gordon said about future plans. With the rapid development of the Asian economy, business and tourism are bound to accelerate, generating a greater demand for hotels. “We are ambitious about the next five years,” says Gordon. “We see a worldwide serviceable accessible market of USD 15 Billion and we want a big piece of it”.</span></p></div>\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text -->\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_column -->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_row -->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_section --><div id=\"contactus\" class=\"et_pb_section et_pb_section_2 globalfooter et_pb_with_background et_section_regular\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_4\">\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_5  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_bg_layout_dark  et_pb_text_align_left\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\"><p>          SMEA is the department responsible for helping new startups in Taiwan get off the ground and SMEs to upgrade and transform their businesses.

The first few years weren’t easy she says, but after the second year things picked up. By then Bespoke had developed name recognition and ultimately grew into one of the most preferred wine sellers in Taiwan, and one of the few that specializes in high-end vintages. Their wine mostly comes from the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia, specifically from family owned growers like </span><a href=\"http://www.chalkhill.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chalk Hill Estates</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://www.bethany.com.au/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bethany</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Leong-Good is from Singapore but has worked all over the world. She developed her skills as an employee for Mercedes Benz and rose to the management level before taking a position with Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish manufacturer of high-end audio technology. Her experience positions her well to market and distribute luxuries like high-end wines.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leong-Good found herself in Taiwan eight years ago. After a short hiatus from from the world of international corporate management, she decided she wanted to focus her attention on something she loved, and wine was near the top of her list. Bespoke’s motto is “Passionate About People and Wines” and this philosophy permeates the thinking of the company. Their strategy is to get people interested, and then excited, about the product, as well as to ensure they have a great experience in the process. Customers leave events with more than a bottle (or case) of wine, but also having formed new connections.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bespoke has found a strong niche and they are not worried about being crowded out by larger importers. As Leong-Good notes, “we don’t compete with bulk distributors; we’ve carved a niche in part because we’re not a huge firm and we focus on quality over quantity.” </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bespoke certainly has benefited from being in Taiwan. Unlike tech and finance, which already have strong business networks established, Taiwan’s wine scene is tiny. Being a niche player in a small, “blank slate” market, but one that is growing rapidly, has allowed Bespoke to chart its own course in terms of strategy, like by hosting private tastings and star-studded events.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another huge benefit to being in Taiwan, and one not immediately apparent, is that Taiwan and wine culture are a match made in heaven. Taiwan is a foodie capital of the world, and its eating and drinking culture make wine pairings and multi-course dinners an activity everyone can get behind, local and foreign alike. It isn’t all just in Taipei either &#8211; while Taiwan’s capital is the epicenter of the wine market, there is a demand for luxury goods from Taipei to Tainan to Kaohsiung, meaning there will be increasing demand for good wines with good dinners island-wide. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bespoke has a number of accomplishments under its belt, especially in terms of name recognition and market penetration. Their wines are found in high-end supermarkets like CitySuper and Breeze Supermarket. They were the first distributor with two wines at the W Hotel when it first opened, and now their products are found at all of Taipei’s best hotels. Bespoke has also earned a name for itself through their groundbreaking events. Being located in Taiwan has allowed Bespoke to accomplish much, from developing partnerships with some big names, as well as being able to experiment with unique promotional activities that are totally unique to the island. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bespoke Cellar is a perfect example of what innovative SMEs can aspire to in Taiwan. In an era of high-tech business and speed of light communication, not everyone wants to open the next Google or Facebook.

Taiwan is an excellent location to launch products and services for companies that plan to enter China. It offers a good and controllable environment where one can learn and make adjustments before entering China while enjoying the great living conditions Taiwan has to offer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anemone Venture is headquartered in Taipei with an international team composed of talents from Israel, Taiwan, Korea and France dedicated to help suitable technology companies enter Asia. They also have a branch in Israel to be closer to innovation and R&amp;D developartments. They are so good at what they do that they have even become an official service provider for the members of the Israeli Export Institute.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anemone Ventures benefits greatly from Taiwan’s friendly environment. Since Asia’s main cities are very easy to reach from Taiwan, they can cover much of Asia from their Taipei office . Easy logistics and transportation as well as proactive and skillful employees are essential to all business; Golan says she finds all of this in Taiwan. Furthermore, Taiwan is a rule of law country with good protection and emphasis on intellectual property which is a crucial point for foreign technology companies entering a new market. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taiwan and Israel are so far yet so close. Both countries are small countries filled with technology professionals. It will be exciting to see what future sparks will come from Taiwanese and Israeli companies cooperating and the changes that Anemone Ventures can help bring to this island.

He originally came as a general manager for HTC and founded the mobile giant’s cloud business unit. Before then, Warren spent years in Silicon Valley and has lived all over the United States, as well as internationally. His background means he has a wealth of tech and business experience that made founding his own company a natural step. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roam and Wander attracted </span><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/21/roamandwanderdidi/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">international attention</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with interactive toys funded originally by a Kickstarter campaign, but marketing costs made that project ultimately unsustainable. For years Roam and Wander worked to create its own brand, but has recently pivoted to an agency strategy developing for other companies. They specialize in cloud technology, machine learning, advanced networking solutions, and also act as an incubator for spin off companies &#8211; a tactic they’ve employed multiple times. Warren takes pride in the fact that Roam and Wander doesn’t just take any project thrown their way; “if you have a difficult problem, we’re the people to call,” he says with just a hint of swagger.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roam and Wander’s confidence is well founded. Warren started things off with his own capital, but ended up securing his first major investment from </span><a href=\"http://tmi.vc/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TMI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with whom they still share work space. Now R&amp;W has an investment team made of up of seven major shareholders, including leading Taiwanese VC firms </span><a href=\"http://www.wiharper.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WI Harper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"http://500.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">500 Startups</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They also have a number of angel investors backing them, and Warren’s network in the tech community of Taiwan keeps the firm secure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warren finds Taiwan to be an excellent fit for his organization for a few reasons. First the design and programing talent found in Taiwan is equal to that found in Northern California, but at a discount. He also hails Taiwan’s environment for entrepreneurial development, and like most visitors and expats, he notes Taiwan’s friendly, open culture and people.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One interesting aspect of Roam and Wander is its blending of American and Taiwanese work cultures. We noticed an egalitarian nature to R&amp;W’s office &#8211; desks are set up like cafeteria tables with work stations spread about, and Warren sits with the rest of his staff. Warren has loosely based his management and organizational style on Valve’s system, the gaming company behind </span><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steam</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Roam and Wander works to foster independence and creativity among its staff, Taiwanese and foreign alike. Their organizational style is novel in Taiwan, but it clearly works well and allows the firm more freedom to do projects everyone is passionate about.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We have doubled revenue every quarter for three quarters,” Warren beams, “and we are on track to double again.” Roam and Wander does a lot of things right, not the least of which is being situated in Taipei.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R&amp;W has big plans in coming months; most significantly they are opening offices in San Francisco and New York. Furthermore, Roam and Wander is currently backlogged til 2016, meaning they can’t even begin to work on some clients’ projects until next year. Engagement with the rest of Asia is also high on R&amp;W’s list of priorities. They have an eye on expanding to Hong Kong and eventually tapping the Chinese market, where they already have some contract work. Still, Roam and Wander’s two biggest markets are the US and Taiwan, with business from the States poised to take on a larger share of the company’s efforts. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to see why Roam and Wander would be so appealing to firms in need of tech development. As a Taiwanese company they are able to handle the same caliber work as anyone in Silicon Valley, but at a discount compared to most American developers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roam and Wander is a bold project and they certainly face many challenges. Still, Taiwan offers real benefits. As its tech industry matures and startup culture develops, Roam and Wander will be the kind of company newer firms aspire to emulate. With access to real funding and a tech oriented talent pool, developers and entrepreneurs would be wise to set up shop in Taiwan.</span></p></div>\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text -->\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_column -->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_row -->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div> <!-- .et_pb_section --><div id=\"contactus\" class=\"et_pb_section et_pb_section_2 globalfooter et_pb_with_background et_section_regular\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<div class=\"et_pb_row et_pb_row_4\">\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_5  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_bg_layout_dark  et_pb_text_align_left\">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				<div class=\"et_pb_text_inner\"><p>          SMEA is the department responsible for helping new startups in Taiwan get off the ground and SMEs to upgrade and transform their businesses.

(30, 'A Bar of Soap: What More Could It Be?', '2020-05-09', 'Startup Spotlight', '<p><strong>[Startup Spotlight - Ann Chen]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurship does often lend itself to the question of ‘what if’ leaning a business away from its initially steered direction toward the ideal. It’s compelling to imagine what the world would look like today if either W. Colgate had not produced the ‘Cashmere Bouquet’ soap in 1866, nor without the existence of Procter &amp; Gamble’s ‘Ivory’ in 1879. And, we all have our own practices of personal hygiene complied or avoided in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, for better or worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ann Chen the entrepreneur is merely one of four Ann Chens. She is one of the Olympic gold medalists in history, TV host, and by all accounts, hardly less remarkable as an author. When Chen joined the STARTBOARD incubation program, she already knew what she wanted. &nbsp;Sitting around the meeting table one late Friday evening, Chen and Mason Lin (STARTBOARD’s Project Manager) were discussing the details and direction to transform her vision into reality- The Sustainable Soap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/50093-1.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ann Chen was sharing the vision of her ideal startup with Mason Lin during the mentoring session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For in an eerie way, the soap ideas each entrepreneur left us seems complete, as though nothing more left to be said. It is difficult to imagine soap going beyond cleanliness or skin-nourishing, difficult to imagine soap going beyond the chemical reaction between lye and oil ingredients. Ask yourself: What more could we have expected from a bar of soap?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[The Social Entrepreneurship]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Drucker defined the social enterprise as any business creation that does not only pursue financial objectives and profitability but mainly a certain social change. According to Digital Minister Audrey Tang, diverse forms of social innovation have been developed in Taiwan in the past 20+ years, tackling a wide range of social issues. This leads to a culture shift in redefining success: The success of a social enterprise is the success of ALL involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The nearly-expired cooking oil can do a lot of good- Ann Chen (24<sup>th</sup> April 2020)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017 alone, 12,000 tons of waste cooking oil (WCO) are discarded in Taiwan. The nearly-expired oil is under the umbrella of the WCO- to this, Chen asks, “Are we really discarding that much of WCO at the expense of other people who do not have anything?” Due to its chemical composition, recycling WCO seems the most cost-effective option as it contributes to a growing negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, vapor explosion, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/43880403_2066354603404099_8759739237898649600_o.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture: Soap)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>[The Sustainable Soap Project]</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all these considerations in mind, Chen initiated <em>The Sustainable Soap Project</em>. The objective of this project is to maximize the utility and value of the nearly-expired cooking oils across Taiwan. Instead of ending up in landfills, Chen desires to reuse the nearly-expired oils and transform them into scrumptious-smelling soaps. Meanwhile, all soaps are free of packaging to embrace the spirit of zero-waste. Chen’s first company has been so successful. It inspired her to start a series of handmade soap workshop events for the disabled group, availing them to become business leaders of their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ann Chen is always trying her very best to help people around her. The fragrance of home-made soaps is not only because of aroma of flowers but also with the positive impact of social innovation and SDGs. &nbsp;Ann Chen sets an amazing example for female entrepreneurs, athletes and social innovation advocates. The Olympic gold medalists does not stop her becoming the best herself, neither does the title of business owner. Now, Ann Chen is ready for the next match which is fighting against pollution and waste. No matter who is going to win this match, Ann deserves our respect and applause because she is fighting for each of us and our mother nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/397588.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Group Picture STARTBOARD team and Ann Chen)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">STARTBOARD Founder / CEO Uniform Zhi-Fu Lin</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Annjil Chong | Mason Ching-Yen Lin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-21 03:30:42', '2023-09-25 13:11:48', NULL);

Acoustic design startup: beyond your imagination.', '2020-04-06', 'Startup Spotlight', '<p><strong>【Startup Spotlight–Sounds Great】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are provided with a wide range of social media influencers, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu, each tries their very best to attract our attention. This ongoing influence leads us to continue to watch the next video that is recommended by the algorithm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to studies, about 78% of people are watching online videos every day in Taiwan, therefore the average time of watching is 1.6 hours per day. The thriving media industry is also bringing an increased demand for audio and visual equipment. The research institute, GHK, indicated that the first half of 2019, the global speakers and headphones market reached USD 8.7 billion. In this industry with a bright future, there is an acoustic design startup from Taiwan, that will undoubtedly blow our minds and show us the innovative technology of audio hardware design. The Taiwan-based startup - Sounds Great is founded by Mr. Chou, his classmates, and his instructor in college. Their core technology is using semiconductors and electromagnets to redesign traditional audio speakers. &nbsp;The team responded, “Long story short, we will reduce the size of traditional speakers by 99%, whereas the volume is fifty times louder than before.” Mr. Chou, the founder of Sounds Great, took out a coin from his pocket and spoke, “just imagine that we put a boombox into this coin.” &nbsp; Sounds Great and their core technology makes them stand out from a crowd, as they have also gained many acknowledgments from professionals as well as businesses. Sounds Great also got selected and awarded by the FITI innovation and startup program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【It starts with an idea of bulletproof vest】&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586066614569.png\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture 1: Sounds Great team picture)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Chou flashed back to his college life when he was an undergraduate majoring in Chemistry in FJCU. He found a high-strength fiber material in the lab and was pondering about how to commercialize this material. The initial idea that crossed his mind was “I can use this fiber material to strengthen the bulletproof vest and it will save many soldier’s life!” As a result, Mr. Chou sent testing samples to a testing laboratory and waited for the feedback. The researcher of the testing laboratory showed them the outcome of the testing results and introduced a speaker diaphragm manufacturer, which was looking for a similar fiber material they made. Therefore, Sounds Great pivoted their bulletproof vest business idea to the game-changing acoustic material startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【Early stage - money burning to survive in the winter of R&amp;D】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very beginning of startup life was a tough time. &nbsp;As a hardware startup is not like SaaS, software, and mobile app startup. The capital is burning for the salary, rent, equipment, testing materials and so forth. It wore out their passion and entrepreneur dream of this budding startup and suddenly brought them back to reality. Mr. Chou recalled their early stage. To gain more financial aids, Mr. Chou brought their proposal to meet with various investors, apply for government subsidies, and exhibit in startup expo. &nbsp;Then, Sounds Great received a wonderful chance to be chosen in the FITI program organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology and represented Taiwan startup to receive business training in Singapore for a month. In the early stage, they adjusted and restructured their business model from the opinions by mentors in Singapore. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【External investment - the spring is around the corner】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After burning the midnight oil day by day, Sounds Great has finally proved its core technology and collects enough experiment data. Recently, Sounds Great is a partner with the semiconductor market leader to start further steps of product-market fit. Mr. Chou showed the chairs in the office and said, “we have some nice and comfortable chairs here because we seep at the office often.” Sounds Great is a member of the STARTBOARD incubation program. The first investor meetup does not have any financial support, but that was an excellent experience for them to sharpen their pitch skills and business proposal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurship is hard, especially for the first couple of years; however, Sounds Great has developed a strong foundation for their business from previous failures. The student startup–Sounds Great has transformed and became more mature in both their mentality and product. Then, their pitch and business are receiving more and more helpful feedback from different pitch competitions and investors. Sounds Great was enduring through the winter of being an underdog and finally obtained the investor’s monetary support and received a lot of public attention last year. This investment boosts the team and their product; Meanwhile, there are some global brands that see the potentiality of the innovation of audio devices. Sounds Great receives more support from the hearing-aid company as well as the Government. For this budding startup, Spring has come earlier than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n		<tr></tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>【The global business strategy and risk management】</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1586066602443.png\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture 2: Mr. Chou was explaining their core technology to the patent consultants)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a whiteboard with a clear roadmap of business strategy and patent portfolio at Sounds Great’s office. The demand for home theatre and smart home devices has increased significantly and the acoustics development has been technologically stagnant for years. Sounds Great is ready to take action to make good use of their game-changing audio technology, either having their brand or becoming the OEM partner of audio equipment companies. Besides US and European markets, Sounds Great is also planning to strategically expand their business in Singapore and Vietnam, and arrange for the Southeast Asia market. During the interview, Sounds Great would like to recruit talented engineers specialized in semiconductor, acoustic devices, and product development. If you are the one with the desired background, Sounds Great welcome you to join this high-potential startup to bring the world a better audio experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CMvU8pnafs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CMvU8pnafs</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">STARTBOARD Founder / CEO Uniform Zhi-Fu Lin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ching-Yen Lin | Jeannette Lealofi</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-05-21 03:34:52', '2023-09-25 13:10:55', NULL),
(32, 'NextGen bolsters Taiwan’s global competitiveness by developing business communication skills', '2020-06-03', 'Startup Interview', '<p>Many Taiwanese enterprises are eager to improve their employees’ English language proficiency. NextGen offers enterprises customizable and specialized corporate language training, focusing on specific learning objectives to deliver tangible results in enhancing business communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to raise English language proficiency levels and strengthen Taiwan’s national competitiveness, the government is seeking to transform Taiwan into a bilingual nation by 2030. Surveys have found that even though most enterprises in Taiwan have employees that are proficient in English, these employees often give others the impression of being reserved, shy, and quiet. What they need are social and communication skills, which are an essential aspect of doing business and greatly influence the outcomes of negotiations, meetings, conferences, and presentations. NextGen helps enterprises advance by providing professional corporate language training designed to significantly improve business communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transforming corporate English language training with flexible and customizable courses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 30 years of experience in English language education and training, Brian Mc Closkey, General Manager of NextGen Corporate Language Training, is firmly committed to making Taiwan more competitive on the global stage by empowering professionals from all sectors through the company’s training courses. Since Mc Closkey graduated from Trinity College in Dublin with a master’s degree in education in 1988, he has built a career in the field of English language education and training in Taiwan. With his extensive experience and expertise, Mc Closkey gained a clear picture of the Taiwanese learning environment and education system, saw an opportunity to improve English language education in Taiwan, and built his own business by venturing into the field of corporate language training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/NextGen%204.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 800px;\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a startup company, Mc Closkey began with a few core members and trainers, all with a background in corporate training. In line with the company’s motto—“what we teach today, you use tomorrow”—NextGen provides unique corporate training, occupying a key niche market without real competitors. According to Mc Closkey, NextGen offers flexible and customizable courses that are focused on enterprises’ needs. Before training commences, he will first talk to the customer’s HR department to better understand their needs and identify content to meet those needs. He will then adjust existing modules and design new ones to fulfill the customer’s demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When talking to HR departments, we often find that what the customer really needs is not language training but social and communication skills,” said Mc Closkey. Most enterprises already have employees proficient in English, who require goal-oriented learning to improve communication skills for meetings, presentations, leadership, and management. NextGen delivers three key advantages. First, NextGen provides measurable results with immediate improvement; competency-based training modules and rubrics for measuring outcomes are used throughout the courses. Second, course content is expressly designed to fulfill the needs of the customer. Third, innovative teaching methods are employed, e.g., face-to-face teaching, e-learning, virtual learning, webinars, or any combinations of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We see ourselves more as consultants and advisors than as English teachers,” Mc Closkey said proudly. For instance, NextGen embarked on a project with Yuanta Securities, which wanted to expand in Asia and needed its employees to be able to professionally deliver presentations and quarterly business reviews in English. Another major client, the multinational gaming company Blizzard, asked NextGen to create a course specifically for project management skills. Meanwhile, a major project involving leadership skills is being conducted with Gogoro, also a company aiming to expand internationally.<strong><br><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/NextGen%203.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 800px;\"></strong>\r\n	<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building the brand and expanding the business</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though endorsements from high-profile customers have bolstered NextGen’s marketing efforts and revenue growth, it still faces many obstacles. Skilled trainers with a strong background in education aren’t always easy to find. And as the popularity of the courses has grown and more customers have adopted NextGen’s training, it has become more challenging to protect intellectual property. NextGen has also sought additional funds from investors and the government to expand further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2020, NextGen held discussions with the Consulting Service Centre of the Small &amp; Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA), MOEA. Although NextGen did not secure any funds, it did receive assistance from the NiEA in understanding government operations and identifying channels to apply for financial support. NextGen will be ready to apply for funding once new applications will be accepted by the government in October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking toward the future, NextGen has devised a short-, medium-, and long-term plan to attain further growth. In the short term, NextGen will continue to build its brand and increase and enhance the content it offers to clients. The medium-term plan is to generate more revenue and gain more customer testimonials. And the long-term plan is to find new funding sources and expand the business. “I have an attractive, low-risk product and our business model is profitable and scalable,” said an ambitious Mc Closkey. He is confident that with more investment coming in, the company will be able to expand rapidly and realize its mission of empowering Taiwanese professionals to thrive in international business environments.</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-06-03 07:46:51', '2023-09-25 13:10:28', NULL),
(33, 'Argentinian jazz pianist makes Taiwan his home and gives back to society', '2020-10-08', '', '<p>At a traditional Taiwanese wedding banquet, friends, family, and guests of the newlywed couple enjoy exquisite dishes and delicious wine, while the sounds of a piano play in the background. Abruptly, the audience stops eating, drinking, and chatting. Everyone turns toward the band to listen to the music. Some people even start to hum and sing along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The song that has caught everyone’s attention is <em>Hold My Hand</em>, a simple yet beautiful song from the early 1990s that touched Taiwanese people’s hearts when it was first released. The song’s lyrics depict a married couple’s persistence in facing life’s struggles, a theme that resonates with most people at the wedding banquet. As the pianist finishes his performance and walks off the stage, the audience are surprised to see he is not Taiwanese, admiring him for being able to express a traditional Taiwanese song in such an authentic way. The pianist is Martin Musaubach, an Argentinian immigrant who considers Taiwan his second home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/with%20Gary.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>Martin Musaubach performs with Gary</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Passion for music</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Musaubach, called Musa by friends, was born in 1982 and grew up in La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires Province. As a child, he received a small wooden piano toy as a gift from his grandmother and fell in love with the instrument immediately. Being from a lower-middle-class family, he did not have the resources to attend piano lessons consistently, so his musical training was often interrupted. “I never practiced, I just played and played. I had fun playing,” he said. For Musaubach, having fun is the only thing that’s important in music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He learned music mostly by listening. At the age of 12, a teacher recommended that he join a blues band, whose other members were almost 10 years older. With the band, he was able to perfect his skills in keyboard playing. The band served as a pivot in his adolescent life, providing him with significant emotional support, especially during the time of his parents’ divorce. After graduating from high school, his father wanted him to study law. However, after trying for four months, he gave up the idea of becoming a lawyer and went back to La Plata to work and study at a college to become a music teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, he entered a jazz band competition organized by a Hong Kong agency and won. He spent several years in the Greater China region, working as the band’s keyboard player. While touring and performing, he gained recognition and built a reputation for himself. In 2012, he met the renowned Taiwanese producer Michael Tu in Beijing, who invited him and his band to come to Taiwan to produce an album for a Taiwanese artist. Hence, he traveled to Taiwan and fell in love with its people and culture. Even though he had to overcome many obstacles, such as learning the language, getting used to the culture, and making a living, he still decided to settle in Taiwan. According to immigration law, he was required to make an investment and establish a business in Taiwan. Therefore, he founded the music production company 3690 Studio Ltd. in 2013. Due to the language barrier, cultural differences, and unfamiliarity with regulations, Musaubach had to rely on his Taiwanese friends for help. He also got significant assistance and advice from the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association with regard to setting up his company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img data-fr-image-pasted=\"true\" src=\"https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/with%20Kids%20from%20Free%20Music%20Course.jpg.jpg\" data-result=\"success\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" style=\"width: 900px;\">\r\n	<br>Martin Musaubach with kids form free music course</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Giving back to society</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a composer, arranger, performer, and teacher, Musaubach is very active in the music sector. He released his first album, titled <em>3690</em>, in 2013 and his multi-award-winning second album <em>All Kinds of Good</em> in 2017, which attracted a large fan base and had a significant impact. Besides actively collaborating with other artists, he also frequently tours internationally, giving performances and participating in jazz festivals. Several projects in particular were dear to his heart. He recorded the album <em>Kacalisiyan: Canción de la Cuesta</em> together with indigenous tribes, combining South American music with traditional Taiwanese indigenous songs. He also worked with the indigenous singer Aljenljeng Tjaluvie (Abao) and collaborated with P.i.N to form a duo called Indigo Soul Children, releasing the eponymous album <em>Indigo Soul Children</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After nine years working in Asia, mostly in Mandarin-speaking countries and especially in Taiwan, 2017 marked a turning point for Musaubach. He decided that it was time to give back to the society that had provided him with the freedom and stability to develop as an artist. Therefore, he wrote and established the Twentieth-Century Popular Music Course and started teaching the three-month-long music course to the public for free at Taipei Artist Village Cafe. Additionally, he also gave free jazz piano lessons to students in need. “I do not play and make music to become rich. I only take what is needed to take care of my family; the rest I gladly give back to society,” stated Musaubach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musaubach believes that education is the key to change the world, and in his own way, he is doing his part. “I am publishing a new, free book very soon, which I have been working on for almost three years and teaches students the importance of collaboration and how to make and produce popular music from scratch,” said Musaubach. For him, the act of delivering education free of charge can help make the world a better place and support local communities. Looking ahead, he intends to continue providing free education, collaborate with indie artists and bands, and promote local and indigenous music.</p>', NULL, 1, '2020-12-31 01:59:19', '2023-09-25 13:07:27', NULL);
