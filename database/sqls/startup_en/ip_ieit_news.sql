<p>The trend for startups to go global is reflected in Business Next’s annual report on Taiwan’s startup ecosystem: among the surveyed 200+ startups, 74.9% have been either operating globally (26%) or planning on expanding overseas soon (48.9%).</p>

<p><strong>The top three foreign markets startups are planning to expand to are: Southeast Asia (41.7%), Japan (33%), and China (33%), followed by the US (24.2%), Korea (11.6%), and Europe (7.7%).</strong></p>

<p>It’s the demographic dividend, growing penetration of smartphones and the Internet that drives them to Southeast Asia. According to a&nbsp;<a href="//www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/" title="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/">latest research</a> by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company, the Internet economy in SEA will triple in size and hit a whopping $300B by 2025. And there are emerging opportunities in many more industries due to those factors.</p>

<p>As a result, it’s not surprising to learn that the predominant reason for the surveyed to expand globally is to explore a bigger/new market and expand user base, as confirmed by 95.5%. 25% go abroad to find investors.</p>

<p>But localization remains one of the biggest challenges for these startups, especially in Southeast Asia, a region consisting of countries with distinct culture and language. There’s no one-size-fits-all strategy to develop each of these markets.</p>

<p>Among the surveyed, 37.3% encounter the greatest difficulty in dealing with language and cultural barriers; 20.8% say they find it the most challenging to adapt their business models to meet different market needs.</p>

<p>Localization is equally important in mature markets&nbsp;like Japan. That’s why travel startup&nbsp;<a href="//www.kkday.com/en" title="//www.kkday.com/en">KKday</a> hired a group of Japanese in Taiwan to rewrite its web content before expanding to Japan, and diabetes tracking app company&nbsp;<a href="//www.health2sync.com/" title="//www.health2sync.com/">Health2Sync</a> added a Japanese marketing director to their team to make sure their products are attractive for local customers.</p>

<p>Besides challenges of localization,18.3% and 12.6% say they have difficulties in seeking funding and finding talent, respectively.</p>

<p>It has been running its second Startup Week in Taipei during the same week. It’s a 5-day event that brings together members in the startup community to celebrate and learn about entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Besides startup events, Techstars is well known for its accelerator program that has supported 1,800+ early-stage startups across the world and created 170+ successful exits. However, it’s simply one of the many tools for growth-seeking startups, said VP Innovation Chris Heivly.</p>
<p><strong>In Taiwan, instead, Techstars is focusing on the “foundational work” that propels startup success; that is, creating meaningful connections between startups, resources, and key players in the community. Mr. Heivly said the organization sees its role as that of a “facilitator” that enables the development of a fully fledged innovation ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>With Techstars’ worldwide network of 10,000+ mentors and 3,000 thousand alumni, the program will open door for Taiwan startups to opportunities overseas.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu-Chin Hsu, Deputy Minister of Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), said his ministry is committed to “introducing top global startup resources to Taiwan and helping startups to further connect to international markets.” It has also backed TTA, a local startup ecosystem builder and incubator, to host a number of international accelerators including MOX, SparkLabs Taipei, IAPS, and BE.</p>
<p>ST Liew, President of Qualcomm Taiwan &amp; SEA, showed great support for the program, confirming this program as “a critical step to bridge Taiwan startups with the global community.”</p>
<p>This year, with the aim to put these startups on the global stage, the multinational semiconductor company has launched an incubation project, the Qualcomm Innovate in Taiwan Challenge (QITC), to support the growth of Taiwan startups focusing on areas such as 5G, cellular connected IoT, machine learning, smart cities, and so on.</p>
<p>“Entering the 5G era, the competition in cutting-edge technology innovation will be fierce,” Mr. Liew said. “In 2020, we will collaborate with Techstars in introducing more international resources to prepare local startups for a new and exciting time.”</p>

Know-how and success stories were shared as aspiring entrepreneurs in Taiwan joined other participants worldwide to build a global entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the support of 61 government agencies and institutions—including 22 startup incubators, 13 central government agencies, seven local government departments, 10 college and university partners, and nine institutions—a total of 55 entrepreneurship-related events took place across the island from November 18 to 24. The Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted SBIR Program Information Events, the SME Leadership and Business Succession Summit, SME Innovation and Digital Transformation, the Entrepreneurship Academy, the APEC Financial Opportunities Fair for Women-led MSMEs, and a lecture and counseling session in Kinmen County.</p>

<p>GEW is an international initiative launched by the Kauffman Foundation in 2008. It connects participants with entrepreneurial opportunities and encourages them to work together and brainstorm innovative ideas that provide solutions to existing problems. A total of 250,000 people have taken part in over 300 entrepreneurship-related events and activities hosted by the government and the private sector in Taiwan since we joined the initiative in 2010.</p>
<p>Kicking off the series of events on November 18 was a lecture entitled “Lessons from Failure: Things to Learn from Failed Startups.” The speaker shared the eight essential characteristics of a successful entrepreneur and discussed tests that can help people identify the type of entrepreneurs they are, so as to lower the failure rate. On November 19 and 20, representatives from ASEAN countries participated in the SME Leadership and Business Succession Summit. Well-known speakers from different fields were invited by the organizer and the American Institute in Taiwan to share with SMEs in Taiwan ways to embrace transformation and AI-based digitization and take advantage of available opportunities.</p>
<p>This year’s GEW focused on encouraging and accelerating female entrepreneurship, as this could have the same positive effect that the entry of women into the labor force had during the previous century. On November 20, a micro-entrepreneurship workshop was held for women, older people and residents from offshore islands who plan to create micro enterprises. Attendees learned about free entrepreneurship-related courses and counseling sessions as well as subsidies available to assist them in embarking on a successful entrepreneurship journey. This year, the SMEA also joined forces with Russia to organize the APEC Financial Opportunities Fair for Women-led MSMEs. By accessing capacity building platforms, female entrepreneurs can acquire financial resources, strategies and experience, and expand their networks to connect with international opportunities.</p>

<p>Useful workshops and lectures were held to train aspiring entrepreneurs. On November 21, the SMEA’s Entrepreneurship Academy held a lecture on entrepreneurship knowledge and skills to help startup teams or enterprises grow at a faster pace. The aim was to encourage people who have managerial responsibilities but lack business and management backgrounds to gain management knowledge and skills and thereby enhance company efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>Those living in rural communities also had ample opportunities to realize their dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. On November 22, the Executive Yuan’s Startup Hub collaborated with the Kinmen County government, Kinmen Startup Hub, Taiwan Business Bank and Commerce Development Research Institute to host a lecture and counseling session in Kinmen to help local startups access available government resources.</p>
<p>The 2019 Maker Festival, held at the National Taiwan Science Education Center on November 23, featured a competition, an award ceremony, lectures, workshops, and other interesting activities, enabling visitors to experience the joy of being a maker. The 15 projects selected were displayed at a special exhibition.</p>
<p>On November 24, the GEW concluded with the IoT Innovative Application Annual Summit. This year’s summit, held in the form of a panel discussion, focused on information and communication security in the wake of the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). The event introduced the basic concepts of web-based authentication, various types of benchmark applications, and ways to establish comprehensive information security mechanisms, allowing participants to acquire a better understanding of the importance of information security in the era of IoT.</p>
<p>Many other lectures, workshops and events were held during the GEW, with participants giving positive feedback.

This can be really frustrating, but early-stage founders don’t often realise that these false starts are real opportunities.</p>
<p>Why? When founders give this product to new users, they are trying to help a new customer fare better than those “normal” people who do things in what founders consider the “old way.”</p>
<p>Most people using a new feature or a product for the first time are used to doing business, or experiencing something in what they consider the normal way. They are not like the founder, who has dreamed up a vision of how things should be done. When a founder gives this new product to a potential customer, she is trying to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell the product!</li>
<li>Integrate this new vision into the customer’s reality.</li>
<li>Solve a problem that often a potential customer didn’t even know they had.</li>
</ol>
<p>This new approach takes time to understand and appreciate. It’s almost like taking someone and plopping them down in a new culture, or in a different era somewhere far into the future. By giving these potential customers something very new, they will approach it with some skepticism, some doubt, and some reasons why it won’t work.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s inevitable that a first trial will end in incremental data and not much customer acquisition.</p>
<p>But this new confrontation with tech is a chance to seek feedback. This feedback creates a cycle of improvement. This is why founders who struggle with their own problem first usually have a better chance of finding product-market fit.</p>
<p>I will tell you a story about a founder who went through <a title="https://appworks.tw/accelerator" href="https://appworks.tw/accelerator">the AppWorks Accelerator</a> and launched his own product successfully to demonstrate this point.</p>
<h2>The Park</h2>
<p>It was a spring day in Taipei around the year 2011 and then-Googler Andy Cheng was looking for a house to buy. Married and with a young son, Andy wanted a property his family could grow into. A real estate agent showed him a house in a desirable neighborhood. A stretch of park just behind the house meant this was exactly what he was looking for.</p>
<p>Andy nearly made an offer. Then he found out that the park was slated for school construction. Rushing to close, the broker hid this from Andy. The seed of an idea was planted in Andy’s mind.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘Man, what else have you not told me,’” says Andy, as he looked back at how he developed <a title="https://www.foundi.info/" href="https://www.foundi.info/">foundi</a> (AppWorks #8), a real estate listing platform.</p>
<p>The first thought Andy had had when he set to work was not: How could he solve the problem of a culture of manipulation and secrecy that seemed endemic to real estate brokers?</p>
<p>He only sees that his startup could make an impact in that area in retrospect. Like many founders, Andy’s MVP alone didn’t help the real end user &#8212; at the time, house buyers &#8212; but it started a process that eventually got him there. And this is really important for early founders to understand.</p>
<p>A new product alone is never enough to create scale and customer growth. You have to do a whole lot of digging to get there.</p>
<h2>How It Started</h2>
<p>From Andy’s perspective, there were so many houses to choose from, so wouldn’t trust and honesty be the winning factor for an agent closing a contract?</p>
<p>Andy learned that relatively low-paid real estate agents live off of commission, and in doing so, they often worked in ferocious competition against each other, even in the same agencies. In contract bidding &#8212; even before negotiations &#8212; the potential future sale of a home often goes to the agent that creates the most perfect too good to be true contract. House sellers want a good return, so agents will find ways to make their pitch of the future contract as lucrative as possible.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the price is true, or if it accurately reflects the true conditions of the house. It’s every man for himself.</p>
<p>It gets worse!</p>
<p>Since every agent is motivated by commission, agents who are first to find the listing will also try to hide the listing info from other agents, making it nearly impossible for other agents to pitch a contract.</p>
<p>This unethical weirdness became more than an engineering puzzle for Andy, who was quite proficient with software programming and maps. Previously, he had worked as one of Google’s first hires in Taiwan, managing a team of engineers in the maps division. Code and problem-solving are in his wheelhouse. “I always go to the computer to code, to figure things out,” he says. But to tackle this problem, he had to go beyond the screen.</p>
<p>He created an early version of foundi. House sellers and buyers would use that version to find information about listings. But they took this info back to agents and used it to try to haggle better deals. This put burdens on the buyers of houses, though; this was exactly the position Andy was in before and didn’t want.</p>
<p>He booked meetings with influential agencies and set up face-to-face consultations. He discovered that real estate agents were typically not the best performers in school. They are also technology-averse. It explained a lot.</p>
<p>With the right technology, they wouldn’t have had to be dishonest to compete. By sitting down and walking through foundi features with early adopter agents, Andy finally got to a point where he was able to convince more of them to use the product.</p>
<p>Like an arms dealer selling his weapons to different cartels, Andy started to spread his tool to different agencies. Whereas previously agents in the same agencies would be pitted against each other, teams began to perform at a higher level. Other agencies saw agencies doing better, and wanted the same tool.</p>
<p>“I felt like I was a warlord,” Andy jokes.</p>
<p>Has he made the market more transparent? It’s hard to say this early in the game. But according to Andy, this counterintuitive outcome holds promise.</p>
<p>By taking away the old things that made agents competitive &#8212; their secrecy and manipulation &#8212; he has actually made real estate agents more competitive. Therein lies a fundamental concept of startup building, and the core reason why data drives product development. Early-stage founders might take note of this technique.</p>
<p>Now, Andy’s customers number about 12,000 agents of the total 40,000 in Taiwan, who rely on foundi to serve their customers better and in turn maximize their income. Andy takes a long-term approach to this door-to-door sales effort.</p>
<p><strong>“ For [what will be] a hundred-year-old tree, I will say we are now at the stage of ‘small tree,’ but strong and healthily growing up,” says Andy.</strong></p>
<p>Creating new tech to solve real problems is really the experience of giving people new mental models to live a better life. If a founder has a good head on his shoulders, and is passionate about what he’s doing, he will eventually build something that people need, in a market people didn’t know could exist. No newly launched product can do this immediately. It’s always a process, and it involves founders stepping away from the computer and even leaving the building, to get it right.</p>
<p>Answers, and your product, exist in people’s heads and hearts, whether they know it or not. As a founder, you are quite simply the enabler that will help them experience that by delivering a tangible good that unlocks a mental model. Think of it as a game, with a constant state of going on side quests. Without those quests, you cannot complete the journey.</p>

<p>He has just received a Golden Horse Award nomination for the Best New Director in November. It’s widely recognized as the Chinese-language equivalent of the Oscars.</p>

<p>With such distinctive background, Mr. Hsu tells us he feels that he has always been an outsider in the movie industry. “Filmmakers think I’m simply working on my startup and blockchain since I didn’t take the traditional career path to be a director,” he says.</p>

<p>Likewise, in the circle of entrepreneurs, most people don’t believe he has much chance of success, either — in that he relies on his film to attract investment as raising funds from venture capitalists has become a common practice for most startups to take their business to the next level.</p>

<p>The film is one of Mr. Hsu’s many projects on the way to achieving his ambition. He also founded&nbsp;<a href="https://selftoken.co/" title="https://selftoken.co/">Self Token</a> two years ago to create a token called Self on Ethereum to raise capital from the crowd for the film.</p>

<p>Mr. Hsu says the key message he wants to convey through this cinematic attempt is the importance in “taking action.” He says “it’s difficult to try to accomplish anything for people in our generation,” noting that one will be faced with three obstacles as soon as embarking on an entrepreneurial journey: social norms, existing power structures, and expectations from investors.</p>

<p>This movie is less about blockchain and corporate warfare but more about how an individual should “take action” to prove their value as the society tries to drag them down by imposing numerous constraints. Reminiscent of the story of Sisyphus, the action has its significance if considered an attempt to fight back, he says.</p>

<p>To Mr. Hsu, issuing the new token Self is one of his ways to fight back as well. To promote immersive entertainment, he hopes to invite everyone to engage in an inclusive and transparent economic system based on blockchain technology. But first, he believes, the token should be used in daily lives for people to feel its benefits.</p>

<p>With the Ethereum-based token, his audience is able to make transactions in the movie scenes recreated in real life. For example, one can pay with Self for a cocktail that a movie character drinks in the film.</p>

<p>Through blockchain, the interaction between films and fans can last long after the screening and be a part of people’s lives, Mr. Hsu says.</p>

<p>Self Token also works with ezding, one of the biggest movie ticket booking platforms in Taiwan, as well as bookstores and restaurants, to expand the use and circulation of its token. Of course, one can buy themselves a drink with Self in Mr. Hsu’s bars.</p>

<p>Users are able to complete transactions in three seconds, a lot faster than on bitcoin, and receive reward points for supporting the decentralized community.</p>

<p>Self can be used in Selfer Card, a decentralized card game based on&nbsp;<em>The Last Thieves</em>. Players will be randomly assigned to the team of either sages or thieves to accumulate points in the virtual world through making transactions, interacting with other players, and so on, in real life.</p>

<p>“Through Selfer Card, we can turn the world into a huge playground,” Self Token&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/self-token-cn/%E8%81%96%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%9C-%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2-selfer-card-%E5%85%A8%E9%9D%A2%E9%87%8B%E5%87%BA-8de59862276" title="https://medium.com/self-token-cn/%E8%81%96%E4%BA%BA%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%9C-%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2-selfer-card-%E5%85%A8%E9%9D%A2%E9%87%8B%E5%87%BA-8de59862276">says</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hsu insists the use of Self should always be relevant to building immersive entertainment experiences for the public. That’s why, he says, it’s important to ensure the attractiveness of the virtual world he provides, such as one that is based on&nbsp;<em>The Last Thieves</em>.</p>

<p>He has been conceiving the plot for the next film, he says, about a hotel, and we can start to expect various stories to unravel in the immersive environment he creates based on the new play.</p>

Back Founder, for example, has been working closely with Japan’s major crowdfunding site Green Funding to introduce Taiwan’s high-quality products to Japanese customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.backer-founder.com/" title="https://www.backer-founder.com/">Back Founder</a> is a Taiwan-based consultancy firm that provides professional guidance for crowdfunding campaign launchers.

<p>Earlier in November, Green Funding has joined Meet Taipei 2019 with BoCo’s bone conduction earphones set. It’s the highest-funded crowdfunding project in Japan, with $1.3M (¥150M) raised in two months.</p>

<p>By comparison, the record in Taiwan stands approximately at $2.3M, $1M more than that in Japan, despite a 5.5 times difference in population between the two countries.</p>

<p>Tahan Lin, Founder and CEO of Back Founder, observes that Taiwan’s crowdfunding market is highly mature, noting that numerous Japanese projects have been funded double the amount they raise at home. Yusuke Takahashi, Director at Green Funding, says he has been in Taiwan for more than 10 times — to participate in exhibitions and activities for crowdfunding projects.</p>

<p>What are the opportunities for campaign launchers? Mr. Lin tells us that the Taiwanese tend to gravitate towards lifestyle products, whereas this type of products is overall unpopular in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. Takahashi further delineates whom the backers of crowdfunding campaigns in Japan are: men at the age of 30 to 50, who like techie and functional products and prefer colors of low chroma like black, white, and grey. In Taiwan, on the other hand, backers are fond of designer products that are creative and cute.</p>

<p>Another main difference lies in gender distribution: in Taiwan, the difference between the numbers of male and female backers is not as significant as in Japan, where 75 out of 100 are men. Most Japanese crowdfunding sites are now grappling with strategies to attract more female backers and encourage product diversity on their platform, says Mr. Takahashi.</p>

<p>He believes his team should introduce more baby and pet products to the site, for example. However, an increase in the number of such products hasn’t yet been observed.</p>

<p>In fact, this type of products seems to be particularly tricky. Mr. Lin says customers buy them only when they’re sure it’s safe to use them on their children and fur kids, whom they can pamper.</p>

<p>Despite the difficulty to promote these products, they can still be quite a success in Taiwan because brands and producers are able to find a trustworthy third party to endorse them.</p>

<p>Overall, a peculiarity of Japanese people explains why the performance of Japan’s crowdfunding market lags behind that in Taiwan: they are cautious, Mr. Takahashi says, and they trust homegrown companies more.</p>

<p>What can Taiwanese crowdfunding sites can learn from their Japanese counterparts? On Japanese platforms, one may stumble across many interesting projects, including animations and other types of artwork that are considered intellectual property, says Mr. Lin, and these are elements that can perhaps be added to Taiwanese platforms.</p>

<p>His company Back Founder has been dedicated to bringing Taiwan’s products to the global stage and next year, it seeks to launch more of those on Japanese and Korean crowdfunding sites. Mr. Lin adds that working with local partners like Green Funding will be especially helpful if these products get to enter local retail marketplace after the crowdfunding experience.</p>

<p>However, it seems inevitable that they start on US crowdfunding sites, including Indiegogo and Kickstarter, before entering the Japanese market, says Mr. Takahashi. This helps to earn trust from Japanese backers, who are drawn to American culture.</p>

<p>Mr. Lin says crowdfunding projects from Taiwan should be funded at least half to one-third the amount they raise at home in Japan, if those from Japan can raise $2M in Taiwan while they receive merely $1M at home; yet it’s not the case in reality. He believes a better communication strategy is the key to break into the market, and Back Founder will learn more about it by continuing its exploration.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('Newly released data shows GSEA founders have a huge growth opportunity going forward', '2019-12-04', 'news', '<p>The latest Map of Greater Southeast Asia’s digital economies, released by&nbsp;<a href="https://appworks.tw/" title="https://appworks.tw/">AppWorks</a>, a leading accelerator and venture capital firm in the region, is indicating to founders that the rise of mobile broadband in economies where GDP growth is accelerating past 6 per cent is setting the stage for amazing improvisation in tech use and commercial problem-solving. It may come as a surprise to some, but Taiwan can play a pivotal role in that innovation surge.</p>

<p>As the supporter of the largest accelerator-born community in the region focused on tech founders, our team watches closely these developments. Our portfolio companies and the 1113 founders and 376 active startups of our Accelerator alumni network are living examples of the magnet that Taiwan has become for founders in this region.</p>

<h2>Starting small, in a huge region called GSEA</h2>

<p>We refer to this region as Greater Southeast Asia (GSEA), positioning it as ASEAN + Taiwan, inclusive of such territories as Hong Kong and Macau, and East Timor. The nomenclature is driven by our observation of consumption habits and statistical data, as you can see in the map below, which hangs in our accelerator space.</p>

<p><strong>We include Taiwan in this grouping because its economic evolution has become something of a beacon for SEA founders who want to build beachheads around the region.</strong> Let’s start with a single statistic to understand why.</p>

<p>The total e-commerce economy market size in Taiwan is USD$42 billion. This is almost 66 per cent of the size of the entire GSEA combined.</p>

<h2>Founders who emerge in GSEA and come to Taiwan to grow stronger</h2>

<p>This unique attribute of Taiwan is a magnet. There is also a push factor in ASEAN nations. That mechanism is prompting SEA founders to seek out a tested, developed market for their ideas.</p>

<p>This movement is observable through growth statistics that suggest a plethora of pent up consumption demand driven by tech adoption and through example companies that have done it. Let’s start with the country data.</p>

<p>Five countries in GSEA show growth in GDP per capita of over 6 per cent, as of last year. They are Cambodia at 6.83 per cent; Laos at 6.72 per cent; Vietnam at 6.5 per cent; the Philippines at 6.47 per cent; Myanmar at 6.45 per cent. Indonesia and East Timor show growth of 5.2 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, a country of 95 million people, many early-stage startups are rapidly developing — Sky Mavis; Axie Infinity; Triip.me (AW#18). Engineering talent that moved overseas and went to tough schools like Harvard have now come back and are starting new companies by the dozens.</p>

<p>In Indonesia, we have seen the growth of five unicorns, including Gojek and Bukalapak. In other areas, it’s not so straightforward.</p>

<p>Google recently released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/" title="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/tools-resources/research-studies/e-conomy-sea-2019-swipe-up-and-to-the-right-southeast-asias-100-billion-internet-economy/">yearly results</a> from a long-term study that looked at the potential for SEA’s growth.</p>

<p>Today, seven urban centres drive over 50 per cent of the internet economy in the countries depicted in GSEA. The “beyond metros,” or rural areas of a few SEA countries, account for 85 per cent of the population, but only 48 per cent of the Internet economy, as you can see from the picture below.</p>

<p>While use cases may exist for tech, and while consumer demand may be growing, it’s harder to really scale in some emerging markets without solid strategies and consistent talent.</p>

<p>Even though the creativity and innovation ideas are off the charts, many things like stagnant offline players, unavailability of engineering talent, government red tape and just pure infrastructure fragmentation stand in the way of “moving fast and breaking things,” so to speak.</p>

<p>SEA founders are coming to Taiwan is because they see a microcosm of development opportunities in Taiwan that they can take back to the rest of Asia, after getting focused here.</p>

<p>“Taiwan was a great gateway to Chinese-speaking countries [in SEA],” says Triip.me founder Hai Ho (AW#18). “There are [also] 200,000 and growing Vietnamese living in Taiwan. There are more daily direct flights between Taiwan and Vietnam, too. It is a good market.”</p>

<h2>AppWorks startups are gaining momentum in Taiwan</h2>

<p>Over 376 AppWorks startups have continued to scale and expand by staging in Taiwan through our Accelerator or by becoming one of the AppWorks portfolio companies. Over 1,113 founders in our network have helped the country become a focal point for this region’s growth.</p>

<p>These companies demonstrate just how nimbly a company locating in Taiwan can grow, figure out e-commerce strategies, and even acquire other companies and engineering teams while nurturing a huge market inside and outside of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Shopback (AW#13), the e-rebates payment platform founded by Henry Chan and Joel Leong in Singapore, came to Taiwan to scale up their e-commerce knowledge and market deployment.</p>

<p>Shopback has reported annualized sales figures of USD$500 million a year. It has operations in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

<p>Some other investments include 91APP (Taiwan’s Shopify); Carousell, which has localised to Taiwan by building an office here (it’s also localised in several other ASEAN markets).</p>

<p>Taiwan is also the kind of place where you can build a company, or two, and IPO them, in a relatively quick time. For example, Jerry Kuo, one of the two siblings that started Kuobrothers, IPO’d in 2016. Jerry then IPO’d a second company that grew out of the original Kuobrothers Group, called MobiX, earlier this year.</p>

<p>There’s also M17, started by Singaporean Joseph Phua. M17 started as a dating app company called Paktor and was based in Singapore. Joseph merged that company with a Taiwanese company called 17 Media to form what is fast becoming a massive social entertainment company that focuses on live-streaming. A recent acquisition of competitor MeMe Live has brought M17’s live stream market share to over 60 per cent in SEA’s developed markets. That wasn’t the only M17 procurement, though.</p>

<p>M17 bought AppWorks Accelerator alum FBbuy, a company that developed an innovative way for people to buy items on Facebook. If someone simply typed in “+1,” in a comment, the scanning app would move the coveted item being discussed into a shopping cart. Joseph acquired that company and integrated it into a live-streaming commerce app called HandsUp.</p>

<h2>Early-stage is also heading to Taiwan</h2>

<p>There are also a number of early-stage companies with inherent exposure to SEA who have heeded the call to come to Taiwan.</p>

<p>At our upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45764" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45764">Demo Day #19</a>, over 65 per cent of the cohort will have originated or started their startup ideas in GSEA. Two female founders offer some examples.</p>

<p>Annie Zhang, from Hong Kong, will pitch Matters Lab as a decentralised platform for media and content sharing, which enables content providers to generate their own immutable content and get paid for it. They’ve generated about 25,000 customers in seven months.</p>

<p>Telepod founder Jin-Ni Gan, a Malaysian living in Singapore, will also pitch. At a recent mentor day, she showed off her miniEV startup already operating in seven markets in the region.</p>

<p>Her last slide was a photo of kids without shoes walking down a dirt road that cut through what looked like smoke from a jungle fire at a rubber plantation.</p>

<p>“My childhood was similar to this one,” she said, and then ended her pitch with the message that tech and creativity have a strong potential to make this life better for billions of people.</p>

<p>That’s a story that is familiar to many founders here in Taiwan, and it’s one that will only scale rapidly in time. As the region grows, the probability that mission-driven founders who are intent on building fast-moving scalable startups will see that Taiwan is a launchpad for the regional market.</p>

</div>

<p>Another quick look at the GSEA market landscape should give founders, and investors, something to think about.</p>

<p>Out of the five countries mentioned earlier that have GDP growth north of 6 per cent, three of them — Cambodia, Laos, and East Timor — have mobile internet penetration rates under 40 per cent.</p>

<p>Myanmar, which has 21 million Internet users, only provides Internet to 36 per cent of its population. Nearly all of those users — 99.8 per cent — get their Internet through mobile phones.</p>

<p>In emerging market economies, a glut of software and tech availability is enabling founders to test use cases for new technology and consumer products. Often, these use cases employ leapfrog innovations that are further ahead than the traditional infrastructure or tech use cases in developed markets.</p>

<p>After spending six months in Taiwan, XFers (#18) teamed up with Zilliqa in Singapore to launch a stablecoin. The lack of avenues for remittances makes the mobile form factor an attractive device for gaining access to capital and tapping into new virtual banks and blockchain technologies. Going forward , data seems to indicate that this innovation in SE Asia driven by a connection to Taiwan will be more prevalent. And it will continue to shape fintech and more.</p>

Now, let’s take a look at people — in Taiwan’s startup teams.</p>
<p>Founders who blaze new trails and launch their ventures may be the first to pop into your head, but the significance of other team members cannot be downplayed, says <a title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2015/11/04/why-the-wider-team-are-crucial-to-start-up-success/#2422406d6e4f" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2015/11/04/why-the-wider-team-are-crucial-to-start-up-success/#2422406d6e4f">Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a title="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-post-mortem/" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-post-mortem/">CB Insights</a> has asked 323 founders, investors, and journalists about why they think startups flame out. The result <a title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2019/05/01/why-start-ups-fail/#5a0a971228a5" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniselyohn/2019/05/01/why-start-ups-fail/#5a0a971228a5">reveals</a> that out of top 20 reasons for failure, seven are related to people and/or company culture whereas only two are about money. In other words, the success of a startup hinges much on its team as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>So, what do Taiwan&#8217;s startup teams look like?</strong></p>
<p>From Aug. 1 to Sep. 18, 2019, Business Next (BNext) has surveyed 231 startup founders, co-founders, and senior managers in Taiwan about the companies they found or work for. It receives 211 valid responses and serves as a crucial basis for BNext’s annual report on Taiwan’s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Among all the surveyed founders, more than half (54.9%) are first-time entrepreneurs. 45.1％ are serial entrepreneurs and almost all of them have 5+ years of work experience.</p>
<p>The average number of members in a founding team is 4.48, while 18 among all the startups are run by only one founder.</p>
<p>34.3% of the members are women, making the ratio between male and female members approximately 2:1. 63 startups are founded by an all-male team.</p>
<p>The average age for all the members in a founding team stands at 34.65, with 23.5 being the youngest and 55 being the oldest among all. The former works on digital ads and the latter is a software company focusing on information security.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of responsibilities, more than half of the members (2.25 out of 4.48) work on the tech side.</strong></p>
<p>Louis Chang, Founder of NewsLeopard, says there were only two people in the team back when he started the company, so he had to work as a developer. It’s a Taiwan-based startup developing a namesake email marketing platform.</p>
<p>Tech background enables him to release minimum viable product (MVP) for market validation with the least possible resources, but this can divert his attention away from understanding what the market really needs, he says.</p>
<p>Cornerstone Ventures co-founder TP Lin tells Business Next he believes tech capability is important but not the only element that pushes startups to success. Business model, core competency, and growth plan are no less pivotal. “It would be great if co-founders have different backgrounds and complement each other,” he says.</p>
<p>When asked about the type of employees their company plans to recruit in the future, they give answers that reflect the known demand of tech talent in the startup scene: 30.8% would like to hire more software developers while 18.9%, 17%, and 14.2% want to bring in BD, marketing, and sales specialists, respectively.</p>
<p>The average size of the entire team, including the founding team, is 20.45. Each team tends to hire 2 to 3 interns.</p>
<p>Most startup teams target three vertical markets: B2B solutions (14.2%), AI/data analytics (13.7%), and e-commerce (11.8%). Other include education (8%) and marketing/PR (7.5%).</p>
<p>Around 40% of the surveyed teams serve enterprises (B2B business) and the rest serves end customers either directly (B2C business, 27.4%) or indirectly (B2B2C business, 28.9%).</p>
<p>60% of the startups have launched their product(s), but overall, there are still 47.3% struggling with deficits. Only 33.1% of them have been making profit and expecting steady growth.</p>

<p>Founded in 2009, AppWorks has run its six-month accelerator program for almost a decade and built a global network of 376 active startups and 1,113 founders. It has started to recruit only startups focusing on AI and blockchain technologies since last year.</p>

<p>“The twice a year AppWorks Demo Days have always been the go-to event for investors and corporate leaders to witness firsthand the development of cutting-edge technologies and their business applications that have a GSEA (Great Southeast Asia, the region encompassing Taiwan and ASEAN countries) twist as well as meeting future startup stars,” AppWorks Chairman and Partner Jamie Lin said at the opening of the event.</p>

<p>AppWorks believes “the founder-focused showcase underpins the case that Taiwan as a startup hub is an integral component of this growth region.”</p>

<p>Lin further points out the potential of GSEA and what it means for Taiwan: “Within only 18 months, AppWorks alumni have expanded their presence in GSEA 1.6x, testimony that the accelerator and the country are a launchpad for founders driving business change in a region where population growth is rising 3.5x the pace in Greater China.”</p>

<p>AppWorks says all of the founders who pitched on the event have demonstrated considerable traction in their markets and many have used Taiwan as a launchpad for potential accelerated growth throughout the entire GSEA region.</p>

<p>Here are the startups from its 19th batch:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Telepod (Singapore): urban mobility with a network of swappable battery kiosks.</li>

The first closing is led by Silicon Valley-headquartered venture capital firm SOSV, Uni-President Group, and Kyber Capital.</p>
<p>For Uni-President Group, the giant Taiwanese food conglomerate company, BigGo is its second internet investment after the investment in Sea Group, Shopee&#8217;s parent company, in 2017.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley–headquartered venture capital firm SOSV reinvests. BigGo graduated from MOX Batch 3, an SOSV accelerator for cross-border mobile internet. &#8220;MOX, the Mobile Only Accelerator operated by SOSV helps startups from around the world expand cross border into new markets without spending money on customer acquisition,&#8221; says <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45342" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45342">William Bao Bean</a>, General Partner at SOSV and Managing Director at MOX. &#8220;We have been happy to help BigGo launch into Thailand and hit profitability and excited to see them enter Japan and other SE Asia markets next.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Kyber Capital, a global blockchain and financial innovation venture fund, this is the first time investing in the internet industry. Kyber Capital founder Thomas Hu says, &#8220;Kyber sees great prospects in BigGo&#8217;s product vision and development strategy in the vertical search engine category, as well as monetization potential by combining decentralized fintech with big data on BigGo&#8217;s platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>BigGo plans to use the funds to further product development and to expand internationally in markets such as Thailand, Japan, and the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2020, we expect to see a 300% increase in revenue from this year. We also expect a substantial increase in users from 11 million to 25 million users,&#8221; says Kevin Yen, CEO of BigGo.</p>
<p>BigGo currently sells more than 4,500 Shopee orders per day, with a record high of more than 10,000 orders in a single day. Many e-commerce companies experience substantial increases in conversions and revenue growth of their products on the BigGo platform.</p>
<p>BigGo business includes price comparison, cashback, offline price comparison, price history tracking, and extension services. The platform is available in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Thai.</p>
<p><strong>BigGo offers historical price tracking features and price reduction alerts.</strong></p>
<p>BigGo&#8217;s historical price tracking feature allows users to track any product&#8217;s pricing history for up to 90 days. Users can subscribe to price alerts and receive notifications in real-time when pricing has changed, ensuring great buying opportunities will never be missed.</p>
<p><strong>The browser extension helps users to buy the best price.</strong></p>
<p>BigGo Helper is a browser extension that will automatically notify and display available discount codes on the checkout page of participating e-commerce sites, BigGo Helper browser extension is available on Chrome and Firefox browsers.</p>
<h2>The Next Step for BigGo</h2>
<p>BigGo started its international expansion launching BigGo Thai in November 2018. Since launching, it has become the top price comparison website in Thailand with an Alexa website traffic ranking of 124 for all websites in Thailand. BigGo has recently entered into a partnership with Thairath, Thailand&#8217;s largest news and media with 25M monthly active users and 160M monthly pageviews, to accelerate its growth in the Thai market.</p>
<p>In August 2019, BigGo launched BigGo Japan and has formed a strategic alliance with Japanese e-commerce consultant BlueGoose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, most online price-comparison aggregator websites still rely on merchants for pricing and product updates, however relying on merchant updates is not sustainable with the sheer volume of products and online merchants that exist across the Internet. BigGo&#8217;s proprietary search engine technology automatically captures the latest product and pricing across the entire Internet. We then are able to present the best online comparison shopping deals for our users,&#8221; says Kevin Yen, Founder and CEO of BigGo.</p>
<p>&#8220;BigGo&#8217;s vision has always been to solve problems for our online shoppers and to become the world&#8217;s biggest price comparison website.”</p>

Just this year, Taoyuan also outshined nearly 400 other cities to be named as the Intelligent Community of the Year by Intelligent Community Forum (ICF).</p>', '5e1/010/e5b/5e1010e5b11a7462066523.png', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

It’s partly based on a survey of 231 startup founders, co-founders and senior managers, among whom 211 contribute valid responses.</p>
<p>By comparison, 2017 has seen an influx of funds valued at $426m in total, among which $295m goes to Gogoro and $71m goes to Appier and M17 together. Last year, Taiwan startups have raised $49m, a little less than this year.</p>

<p>KKday and iKala have raised approximately $10m — the largest sum of investment this year — in January and August, respectively. The latter is funded in Series A and a follow-on round.</p>
<p>Angel investors have been particularly active this year. For example, NCTU (National Chiao Tung University) Angel Club participates in MoBagel’s Series A round and Boncha Boncha’s pre-A round, and TMYTEK, iDrip and Citpo are invested by the National Development Fund (NDF) under its Business Angel Investment Program.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, the survey reveals that Taiwan startups are mostly funded at the early stages this year, from seed, angel, to Series A round. Only 1.3% of them are funded in Series B round and after.</strong></p>
<p>Series B round funding is all about expanding market reach to succeed on a larger scale, according to Investopedia. This finding seems to suggest that Taiwan startups need to further validate their business models to prove to VCs that they’re prepared to take their business to the next level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 48.8% of the surveyed startups have never approached any VCs (22.7% have reached out to 1-3 VCs) and 70.1% haven’t participated in any accelerator program — a sign that a huge proportion of startups have been standing on their own feet.</p>
<p>Y Combinator, AppWorks, Microsoft for startups, and AAMA Taipei Cradle Program, in order, are the accelerator programs the surveyed startups want to join the most.</p>
<h2>The rise of corporate venture capital</h2>
<p>According to Taiwania’s white paper, among 729 investments in Taiwan startups from 2015 to August this year, CVCs (corporate venture capitals) take the lead in 414 cases, around 52% of the total, higher than traditional VCs in 380 cases (48%).</p>
<p>The National Development Fund and foreign investors participate in 17% and 14% of the cases, respectively.</p>
<p>Examples include the $5m investment of Wistron’s VC arm in MoBagel and $8m investment of Shin Kong Security in Umbo CV.</p>

<p>In fact, a number of enterprises in Taiwan have had a clear enough plan on how to invest in startups: Wistron appropriates 10% of the annual R&amp;D budget for startup investments, Advantech and Flytech start from running a corporate accelerator program with StarFab, and Chunghwa Telecom, the largest in Taiwan, works with e-commerce giant PChome to invest in early stage startups with their joint VC fund worth $13m (NT$400m).</p>
<p>The government has also funded multiple startups this year, primarily through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program (Ministry of Economics), Project of Subsidies &amp; Incentives for Taipei Industry (Taipei city government), and Business Angel Investment Program (NDF).</p>

The answer can easily be yes, given that famous examples like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin and Larry Page all launched their world-changing business at a young age, several in their teens and most in their twenties.</p>
<p>The association between young age and success has been so common that the founder of Y Combinator Paul Graham once jested that “the cutoff in investors’ heads is 32… After 32, they start to be a little skeptical.” Is that true?</p>
<p>According to a <a title="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/age-of-successful-entrepreneurs/" href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/age-of-successful-entrepreneurs/">joint research project</a> by MIT Sloan, UPenn Wharton, U.S. Census Bureau and National Bureau of Economic Research, the average age of successful entrepreneurs is indeed 45. Statistics indicate middle-aged entrepreneurs tend to be more successful; those in their fifties are 2.5 times more likely to succeed than their 20-something counterparts. An older entrepreneur can potentially bring better return for venture capitalists as well.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, there seems to be a deep impression that startups are all led by youngsters and college dropouts. This can be wrong again.</p>
<p>In a survey of around 200 Taiwanese startup (co-)founders by Business Next, 39.8% and 60.1% of them are now above 41 and 36. On average, they were around 38 years old when they started their company.</p>
<p>This survey, conducted from Aug. 1 to Sep. 18, 2019, is part of Business Next’s annual report on Taiwan’s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Female startup (co-)founders account for 20.8% of the surveyed, and 47% of them are above 41 — a percentage much higher than that of male (co-)founders.</p>
<p>Before diving into their ventures, 81% of the (co-)founders in their forties have 10+ years of work experience while 86.9% of all the surveyed have at least 3 years of work experience.</p>
<p>Industry experience fuels startup success, as revealed by the aforementioned research project. (Co-)founders with 3 years of work experience are 85% more likely to succeed than those who start from zero.</p>
<p>Among all the surveyed, 46.4% have master’s degree while 9.9% have PhD. In the 41+ year old demographic, these figures are much higher: 63% have master’s degree while 14.2% have PhD.</p>
<p>In terms of their educational background, 34.5% studied electrical engineering/computer science, 33.1% studied business, and 22.7% studied other fields of science and engineering, followed by 13.2% majoring in marketing and 10.9% in literature, art and design.</p>

<p>Besides speaker talks and panel discussion, there was also live demo tables on-site with 5G instrument solutions for cellular V2X from Rohde &amp; Schwartz and 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) test solution from TMYTEK, a Taiwan start-up company who has invented an innovative fast-scan and low-effective approach for 5G mmWave production test along with antenna validation and other test functions in R&amp;D lab. 5G mmWave, operating in high frequency, impose a variety of challenges including testability due to huge path loss from beamforming and difficulty in module-based 5G mmWave over-the-air (OTA) testing. TMYTEK’s mmWave experts have come up with a solution that solves this known problem in the wireless industry.</p>

<p>As a high-profile event bridging the cross-border exchange between Silicon Valley and Taiwan high-tech communities, UTHF has become the flagship event for individuals working in large companies, start-ups as well as entrepreneurs and investors alike. Moreover, it interconnects Silicon Valley, world’s leading innovation hub, with Taiwan’s vibrant new technological advancements to the global stage. It is certainly a conference that should not be missed for anyone looking to deepen understanding of industry trends or to build stronger ties between U.S. and Taiwan technology communities.</p>

<p>This is one of the main reasons that brought him back to the island where he was born. Compared with doing video chats in Silicon Valley with leaders from Taiwan, “it’s another thing to actually be here,” he said, to know what it’s really like in the startup community here.</p>

<p>“One of the things I imagine doing in the next months is to try to create something here in Taiwan,” said Chen.</p>

<p>Drawing on his experience in Paypal’s 12-person team with the goal of building a global P2P payment service, Chen encouraged startups to “always think outside of the 23 million people in Taiwan.”</p>

<p>He also called for “an environment friendly to failure” and “a spirit that gets everyone to work together” as in the Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>As it becomes more and more difficult to launch a startup in the Silicon Valley, “it’s great time for Taiwan to step up,” he said. With lower cost of living and employable engineers, it’s much easier to do so in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Last week, at the first ever Talent Circulation Summit, AIT Director William Brent Christensen said such success can be largely attributed to talent circulation: those who studied and worked in the US brought what they learned back to Taiwan and fueled the economy by either starting new companies or offering support to existing ones.</p>

<p>Morris Chang, Founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Company (TSMC), is representative of the global talent he described that pushed Taiwan’s economic progress from the 80s. As a speaker at the Summit, he shared with the audience that his 36 years in the US equipped him with a global vision, and it’s the most valuable asset he gained from the experience. “And you learn to be modest when you know the world is huge and there are a lot of talented people,” he argued.</p>

<p>In Chang’s view, talent circulation between Taiwan and the US is the root cause for the global chipmaker’s success as well.</p>

<p><strong>One of the objectives for the Talent Circulation Alliance (TCA), the organizer of the Summit, is to replicate such story of success, according to Director Christensen. The Alliance, working with partners in the public and private sector, academia, and civil society, both in Taiwan and across the globe, seeks to facilitate the circulation of talent between Taiwan and like-minded countries.</strong></p>

<p>The TCA also seeks to help internationally integrate and digitally upgrade Taiwan’s industry and talent to help further its transition to an innovation-based economy, Director Christensen said.</p>

<p>The overall goal, he said, is to internationalize Taiwan’s workforce for the digital age.</p>

<h2>Cultivating internationally-oriented talent in Taiwan</h2>

<p>For many, Taiwan’s prosperity, starting from the 80s, doesn’t seem to last until today. “Since that time, there has been a perception that Taiwan has started to lag,” Leo Seewald, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham Taipei), said. Despite its burgeoning tech industry, it seems to have been “discounted.”</p>

<p>But some see Taiwan’s future differently. A number of well-known international companies, including Google and Apple, have flocked to Taiwan recently to invest and set up operations.</p>

<p>“The concern is how young people here get involved and position themselves that they can work for these companies,” Mr. Seewald added.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, the core issue is indeed how Taiwan can cultivate internationally-oriented talent to push itself forward as in the past.</p>

<p>Randall Nadeau, CEO of Fulbright Taiwan, said he believes helping students to study aboard facilitates the process because it unlocks the possibility of “experiential learning,” which simulates creativity and broadens horizons. His foundation provides grants for students and scholars from Taiwan to do educational exchange in the US and vice versa.</p>

<p>Talent cultivation and circulation are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, said Mr. Seewald.</p>

<p>In the recent years, an educational reform based on a shift of “knowledge-based to competency-based model has been rolled out, said Anting Liu, Founder of Teach for Taiwan. She gave recognition to such move, noting that Taiwanese students will thus be able to leverage their creativity and put what they’ve learnt into practice. In her organization, she also allows student volunteers to develop leadership through teaching kids in rural schools.</p>

<p>Drawing on her background in leadership and neuroscience, Britt Andreatta, CEO of 7th Mind, pointed out the importance of developing emotional intelligence. “It’s about knowing yourself and managing yourself, and once you do that well, that makes you better at understanding others, building relationships and influencing others,” she said.</p>

<p>She also suggested that everyone set aside a couple of hours a week for creativity, working on change, or developing themselves as a leader.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Nadeau said cross-disciplinary learning is another key to cultivating oneself. “For every person who wants to make a difference, the best advice I can give is to develop your curiosity, to want to know about anything,” he said.</p>

<p>One should think about what they can do with their own mind. It’s about not only “crossing international boundaries, but also crossing intellectual boundaries,” he said.</p>

<h2>Making Taiwan a magnet for international talent</h2>

<p>While opening possibilities for the Taiwanese to go abroad, it’s crucial to make their hometown a better location for personal growth and career development, which will attract not only them to return and bring back new perspectives but also foreign talent to stay and contribute to the economy. This is in line with another objective that the TCA is working on: to prevent brain drain in Taiwan.</p>

<p>With the declining birth rate and aging population, it should be one of the top priorities for the country to remain competitive in the digital era, said Mr. Seewald.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ms. Liu said she has always felt a sense of pessimism among Taiwanese young people over the country’s future; she encourages a shift in mindset.</p>

<p>“If you flip the map counterclockwise, you see a very different perspective. You start to see Taiwan at the center, especially in the digital era, of some of the biggest markets and opportunities from Japan to Indonesia,” she said. “If we liberate ourselves from some of the psychological limitations we put on ourselves, there are great opportunities in Taiwan.”</p>

<p>“That needs to live in the hearts and minds of the people who are here,” Ms. Andreatta responded. “Because as you start to see it, that energetically travels around the world.”</p>

<p>“People want to be where other people are happy and loving where they are and their experiences,” she added.</p>

<p>Further, Melissa Daimler, Principal of Daimler Partners, said it’s crucial that Taiwan define clearly and intentionally what it has that is nowhere else. It’s what differentiates itself from other cultures that attracts foreign talent to come here.</p>

<p>As a congresswoman for the ruling party, Karen Yu is working on policies that will practically encourage more foreign talent to work and live in Taiwan, including the Foreign Professionals Act that has come into effect last year. She said she will seek to further include in this Act not only the program that allows foreigners to do internship in Taiwan but one that facilitates the exchange between high tech companies overseas and local startups.</p>

This investment round is spearheaded by CDIB Capital Management, a leading VC firm in Taiwan with a market share of over 30%.</p>
<p>With the new fund, the Taiwanese startup is to focus on strengthening its R&amp;D capability and expanding in overseas markets, i.e., Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>The three-year-old company offers bespoke cloud solutions and consulting services to all scales of business by leveraging the power of AI, machine learning, and big data analytics. As a partner of Google Cloud, for example, it has helped traditional businesses implement AI technology in their workflow. Several months earlier, it has announced entry into Hong Kong.</p>
<p>With the experience of serving 300+ clients in more than ten industries in Taiwan and Hong Kong, CloudMile has aimed higher. CEO Spencer Liu said next year, the company plans to enter Singapore, where it will break ground on a new headquarter.</p>
<p>He said Singapore has been taking the lead in Asia&#8217;s AI market and establishing headquarter operations here will help CloudMile better keep up with the global trend of tech development. The company is now in transition as it adapts to operational and technical teams built locally.</p>
<p>Ryan Kuo, Deputy General Manager of CDIB Capital Management, said as a platform for startups, the VC firm is optimistic about CloudMile’s capability of providing premium AI and cloud services and believe as CloudMile expands its market in Asia, its AI services will assist more Asian enterprises in innovating their business models. He is looking forward to putting another Taiwanese startup on the global stage.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, CloudMile plans to set up an R&amp;D center devoted to AI technology, especially for gaming, healthcare and retail industries. Liu pointed out that Taiwan&#8217;s healthcare has been considered one of the best in the world, and he hopes to introduce AI to more local startups in this industry and help them expand their global presence.</p>
<p>This year has seen the company buckle down to develop new products for brand owners. With mlytics, it has launched MileCDN, a new multi content delivery network (multi-CDN) platform that optimizes website performance and user experience with enhanced data security.</p>

<p>Initiated in 2005 as a sequel to the Human Genome Project, the 13-year effort to determine the DNA sequence of human genome from beginning to end, PGP aims to collect genome, health, and trait data from 100 thousand participants across the globe to create an open database for scientists to unravel the relationship between human genetics and diseases.</p>
<p>With such database, they are able to come up with solutions to eliminate inherited diseases by sequencing genomes at an acceptably low cost, Mr. Church said. The cost has been plummeting over the past three decades, from some billion to a few hundred US dollars.</p>
<p>The global network of this project so far includes Canada, Austria, China, and the UK, each of which operates independently as a member in a loose confederation. &#8220;We want to have independent lines of language, customs, and laws to be country personalized,&#8221; Mr. Church said. &#8220;It&#8217;s crucial that every country be represented.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is therefore optimistic about Taiwan&#8217;s participation in the project, which shouldn&#8217;t be hampered by the size of the country. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t require a lot of money and people but innovation and sharing of ideas,&#8221; he said. With its genetic and environmental diversity, Taiwan may add value to the network and make great contributions to the development of precision medicine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he referred to PGP as a &#8220;technology-sensitive project,&#8221; for which one might expect Taiwan, as one of the leading countries in the global ICT industry, can leverage its strength.</p>
<p>Academia Sinica, National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), and several top universities in Taiwan have been planning to form an alliance for a PGP-Taiwan initiative, Chuang Woei-jer, a medical science professor at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and a former director-general of the Department of Life Sciences at the MOST, according to <a title="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/11/03/2003725171" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/11/03/2003725171">Taipei Times</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Church has also promised to visit Taiwan again next year to sign an agreement with the alliance, he said.</p>
<h2>From lab to world of business</h2>
<p>In fact, Mr. Church isn&#8217;t only a scholar and professor of MIT and Harvard but also a profilic entrepreneur who has founded 20+ startups, including <a title="https://nebula.org/" href="https://nebula.org/">Nebula Genomics</a>. His Boston lab, likewise, is more than a space for research but an incubator of startup ideas.</p>
<p>He told Business Next that it&#8217;s an environment where it&#8217;s okay to fail and be disorganized; &#8220;mediocrity is the enemy,&#8221; he said. In such lab culture, central to numerous sucesses he witnesses there, members regard experimentation as a part of their life and commit to thinking outside the box, he added.</p>
<p>Rather than following the sometimes overhyped technology trends created by investors, Mr. Church said he and his team monetize only the ideas and applications that are truly needed by the market.</p>
<p>New-born startups in the lab earn his two to three years of full attention &#8212; until the founders, also his students, are able to run the business independently and think he&#8217;s not necessary anymore, he laughed.</p>
<p>As many of them become a success, a positive feedback has been created: &#8220;all the previous students will come back and help their younger sibilings,&#8221; Mr. Church said. He described it as &#8220;a four-year-old [teaching] a two-year-old how to run,&#8221; but it&#8217;s an effective way for them to learn from each other. With this wonderful family, one can probably see one more startup success emerging from his lab sooner or later.</p>

In cooperation with NiCE (National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association), the “2019 Taiwan Startup Ecosystem Survey X Start up Scale Up in Southern Taiwan” event was held at ICCK (International Convention Center Kaohsiung) on 31st October.</p>

<p>The event focused on the discussion and comparison of the background and needs of the entrepreneurs of Southern Taiwan in the survey results. In terms of industrial development, Southern Taiwan was dominated by green energy and the IoT (Internet of Things), while north region was dominated by digital media, IoT and e-commerce, and the central part concentrated on smart manufacturing, green energy technology and new agriculture. In addition, the host invited incubator managers from Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung and Taitung to participate. It also shared the government resources and the results of the southern entrepreneurship ecosystem at the booths. Furthermore, the TSH (Taiwan Start-up Hub) set up a helpdesk for providing consulting services for the guests of the event.</p>

<p>There was one thing worth noting that manufacturers were mainly concentrated in Southern Taiwan, whether it was high-tech industries, heavy industries and other traditional industries all had huge output values. Since the intellectualization had become a global manufacturing trend nowadays, the panel discussion session focused on how to assist the upgrading of the local industries, including the strategic thinking of digital upgrading and development, and how the manufacturing industry should cooperate with the startups. The speakers included the director of Sivann Inc. – Simen Lee, the chairman of Macroblock Inc. – Lichang Yang, LED, and the chairman of Wellgen Medical – Yusen Lin. It created business opportunities for enterprises and interactions for the participants.</p>

<p>Southern Taiwan is now in the critical period of industrial transformation and upgrading, while the SMEs play an important role in economic growth. “SMEA will continue to integrate central, local and private entrepreneurial resources in the future, and strive to provide diversified financial support, tax incentives and international markets connections for startups.”, said Betty Hu, the deputy director general of SMEA.</p>', '5e2/159/4fe/5e21594fe7b3e592934681.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2020-01-17 06:51:01', null);

Jerry Peng, CEO of <a title="https://tradingvalley.com" href="https://tradingvalley.com/">Trading Valley</a> started his presentation to Business Next about his Fintech startup with an appalling figure. This is the market he chooses to explore and it&#8217;s enormous not only in size but in potential.</p>
<p>Think about why people would rather save up than invest. It&#8217;s not only that they tend to believe investing exposes them to risks and uncertainty but that they shy away from traditional financial advisors, which charge a high wealth management fee without guaranteeing returns.</p>
<p>But for ordinary people, probably laymen in investing, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to invest on their own while ensuring stable returns, too. They often struggle to pick the types of assets to invest in, let alone forming a portfolio.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Trading Valley develops an AI-powered robo-advisor to help people make wiser investment decisions and, as Mr. Peng said, &#8220;to bring technology to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup uses an AI model to extract and analyze a huge amount of financial data, including volume-price trends and financial reports available on the Internet, to forecast 18 markets across the globe with more than 70% accuracy. &#8220;We don&#8217;t adopt human perspective (from economists, for example) but have AI technology identity the patterns for us,&#8221; he added. This is a bit different from its competitor Betterment, an NY-based online investment company.</p>
<p>With such technology, Trading Valley works with second-tier banks to offer customized, automated investment services to their clients based on their financial goal and acceptable level of risk in Taiwan. The trained AI model picks out a number of individual stocks, ETFs, and regular funds to ensure 5 to 9 percent annual return. In the US, as a licensed online advisor, they develop strategies for excess return directly for high-end clients; despite a high risk, an annual return from 8 to 20 percent can be expected.</p>
<p>This year, the Taiwanese startup has been selected for the accelerator in Australia: Startupbootcamp Fintech Melbourne. It opens the door for the company to tap into the market in Australia and work with the National Australia Bank (NAB), one of the four largest local financial institutions. Later, it hopes to collaborate with not only banks but securities dealers and asset management centers there. The goal, Mr. Peng said, has been to drive the wave with digital transformation in the financial sector.</p>
<p>At the earliest, Trading Valley will start fundraising (pre-A funding) at the end of 2019 to acquire more B2B clients.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('Business chat tool Chatwork, after Tokyo IPO, looks to grow footprint in Taiwan and Asia', '2019-10-31', 'news', '<p><a title="https://go.chatwork.com/" href="https://go.chatwork.com/">Chatwork</a>, having secured a dominant market share (70%)* in Japan, arrived at Taiwan three years ago as its first attempt to expand the software business overseas.</p>
<p>Launched in 2011, the Japanese company develops a namesake instant messaging app for businesses with less than 300 employees. Users can not only send messages to each other but also manage tasks, share files, and make video calls. Unlike its major competitor Slack, it&#8217;s a people-centric platform that allows them to create and be added into groups as on Facebook.</p>
<p>Business Next had talked with the general manager of the Taiwan branch Masafumi Kawamura back in 2016, more than one year after the parent company welcomed an influx of third-party capital: ¥300M ($3M) from GMO Venture Partners and ¥1.5B ($15M) from GMO Venture Partners, SHINSEI, JAFCO, and SMBC Venture Capital, all of which are from Japan.</p>
<p><strong>This year, Chatwork has got nod of approval for initial public offering (IPO) at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in September. Its shares are listed and traded on Mothers, a TSE section for startups.</strong></p>
<p>CFO Naoki Inoue told us that going public may strengthen the company&#8217;s presence in the global market and help them build trust with clients, and these two benefits are mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p>The trust from clients is particularly crucial for an messaging app like Chatwork as it involves the issue of privacy. &#8220;Our mission is to ensure that our communication platform is one that users feel safe while using,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Following its well-supported IPO, the goal for the firm has been clear enough: besides 90% of the efforts in Japan, it expects to grow footprint in other Asian countries, according to <a title="https://jp.techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/chatwork-listed-on-tse-mothers/" href="https://jp.techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/chatwork-listed-on-tse-mothers/">TechCrunch</a>. And they are, for now, Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Vietnam branch was founded in 2016 as well, when the company saw increasing number of Japanese businesses offshore jobs in one of the most fast-growing countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Mr. Inoue said It&#8217;s only after reaching &#8220;great success&#8221; in Asia will Chatwork proceed to Western markets including Europe and the US, in which the office had been temporarily shut down to ensure a smooth IPO; the marketing plan in the US wasn&#8217;t finalized despite five years of exploration. He defined such success as the time when Chatwork app sees high demand and its user base grows steadily.</p>
<h2>Chatwork&#8217;s three-year journey in Taiwan</h2>
<p>Mr. Kawamura, GM of the Taiwan branch, pointed out that while the clients in Japan are predominantly law and accounting firms, the majority of the users in Taiwan are employees from civil engineering and manufacturing companies, who pay Chatwork for the software service. The app can be used for the communication between factory workers and product designers, for instance.</p>
<p>The company has also started to see university clients employ its service in Taiwan to facilitate the communication between professors and students who work together at labs, as in Japan, where it has collaborated with some at Kyoto University.</p>
<p>Speaking of startups as a new target audience, Mr. Kawamura said the team hasn&#8217;t had the plan to reach out to this new group of clients. &#8220;But we are still interested in newly-established businesses from traditional industries,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>He believes Slack, as a tool designed at first for IT developers, may suit a large proportion of startups in Taiwan as most of them are tech companies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ChatWork has been localizing their product to create positive user experience and thus discovered some needs specific to Taiwan. For example, Mr. Kawamura said Taiwanese companies tend to ask to remove the function that enables users to edit and delete messages after posting them in the chatroom — one that is often desirable for their Japanese counterparts.</p>
<p>When asked about the biggest difference between corporate clients in these two countries, Mr. Kawamura said, with a chuckle, those in Taiwan make decisions more quickly. He now drops in on companies that have been utilizing ChatWork&#8217;s service for free, persuading them to pay to enjoy advanced functions and services.</p>

The gathering was also well attended by guests from foreign business chambers and representative offices, along with representatives of relevant government agencies.</p>
<p>Card holders told the gathering about their experience of living and working in Taiwan, and exchanged views face to face with the NDC deputy minister. A photo backdrop was set up at the entrance, where card holders could have their picture taken to share online with family and friends. An opening performance of well-known Taiwanese folk songs by the national orchestra added spirit and joy to the atmosphere of the occasion.</p>

<p><strong>Designed to cater to high-caliber international talent needed by Taiwan’s industries, the Employment Gold Card forms part of the government’s active initiative to attract foreign professionals with outstanding achievements or unique abilities in the fields of science &amp; technology, the economy, education, culture, the arts, sports, finance, law, and architectural design. Besides making it convenient for holders to find and change employment, the card also gives those working in Taiwan for the first time a three-year benefit of having income tax assessed on only half of the part of their salary above NT$3 million. These and other benefits serve as inducements for foreign special professionals to work and live in Taiwan.</strong></p>
<p>Since its launch in February 2018, this scheme has attracted high interest in applying for the card, and more than 465 cards have already been issued.</p>
<p>The NDC organized this get-together to increase opportunities for card holders to interact with each other in Taiwan, and to establish a platform for their communication with the government. Opening remarks were delivered by NDC Deputy Minister Kao, thanking attendees for their support, reiterating the government’s talent recruitment policy, and expressing the hope that card holders would be able to interact with each other more closely through the Facebook group established exclusively for them. She also asked attendees to help spread word about the Employment Gold Card to their family members, friends and colleagues outside Taiwan.</p>

<p>After her remarks, card holders in various fields ardently shared their motivations for coming to Taiwan, their experience of living here, and their suggestions for government policy. Then, everyone mingled in lively conversation, exchanging thoughts, taking photos together, and partaking of a fine afternoon tea, with the deputy minister and other officials passing a convivial afternoon in company with the guests.</p>
<p>In order to optimize the synergies of talent recruitment, enable more highly qualified foreigners to know about Taiwan’s work and living environment, and expand Taiwan’s international visibility, the NDC will continue to hold events like this for interaction and exchange, and to strengthen international publicity and promotion. We hope that, through such efforts, we will be able to attract more talented people from other countries to come to Taiwan to develop their careers, and induce more of the talented people in Taiwan to be willing to stay here.</p>

<p>Digital Transformation Association (DTA), an entity focusing on digital transformation for enterprises and promoting the government&#8217;s plan at the Startup Terrace, said it feels glad to gather support from BE Capital and Inspiring Super Ideas for the acceleration program as well. Its Chairman Jen-Ran Chen, now also Taiwan Ambassador-At-Large, said DTA shares the same vision with MassChallenge. &#8220;Facing various social and economic challenges, every government should work with enterprises, investors, and higher education institutes to train entrepreneurs that are able to drive innovation,&#8221; he said.</p>

SMEA said this explains that Taiwan has its appeal for tech startups across the globe.</p>
<p>Before the finalists eligible for the week-long bootcamp were announced earlier this month, 25 teams had taken part in a 4-month program in Taipei offering in-depth trainings, networking opportunities, and one-on-one mentoring sessions, as well as &#8220;access to ICT manufacturing healthcare, and agri-food resources&#8221; in Taiwan — what B2MC Taiwan hopes the selected startups to leverage to expand to the global market.</p>
<p>The finalists are 14 startups focusing on diverse areas (healthcare, clean tech, and social impact) and coming from all parts of the world (Canada, Denmark, France, India, Taiwan, and the US).</p>

<p>This is the first time for this longtime CEO to top the ranking, after taking #2 spot in 2018 and #3 spot in 2017. He has also been recognized on several Forbes listings, including Forbes 400, innovative leaders 2019, and global game changers 2016.</p>
<p>Born in Taiwan, Huang co-founded the California-based chipmaker NVIDIA in 2013. As HBR reported, the firm&#8217;s initial focus on GPU for video games has switched to IC for AI applications due to the rising demand for computers to perform sophisticated calculations at a higher speed. Since mid-2010s, these AI-enabled chips have been commonly seen in autonomous vehicles, drones, and other high-tech gadgets.</p>
<p>At Mobile World Congress Los Angeles this year, Huang unveiled Aerial, a software development kit that enables efficient 5G radio access networks on its GPU. He also rolled out a series of partnerships with Ericsson, Microsoft, and Red Hat to bolster the company&#8217;s role in 5G and edge computing, according to <a title="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/through-partnerships-and-a-new-software-toolkit-nvidia-looks-to-surf-the-5g-wave/" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/through-partnerships-and-a-new-software-toolkit-nvidia-looks-to-surf-the-5g-wave/">Techcrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Within three years, from 2015 to 2018, NVIDIA&#8217;s stock has soared 14-fold, an outstanding financial performance that puts its CEO on the first place of the ranking for best-performing CEOs.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s result is also based on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores; they determine 30% of the overall performance of a given leader, 10% more than in previous years.</p>
<p>To be more specific, according to <a title="https://blog.csrhub.com/harvard-business-review-best-performing-ceos-ranking-with-csrhub-esg-metrics" href="https://blog.csrhub.com/harvard-business-review-best-performing-ceos-ranking-with-csrhub-esg-metrics">CSRHub</a>, one of the two data firms that assist HBR with the ranking, ESG rating takes into account measures like company lobbying expenditures, the degree of disclosure on issues such as carbon use, and the presence of a sustainability officer at the company’s top level. The other firm Sustainalytics said the score &#8220;reflects risks created by working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huang said &#8220;NVIDIA didn’t change the world by changing what it does. Rather, it has earned the opportunity to change the world by doing things the world needs,&#8221; according to <a title="https://www.cloudwedge.com/geeks/geek-of-the-week-jensen-huang-ceo-of-nvidia/" href="https://www.cloudwedge.com/geeks/geek-of-the-week-jensen-huang-ceo-of-nvidia/">CloudWedge</a>.

A talk with MIT Professor Charlie Fine', '2019-10-23', 'news', '<p>Earlier this month, MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge (IIC) have organized its <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45542" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45542">Asia selection in Kaohsiung</a> and announced four out of twelve startups as regional winners who soon proceed to MIT to vie for the four final cash prizes, with which they will be able to fulfill their ideas and create more economic opportunities for moderate and low income earners.</p>
<p>On the same day, Business Next sat down with Professor Charlie Fine, one of the selection panel members, to discuss the entrepreneurial opportunities in Asia and how they are explored by local startups, including the twelve teams who has made it to the regional selection. As the President of Asia School of Business (ASB) in Kuala Lumpur, an MBA program institute in collaboration with MIT Sloan, he also shared his views on how Taiwan can possibly collaborate with Southeast Asian countries after building more connections.</p>
<h2>Entrepreneurship necessary for Asia and the world</h2>
<p>In Asia, the rapid economic growth has opened up numerous spaces for entrepreneurs to tap into the market.</p>
<p>Professor Fine said he sees a great number of &#8220;visionary and ambitious people&#8221; in the region such as Anthony Tan, co-founder of <a title="https://www.grab.com/sg/" href="https://www.grab.com/sg/">Grab</a>, as well.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the ride-hailing giant is the first homegrown unicorn in Southeast Asia. &#8220;My sense is that there are going to be dozens of Anthony Tans and unicorns,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, through providing alternative means of transportation, offers better mobility for people in Southeast Asia and render them more employable, which echoes the mission of the IIC to empower those who are left behind by global tech progress.</p>
<p>Instead of driving tech progress, entrepreneurs like Tan addresses the pressing social challenges that their society has been facing collectively. Professor Fine believes this is the form of entrepreneurship that should be &#8220;celebrated&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s necessary not only for Asia but also for the world plagued by climate change and rising sea level. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have entrepreneurial energy directed to those kinds of challenges, this planet is gonna be a much less possible place to live,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Giving recognition to entrepreneurs tackling the ensuing refugee crisis such as Aline Sara from <a title="https://natakallam.com/" href="https://natakallam.com/">NaTakallam</a>, he urged them to come up with solutions to avoid the detrimental outcome in the first place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreseeing the large number of young people entering the labor market in Asia in the upcoming years, he also expects local entrepreneurs and his ABS students to build big organizations and create jobs for them.</p>
<p>With an abundance of business opportunities, Asia will further unleash its potential if the countries in this region &#8220;collaborate with each other and learn from each other&#8217;s cultures,&#8221; Professor Fine stressed. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge benefit to Asia if countries get to know each other better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, in 2016, Taiwan has rolled out <a title="https://english.ey.gov.tw/nsp/" href="https://english.ey.gov.tw/nsp/">New Southbound Policy</a> to strengthen economic ties with Southeast Asia, South Asia and Australasia. Companies are encouraged and subsidized to set up operations throughout the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>While reducing trade reliance on China, the country seeks to build an collaborative relationship with these countries based on the foundation of mutual understanding. &#8220;[Taiwan&#8217;s government has] to work harder to get to know more about each government’s operations and each society’s culture and special characteristics in order to work effectively,” said Minister without portfolio John Deng, according to <a title="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2019/02/the-new-southbound-policy-in-a-new-context/" href="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2019/02/the-new-southbound-policy-in-a-new-context/">Taiwan Business Topics</a>.</p>
<h2>How can Southeast Asia and Taiwan collaborate</h2>
<p>As the Policy, which he described to be &#8220;encouraging,&#8221; Professor Fine is also promoting transnational collaborations within Asia in the form of school programs. His ABS students in Malaysia are required to team up with fellows from various cultural backgrounds and develop a project in yet another Asian country.</p>
<p>What they do, he said, is &#8220;building their network in Asia,&#8221; a seed that might grow into actual economic connections. He does believe Taiwan has to know these countries better.</p>
<p>When asked about how they can collaborate, he said Taiwanese companies should bring their industry experience and knowledge to Southeast Asia and run business there.</p>
<p>Amid limited availability of talent, the economic growth of the region is constrained despite great market potential. It&#8217;s probably an opportunity for Taiwan, &#8220;a talent rich nation,&#8221; to contribute, he said.</p>

With its connections with communities, industries and the global market, Startup Terrace has attracted at least 132 domestic and foreign accelerators and startups to move into it. The coming launch ceremony will showcase startups’ new and smart technologies and will present the fruits of startup operations in Startup Terrace, in which infinite creativity is shown for a futuristic city for startups.</p>
<p>Linking up with communities, industries and global markets, and giving startups strong, deep roots in Taiwan.<br />
Startup Terrace is the largest-scale startup village in Taiwan, and includes one joint innovation center as well as 15 international accelerators, making it the startup complex with the largest number of international accelerators in Taiwan. Its resident members also include 99 startup businesses from 10 countries. This entrepreneurs’ village offers both quality customized services in an entrepreneurial environment and the support needed for the process of setting up a startup, which allows startup teams to forge ahead towards their dreams without worries. Besides, through accelerated growth and the cooperation achieved via domestic and international links, the value of startups is enhanced and their dreams are given the best chance to soar.</p>
<p>Moreover, Startup Terrace also opens up an opportunity for resident businesses to conduct empirical experiments which link up and cooperate with industries in the surrounding areas within a 2-km radius. With the introduction of international accelerators which assist startups in expanding their global markets, members can connect with the global startup ecosystem. It is hoped that by virtue of linking up with three major players—communities, industries and global markets—the ideas and motivation of resident teams can be inspired and thus Taiwan can be connected to the global market, making it an important base for exchanges and collaboration between international startups.</p>
<p>Linking up with the concerted effort of guests, and lighting up the village’s launch with innovative applications<br />
The theme for the coming launch event is ‘Link’, which sounds like ‘Linkou’ — the name of the town where Startup Terrace is located. As indicated by the word ‘Link’, it is Startup Terrace’s determination to link up communities, industries and the global market. Additionally, in order to highlight the transformation of traditional industries and initiation of product applications realized by innovation and creativity, the launch ceremony will start with a performance by the Chio-Tian Folk Drums &amp; Art Troupe. Moreover, in response to the theme of the launch event, ‘Link’, the energy of participating guests, startup businesses and community residents will be connected and linked up to ‘Light up Linkuo and Link up Taiwan with the World’.</p>

They will then proceed to MIT to vie for the four final grand prizes of the competition.</p>
<p>Based at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy (IDE), the Challenge offers cash prizes to entrepreneurs across the world who have come up with solutions of four categories, ranging from skills development to financial inclusion, to empower those who are left behind by tech progress.</p>
<p>Twelve teams had been selected this year as regional finalists in Asia, one of the five regions where the ICC holds selection event. After pitching their ideas to a live audience, four regional winners were further chosen by the selection panel of regional leaders: <a title="https://www.youth4jobs.org/" href="https://www.youth4jobs.org/">Youth4Jobs</a> (job matching and skills training platform for underprivileged youth), <a title="https://natakallam.com/" href="https://natakallam.com/">NaTakallam</a> (online learning platform that matches refugees and language learners), <a title="http://innovisiontech.co/" href="http://innovisiontech.co/">Innovision</a> (e-learning device for the visually impaired), and <a title="http://www.asiainitiatives.org/" href="http://www.asiainitiatives.org/">Asia Initiatives</a> (digital currency to promote the social good).</p>
<p>The regional finalists come from various parts of Asia: India, Pakistan, Tonga, Myanmar and Lebanon. Through hosting this event, the LCY Education Foundation said it hopes to &#8220;bring global aspects into Taiwan&#8221; and &#8220;put Taiwan&#8217;s talent on the global stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, due to the change in demographic structure, there emerge a number of social issues in Taiwan that need to be addressed innovatively, including eldercare, rural education, and indigenous employment. The solutions from the regional finalists, the foundation believes, present an alternative way of thinking to tackle such issues.</p>
<p>Devin Cook, Executive Producer of the IIC, told Business Next that she feels &#8220;a real sense of optimism&#8221; in Taiwan. People believe they&#8217;re able to transform their life if they use technology in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;The excitement and focus on innovation and entrepreneurship that we&#8217;ve seen in Taiwan make it a perfect place to host the IIC,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>As an opening, Elisa Chiu, founder of CEO of Anchor Taiwan, explained why her team decided to delve into the topic of circular economy by pointing out a widely unknown fact: the country has silently achieved one of the highest recycling rates in the world where a meager 10 percent of the plastic waste is recycled. &#8220;We have a mature and robust recycling system,&#8221; she stressed. &#8220;I think maybe it&#8217;s something the world can learn from.&#8221;</p>
<div class="fb-quote fb_iframe_widget">
<div id="attachment_10246" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10246" class="wp-image-10246 size-full" src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="599" srcset="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-1.jpg 900w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-1-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10246" class="wp-caption-text">Elisa Chiu, founder and CEO of Anchor Taiwan / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p></div>
</div>
<p>She added that Taiwan also features a group of &#8220;hidden champions&#8221; leading in niche markets like Pou Chen, the world&#8217;s largest branded athletic and casual footwear manufacturer, that need stronger presence, hence the mission of the platform, &#8220;to bring the world to Taiwan through entrepreneurship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Numerous companies in Taiwan are also looking for international talent with whom they can come up with technical solutions to existing pain points. &#8220;The biggest issues in the world need more cross-border and cross-disciplinary collaborations,&#8221; she stated, and waste, the topic of the event, is one of them.</p>
<h2>A trash can preventing contaminated waste</h2>
<p>Charles Yhap, a serial social entrepreneur from Pittsburgh and the founder of <a title="https://cleanrobotics.com/" href="https://cleanrobotics.com/">CleanRobotics</a>, has developed a robotic trash can to approach the worsening problem. &#8220;There are plenty of under-explored opportunities in waste tech,&#8221; he said, encouraging would-be entrepreneurs to work on this area.</p>
<p>In fact, as he later pointed out, the size of global waste industry is $435B, and waste receptable market in the US alone is worth $12B, larger than the global market of wireless sensors, chipsets, and modules that most people think has a great potential.</p>
<div id="attachment_10247" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10247" class="wp-image-10247 size-full" src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="599" srcset="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-2.jpg 900w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10247" class="wp-caption-text">Charles Yhap, the founder of CleanRobotics / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p></div>
<p>But what prompted Yhap and his team to create this product, called Trashbot, is the confusing experience of sorting out recyclables. He recalled the time when he needed to throw the trash after eating at Wholefoods. &#8220;I stand there trying to figure out where to put my waste and feel like a dummy,&#8221; he described. &#8220;There&#8217;s gotta be a better way to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of people are lousy recyclers, and their poor practices cause contamination. &#8220;You give them two bins, landfill and recycling, they make the right choice 30% of the time,&#8221; Yhap laughed, though it&#8217;s a 50/50 shot. Although, for example, there are attempts to clean up contaminated recyclables in the US, they&#8217;re not successful either, and 80% of such waste still ends up in the landfill.</p>
<p>With AI, computer vision, and sensors, his Trashbot separates trash three times (90%) more accurately than human being, helping facilities like airports, stadiums, and universities sort recyclables from landfill waste. When the Trashbot is full, it changes color to signal its status and sends notification to an online dashboard and SMS to relevant personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;These types of buildings (their facility customers) are facing a confluence of pressures,&#8221; Yhap said, to recycle correctly, including zero waste goals, mounting landfill expenses, and the public hoping for more sustainability. &#8220;This trend is the world wants better recycling management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facility managers are therefore excited about this product, not only because of the costs it saves but the access to a large amount of data that wouldn&#8217;t be possible before. &#8220;They can start making data-driven decisions,&#8221; Yhap explained. &#8220;We are pulling the value not from commodities and the waste itself but from the insights that can be generated.&#8221; For example, they can craft sustainability strategies based on them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for small business owners, they won&#8217;t be fined by waste haulers for the contaminated waste their customers create. Trashbot enables a new layer of transparency that improves the B2B relationship.</p>
<p>Yhap said he believes the social good and profit model are &#8220;mutually reinforcing&#8221;, and he can lead people to a better future with his smart bin. This is in line with the view of Gordon Yu, VP &amp; CSO of <a title="https://www.evptechnology.com/" href="https://www.evptechnology.com/">EVP Technology</a>.</p>
<h2>A technology turning trash into fuel</h2>
<p>To begin with, Yu pointed out the problem resulting from contaminated waste again, but he isn&#8217;t fazed at all — because the system called R-ONE developed by his team can turn it into a better type of fuel, which not only costs the same as petroleum-based diesel but produces less emission. With higher combustion efficiency, it also increases horsepower for vehicles without generating black smoke.</p>
<div id="attachment_10248" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10248" class="wp-image-10248 size-full" src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="599" srcset="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3.jpg 900w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://startup.sme.gov.tw/wp-content/uploads/1081007-3-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10248" class="wp-caption-text">Gordon Yu, VP &amp; CSO of EVP Technology / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p></div>
<p>Yu&#8217;s company, EVP technology, now processes over 25 tons of plastic waste every day and generates seven kiloliters of regenerative energy. It contains 10 ppm sulfur, much lower than the fuel used in ships (10,000 ppm). &#8220;We are making the air 1,000 times cleaner,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the system, 80% of the plastic waste can be converted into eco-friendly diesel for sale instead of being burnt in incinerator and generating dioxin while the rest serves as the fuel for the system to run without relying on external power supply. &#8220;The result is zero waste and zero emission,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;there&#8217;s no need to do cleaning and sorting.&#8221; Cleaning contaminated plastic materials can cause secondary pollution, and sorting is not only difficult to the majority but meaningless when plastics will be veritably recycled only if they&#8217;re clean.</p>
<p>Despite waste segregation, all types of trash can still end up together in the landfill, he added. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to reach sustainability without profit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>EVP manages to strike a balance between the social good and profitability. Indeed, if Taiwan&#8217;s government allows their &#8220;unconventional&#8221; oil to be branded and enter the diesel market, he believes they will work closely with corporates like Formosa Plastics and CPC Corporation (the state-owned petroleum company) and no plastic waste will be seen in Taiwan anymore.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been promoting biodiesel since 2008. This type of fuel is sourced from low quality oil like used cooking oil, and has thus brought about numerous complaints for causing flameout and clogging the tubes in the car engine a few year ago. Biodiesel made from crops isn&#8217;t better. Besides competing with food crops, it costs double the price of regular diesel because it&#8217;s mainly imported.</p>
<p>If the policy is properly made, he believes their diesel should be the &#8220;best pathway to circular economy,&#8221; in which waste is eliminated and resources are continually reused. Countries don&#8217;t have to shy away from export waste anymore because it can all be turned into fuel by EVP&#8217;s technology, including waste that flows from land into the ocean.</p>
<p>Embracing &#8220;blue economy,&#8221; the company is now looking for opportunities to contribute to the world by helping other countries go plastic free.</p>

<h2>Towards the largest meetup platform in East Asia</h2>
<p>Launched in 2016, the app brings strangers together to eat and socialize. Users can either initiate or join a meetup to expand their social circles.</p>
<p>Eatgether&#8217;s meetup ensures bonding experience with new friends without the pressure as in traditional dating, said Wu. On this platform, besides looking for meal pals, users now also arrange gatherings to travel, do sports, go to movies, and play board games together. The app also connect celebrities with fans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the safety of meetup participants is guaranteed through the system that allows users to rate and leave reviews for each other.</p>
<p>COO Kimi Lai said the company has seen a 290% growth in monthly revenue since it allowed users to subscribe to its service. It broke even in the second quarter of the year and started to make profits.</p>
<p>As the number of meetups initiated on the platform increases, by 300% this year in comparison with the figure last year, the app is bringing more and more customers for venue providers, including restaurants. Wu expects the revenue from offline marketing solutions offered to these clients to grow continuously. Earlier in July, the company had rolled out a new service that creates groups of potential customers for restaurant clients.</p>
<p>Now a partner of <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and <a title="https://www.myfunnow.com/en/" href="https://www.myfunnow.com/en/">FunNow</a>, Eatgether said it will announce further plans for overseas markets at the end of this year. It hopes to seek Series A funding soon in an effort to &#8220;become the largest meetup platform in East Asia.&#8221;</p>

<h2>From Taiwan to Japan and Asia</h2>
<p>With one million registered members across the globe, FunNow has set foot on a number of overseas markets, in Tokyo, Okinawa, Kuala Lumpur, and Hong Kong, and partnered with nearly 1,000 vendors. This year, it also expects to see a triple growth in revenue.</p>
<p><strong>What draws the Japanese investor&#8217;s attention is the app&#8217;s algorithms that allow flexible pricing and real-time availability calculations as well as offline travel offerings that have been creating positive user experience in Taiwan for 4 years.</strong></p>
<p>NEC Capital Solutions, the company jointly managing CVF and leading this investment project, is optimistic about replicating FunNow&#8217;s success in major Japanese cities.</p>
<p>Holding the same attitude, Mic Hsieh, the general manger of FunNow Japan, said they are tapping into opportunities brought by the tourist flow into Japan during the Olymic games next year.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier in July, FunNow had just expanded to Tokyo to provide services of three categories: food &amp; drinks, experience &amp; tour, and club &amp; party. The latest funding from the Japanese VC has marked the recognition of its potential, which will help earn trust from local businesses and build a bigger vendor portfolio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has been developing the market of instant booking in Kuala Lumpur. More than 200 massage suppliers, including Healthland Malaysia, the largest chain in this industry, now allow their customers to reserve a therapy online.</p>
<p>FunNow said it will later seek Series B funding with the accomplishments in overseas business development to further accelerate its expansion in Asia and deepen its scale and impact in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Besides turning Taiwan into a R&amp;D hub for the IoT sector, the Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan aims to fuel Taiwan&#8217;s tech startup scene and build a competitive ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>To approach such goal, the government provides financial resources, roll out policies to attract foreign talent, and introduce legislation to support startups.</p>
<p>For early stage startups, it has put in a NT$2B ($64M) angel fund this year through the National Development Fund and co-invested more than NT$2B in 52 projects with private firms. Angel investors are granted tax incentives.</p>
<p>The Fund has also cooperated with world renowned VCs, including Infinity Ventures, to bring in new cash flow and connections that help startups expand into new markets.</p>

(Uniform Lin, COO at STARTBOARD)</p>
<p>Lin Zhifu, the COO at STARTBOARD, shared the practical experience of the ASEAN market especially for those ambitious souls who aspire to set foot in the ASEAN market. His advice are as follows — First thing first, the Southeast Asian market should be considered separately. Many of us may deem ASEAN as a whole market while the culture, environment, religion, and market are diverse to do so. Secondly, without wholehearted preparation, you wouldn’t want to bounge into a new market. Given that the equity agreements often require partners of local nationality to hold up to 49 to 51% of the shares, each enterprise shall think twice. The point is to find a local partner, especially a trustworthy one to cooperate. Last but not least, we need to verify information ruthlessly. Due to its environment and languages, startup information in those countries is not as transparent as Tawian’s. Before any cooperation plan comes into play, due diligence is strongly recommended to manage potential risks.</p>
<p>Ever since its establishment, <a href="https://startboard.co/">STARTBOARD </a>has kept in contact with international talents from ASEAN countries, so as to accumulate the human resources from international talents. In this way, when global talents join in a Taiwan company or startup, they showcase the bonus to connect with ASEAN market and partners and also provide accurate information as well as experiences to live up to the demand of “southbound.”</p>

<p>Rooit is committed to developing mobile applications and dating systems and was selected to play a part in TechStars. Their mission is to find everyone a partner who can confide to. Owing to this totally different core value, Rooit provides anonymous chatroom and interactive game for users to cultivate tacit understanding and communication. Mr. Xu also shared his insights into the Singaporean market based on their experiences. The following are some focal points that determine whether your expanding would go smoothly into ASEAN market.</p>
<p>To begin with, the pivot is market research and estimation. The strategies should either depend on population, geographical location or on the questionnaire. Secondly, when the targeted market has limited resources, then we shall narrow down the range.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Xu mentioned the significance of “speed.” More often then not, startups struggle to maintain daily operation so adaptability to the latest trends and the development with efficiency count. Members of a startup need to adapt their attitudes so as to get along well with different markets and politics as well as culture.</p>

<p>Founded in 2013, <a title="https://www.cj-fund.co.jp/en/" href="https://www.cj-fund.co.jp/en/">Cool Japan Fund</a> is a public-private fund at the center of Japan&#8217;s initiative to promote cultural exports. The sponsors include the local government and well-known Japanese enterprises like Dentsu, ANA Holdings, Bandai Namco Holdings, Fuji Media Holdings, Takashimaya Company, The Keiyo Bank, and so on.</p>
<p>Following the funds from Japanese travel agency H.I.S. and LINE Ventures, KKday CEO Ming Chen said, this investment will boost the company&#8217;s overall growth and its further development in Japan.</p>
<h2>KKday sees a growing demand for activities in Japan</h2>
<p>The recent three years have witnessed a fivefold increase in Taiwanese tourists visiting Japan. Chen also told Business Next that the number of tourists entering Japan for KKday&#8217;s services in the first half of 2019 has outgrown that for the entire 2018.</p>
<p>In light of the large number of repeat travelers, KKday has noticed the need to provide more locally run activities that enable travelers to enjoy authentic Japanese culture, too.</p>
<p>With the support from the Japanese government and investors, the company expects to be given the access to more resources to develop in-depth travel experiences that wouldn&#8217;t be available without this new partnership. The tours can thus include cultural activities that are difficult to book in advance or not offered to foreign tourists at all.</p>
<p>Cooperating with local partners, including big companies, will enable the company to earn the trust in B2B and B2C relationships, which is highly crucial in Japan, Chen said. He proposes to cooperate with a total of 10,000 activity providers in three years.</p>
<p>Cool Japan Fund regards KKday as an important investment partner in inbound tourism for its excellent capabilities in activity planning and execution, CEO Naoki Kitagawa said.</p>
<p>For the upcoming Olympics in Tokyo, it&#8217;s working towards the government&#8217;s goal to attract 40M tourists and add ¥8T (approximately $75B) tourist spending to its annual income.</p>
<p>By financing businesses across four main areas (media &amp; content, food &amp; services, fashion &amp; lifestyle and inbound tourism), the fund aims to expand Japan&#8217;s impact on the global market.</p>
<p>It seems that Japan has opened doors to KKday, but there are still challenges lying ahead, including the possibility to own the exclusive rights to sell the products developed with the help from new partners.</p>

<p>In fact, this royal family member is also the chairman and CEO of the renowned airline Emirates, so the technology will be adopted to reduce the cost of operation and ticket processing, which is regarded as one of the major issues in this industry.</p>
<p>Owlting will also help the local government conduct half of the transactions on a blockchain platform by 2021.</p>
<p>Based in the UAE, the SEED Group has been cooperating with various enterprises around the world to help them enter markets in the East and North Africa nearby. As a part of this partnership, it promised to connect Owlting with the local government and companies for the team to develop the market in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>How blockchain can improve the aviation industry</h2>
<p>In our previous interview with CEO Darren Wang, he said the system should work similarly as <a title="https://www.owlting.com/owlnest/en" href="https://www.owlting.com/owlnest/en">OwlNest</a>, the company&#8217;s hotel management service launched in 2017.</p>

<p>Nowadays, most online hotel booking sites, including Agoda, Booking.com., and Expedia write the data of their orders into a property management system. Causing delay, the gap between the time when the data are submitted and written prevents the platform from synchronizing and can therefore lead to overbooking.</p>
<p>On OwlNest, the data are instead written into a private Ethereum blockchain and managed by Smart Contract. The platform can be linked to external systems to increase efficiency and prevent human error in processing orders.</p>
<p>Wang believes this cooperation is an exceptional opportunity for Owlting to gain presence. On the World Expo 2020 hosted by Dubai, it will show the global community how it applies blockchain in various fields and build a city fully powered by this technology.</p>
<h2>Building a blockchain city in two years</h2>
<p>The UAE government has held a positive attitude towards the application of new technologies. In the previous cabinet reshuffle, the first AI Minister in the world was appointed.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Crown Prince of Dubai H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed inaugurated Smart Dubai, a strategic plan that aims to turn Dubai into a smart city by 2020. A number of public and private services will soon be handled on blockchain platforms, ranging from visa application to real estate transaction.</p>
<p>SEED Group&#8217;s CEO Hisham Al Gurg said the firm is excited to explore new technology with Owlting and looking forward to a fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, OwlTing is operating globally through its branch offices in the USA, Japan, Malaysia, Sweden, and Thailand. For this 10-year-old company, the partnership with the royal family of Dubai is considered a key milestone. Within two years, it&#8217;s expected to go public on NASDAQ and become the first unicorn from Taiwan.</p>

The commute is leashing the efficiency of work and time-consuming. Working at home creates other problems because home is not a professional working environment. Also, working at home has many disadvantages like the distractions, work-life mixups and so forth. Regus spotted the enormous demand of the flexible working space. Regus provides satellite offices for businessmen to work in their co-working space. By building co-working space all over the world, Regus does not only offer alternative office space for its members but also provides geographic-advantage and flexible working space.

He mentioned that the number of South-East Asian talents in Taiwan has increased from thirty thousand to sixty thousand since 2015. Well-educated professionals are seeking for a better connection with the integrated high-tech supply chain in Taiwan. Staying in Taiwan is their first step to open the grand Chinese market. When it comes to “international markets,” many people only think about the U.S.A and Europe; however, Venture Capitals gradually shift their capitals to fast-growing markets like South-East Asia and India. Mr. Lin said, “There are three things VCs looking for in a startup. First, <strong>courage and confidence</strong> are the fuel to overcome the struggles in entrepreneurship and help you through the obstacles with agility. Secondly, <strong>the balance of bold ambition and practical strategy</strong> is important. You have to be keen on the new trend and carefully set forth your plan both financially and strategically. At last, <strong>business reputation and credibility</strong> is the baseline. There is nearly no VC would make an investment on startups which have a dishonest or unethical history.”</p>

Following Collision in Toronto and Techsauce in Thailand, it is the third overseas conference they participate in with their batch in 2019.</p>
<p>This three-day conference begins on July 8 and is expected to attract more than 25,000 attendees from 100+ countries, including 1,000+ startups and 500+ world-class speakers.</p>
<p>The line-up of teams for this event was selected from a pool of 50 earlier in April, during the 8th Rock the Mic pitch competition. They were evaluated based on various criteria, including market potential and demonstrable traction.</p>
<p>According to TSS, the chosen five teams, focused on AI, FinTech, and hardware, “have shown their capabilities and potentials in seeing the needs of rapid development and fulfilling the increasing demand of these booming industries in Hong Kong.”</p>
<h2>Top Five Startups to “Redefine Tech” in Hong Kong with Disruptive Innovations</h2>
<p>Dipp equips their SaaS platform with an AI-powered ads designer, Massimo. With a data-driven approach, it helps customize social media content and banners across all digital marketing channels, enabling designers to concentrate on their creative work.</p>
<p>Blyng’s AI-driven chatbot works as a real estate agent 24/7. With natural language processing, it processes user queries, asking customers key questions and providing them with the best possible answers before the sales team takes over.</p>
<p>AI4quant’s AI-electrocardiography (ECG) platform integrates heart patch sensors with AI diagnosis for early detection of irregular heartbeat patterns.</p>
<p>Baypay provides crypto payment services powered by blockchain, helping users to transfer money and collect payments directly to the bank account in their local currency, without price volatility or risks.</p>
<p>VAGO develops a small, light, and portable vacuum compressor that helps travelers save up to 50% of their luggage space in five minutes.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that three of the five teams were also chosen by e27 to attend Echelon in Singapore, representing Taiwan among the top 100 startup teams from Asia.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, besides attending the conference, TSS and the teams will be visiting local enterprises and organizing interactive workshops with local community partners, including Hong Kong Science &amp; Technology Parks (HKSTP), HKAI LAB, Zerozone, Zeroth.AI, and Explorium. TSS is also holding a community party with their partners, WHub, SOSV, and MOX.</p>

<p>The Taipei-based e-commerce platform announced in mid-April that Taiwanese printed fabric designer <a title="https://www.inblooom.com/en" href="https://www.inblooom.com/en">InBlooom</a> would be the first company to receive investment. Pinkoi executives would not disclose the amount.</p>
<p>Overall, the new joint venture will be investing in more than ten brands within two years, said Peter Yen, the co-founder of Pinkoi, which has 2.7 million online members who buy items such as unique gifts, clothing and furniture on the platform.</p>
<p>“I have seen many talented designers, but they don’t know how to reach global markets,” Yen said, noting that usually only 1% of brands end up retaining a long-term presence overseas.</p>
<p>“Therefore, Pinkoi has formed a team to help designers with issues such as how to take attractive photos of their products or how to communicate with customers,” Yen said.</p>
<p>Cherubic Ventures, which was founded in 2013 and is based in Silicon Valley and Greater China, is focused on early-stage technology. The company has acted as an angel investor for many Taiwanese startups.</p>
<p>“We are happy to do this joint venture together to better the creative industry ecosystem across Asia, said Tina Cheng from Cherubic Ventures at the press conference.</p>
<p>“I am also a big fan of Pinkoi since, as a buyer, I can discover different original design products overseas, such as in Thailand, Malaysia and Japan, on the platform.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, Taiwanese designers’ brands can also be purchased through Pinkoi, allowing them to gain more global visibility. “ Tina Cheng from Cherubic Venture, said.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2011, Pinkoi has expanded to have a presence in 93 countries, selling more than 13,000 foreign-branded goods.</p>
<p>To strengthen its foothold in global markets, Pinkoi in 2016 acquired Japanese designer ecommerce platform <a title="https://www.iichi.com" href="https://www.iichi.com/">iichi</a>, giving the Taiwanese company access to the Japanese companies’ pool of designers.</p>

<p>This is not due to poverty but more because many people do not have “reliable” home addresses and there is no way to deliver purchased products to them.</p>
<p>“Seventy-five percent of places on the earth are badly addressed while at least 4 billion people still don’t have an address,” said van der Heijden.</p>
<p>Van der Heijden is a serial entrepreneur and venture builder. In 1995, van der Heijden established his first software development company, Beyond, He then went on to create pioneering cloud technology in the area of electronic data communications.</p>
<p>His company has come up with a solution to this problem by creating physical addresses for mobile-only internet users without street addresses.</p>

The country’s working age population began to fall after reaching its peak in 2015. The total population is projected to start exhibiting negative growth in 2022, with the working age population falling below 66.7 percent of the total population in 2027, bringing the period of its demographic dividend to an end.</p>
<p>Taiwan urgently needs to respond to these changes in the demographic structure, and to the difficulties caused by pronounced shortages of the technical talent required by domestic industries, by recruiting and supplementing high-grade foreign talent and manpower to augment the human resources needed for national development. As a means to boost industrial upgrading, maintain a reasonable population structure, and raise national competitiveness, this is a vital objective that brooks no delay.</p>
<p>The New Economic Immigration Act (herafter referred to as “this Act”) will relax and broaden the applicable scope of regulations governing qualification to work and stay in Taiwan, access to permanent residence, rights of dependents, and other aspects of the treatment offered to foreign professionals, foreign mid-level technicians, overseas compatriots, and investment immigrants. Also, given that regulation of economic immigration is currently dispersed among various immigration laws and regulations, this new act will serve to enhance administrative efficiency and focus policy implementation by bringing together all pertinent provisions in a single statute, thereby adding greater force to recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>To better attract the foreign professionals needed for the digital economy era and the rapid shift in business models, it is proposed to liberalize the categories of industry and occupation in which their employment is permitted, with adoption of a negative list approach. In addition, a points system will be utilized for screening the work qualifications of foreign professionals, to establish more diverse employment conditions, and capital and turnover requirements will be relaxed for employers in key industries, to help businesses recruit the kinds of high-caliber international talent they need.</p>
<p>To solve the shortage of mid-level technical manpower needed by domestic industries, reference was made to international practices in mapping out proposals for the employment of foreign students and basic-level foreign personnel who possess mid-level technical work skills, or for directly importing foreign nationals with mid-level technical work skills. Such kinds of technical manpower will all have to meet requirements of salary level and work qualifications. There will also be a total number cap and individual industry quotas. With regard to the direct import of mid-level technical manpower from abroad, the schedule and scope of this will be separately announced by the Executive Yuan, depending on the situation of employment of the other two aforesaid types of technical manpower and the development needs of domestic industries.</p>
<p>In addition, considering the large number of our compatriots residing overseas, and that there are many among them with prime skills and expertise, who ought to be actively targeted for recruitment, this bill proposes relaxing the current entry permit,registered permanent residence and other rules applicable to overseas compatriots who possess ROC nationality under the provisions of the Nationality Act.</p>
<p>On the basis that investment immigrants come within the scope of economic immigration, and is also an object of active promotion by the government, but considering that Taiwan’s current avenues and conditions for investment immigrants are already quite diverse and relaxed compared to neighboring countries, current regulations relating to investment residency, permanent residency and registered permanent residence are integrated in this bill to achieve the purpose of policy declaration.</p>
<p>The bill proposes relaxing conditions pertaining to permanent residency, dependents, and so on for foreign professionals, as well as stipulating conditions for permanent residency of mid-level technicians, and conditions for residency and permanent residency of their dependents. For foreign nationals who obtain permanent residency, it proposes providing ancillary measures of Employment Insurance and new labor pension system coverage and relevant social security and living assistance, to establish a friendlier immigration environment.</p>

<p>The purpose of the incubator is to foster global connections between Taiwanese entrepreneurs and the rest of the world, Chen told a conference that included Benoit Guidee, the director of the French Office in Taipei and Christian Fuchssteiner, the director of Austrian Commercial Office.</p>
<p>“We hope to see more and more global startups choose Taiwan as a place to settle down and do business,” Chen said.</p>
<p>“Taiwan’s semiconductors are at a cutting-edge level… which is a huge support to our technology.”</p>
<p>The French and Austrian directors said they were open to cooperation. In particular French Tech Taiwan, a French government-backed hub that helps French startups extend their global reach, has an office inside Taiwan Tech Arena.</p>
<p>The French Tech Taiwan office is a space &#8220;for both sides’ entrepreneurs to have a place to share resources together,” said Laurent Le Guyader, the coordinator of French Tech Taiwan.</p>
<h2>From remote speech pathology using AI-powered applications to mobile apps</h2>
<p>The representatives from the four accelerators all took turns on the stage to give brief introductions at the conference. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>Taiwan’s medical and health industries are at an exceptional standard, said Arthur Chen, the managing director of <a title="http://www.beaccelerator.com.tw/3931838913.html" href="http://www.beaccelerator.com.tw/3931838913.html">BE Accelerator</a>.</p>
<p>“Biotech is the core field we focus on,” Chen said.</p>
<p>In addition, the accelerator also targets three other fields: digital healthcare, AI-powered medical technology and smart healthcare.</p>
<p>Chen said he pictured his accelerator as a gateway to other Asian markets.</p>
<p>It is already cultivating six startups including <a title="https://www.mypenguinsmart.com" href="https://www.mypenguinsmart.com/">PenguinSmart</a>, which helps children with remote speech and language rehabilitation using AI-powered applications, and <a title="http://www.winnoz.com" href="http://www.winnoz.com/">Winnoz</a>, which has developed healthcare devices using the internet of things and AI.</p>
<p>Also stationed in the Taiwan Tech Arena is <a title="https://mobileonlyx.com" href="https://mobileonlyx.com/">Mobile Only Accelerator (MOX)</a>, which is sponsored by venture capital and investment management firm SOSV. With a focus on mobile apps, it provides seed and growth stage funding for technology startups to the tune of US$400 million. MOX has seven accelerators worldwide. Besides Taipei, they are stationed in London, China and New York.</p>
<p>Sparklabs Taipei officially launched in 2018. The accelerator is a branch of Silicon Valley-based <a title="http://www.sparklabsgroup.com" href="http://www.sparklabsgroup.com/">Spark Labs Group.</a></p>
<p>Edgar Chiu, Sparklabs Taipei’s managing partner, said his accelerator was looking to invest in various fields, including blockchain technologies, the internet of things, AI, machine learning, healthcare and other sectors.</p>
<p>Chui encouraged entrepreneurs to harbor big ambitions and to plan to “go global” when they were ready to set up their businesses.</p>
<p>National Chiao Tung University launched <a title="http://iaps.nctu.edu.tw/index_en.html" href="http://iaps.nctu.edu.tw/index_en.html">IAPS</a>, the first accelerator on a Taiwanese campus in 2013. Its main advantage is its pool of young talents.</p>
<p>IAPS is devoted to supporting early-stage, growth-driven companies through mentorship matchmaking activities and international collaboration. IAPS partners with some leading companies, including Foxconn and Advantech.</p>

<p>Of the report’s 10 assessment categories, Taiwan fared best in dealing with construction permits at 87.11 for second globally. It also performed well in getting electricity, 96.32 for eighth; and protecting minority investors, 75 for 15th.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s strong construction permit showing was attributed by the World Bank to improving the efficiency of the single window counter operated by Taipei City Government’s Construction Management Office, as well as strengthening minority investor protection via enhancing ownership and control structures in listed companies.</p>
<p>In response, the Cabinet-level National Development Council said the government is enhancing Taiwan’s business environment through such measures as easing regulations on company registration and recognition, and streamlining application procedures.</p>
<p>Regarding the categories in which Taiwan dropped back—getting credit and trading across borders—the NDC said it will continue working closely with the Financial Supervisory Commission and Ministry of Finance in fast-tracking reforms related to movable property transactions, as well as import and export customs clearances.</p>
<p>First released in 2003, the annual report is widely considered a reliable measure of how regulations affect small and medium enterprises based on standardized case scenarios in the largest business city of each economy.</p>

<p>The team from Taiwan’s Asian Silicon Valley Development Agency, which was launched by the government in 2016 to connect Taiwan with global tech clusters, arranged for the 15 Taiwanese youth to attend Draper’s “Hero Training Program” in San Mateo, California.</p>
<p>“Based on the entrepreneurs&#8217; positive experiences and positive feedback, the ministry had decided to proceed with further cooperation,” said Kung Ming-hsin, Vice Minister at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which backs the Asian Silicon Valley project.</p>
<p>Draper University is focused on teaching entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, the cradle of high technology in America. It was founded in 2012</p>
<p>It has dispensed with traditional styles of lecturing, and instead offers five-to-seven-week programs involving online courses for learning about Bitcoin and other kinds of latest technological trends. Besides the programs, the university also has a shared workspace called Hero City.</p>
<p>According to the school, Draper University has over 500 alumni from 50 countries and has launched over 280 startups that have raised US$51 million in investment funding.</p>
<p>The Asian Silicon Valley Development Agency team visited Draper University in May this year to understand more about the university’s system.</p>
<p>The team decided to have its first cooperative venture with the university in early August, with ten young Taiwanese entrepreneurs attending its intensive training sessions. The second batch of 15 went later in the month.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Kung Ming-hsin said in a statement that cooperation with the university was set to continue.</p>
<h5>Talent is an asset to develop and cherish</h5>
<p>Deputy Minister Kung says Taiwan’s talents are an economic asset. Therefore one of the main missions of the Asian Silicon Valley Development Agency project is connecting talents to resources.</p>
<p>Some of the 15 selected candidates were not entrepreneurs. They were inexperienced people with a desire to learn more about entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>For example, there was an undergraduate student from National Taiwan University(Taiwan’s top university, located in the capital Taipei), who was selected to take part in the program.</p>
<p>David Su, another selected entrepreneur, is the founder of Rockids.Co.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Asian Silicon Valley Development Agency, Su has a rich educational background.</p>
<p>Therefore he wants to combine the latest technologies relating to education, such as combining 3D printing and virtual reality, to create courses for students in the near future.</p>
<p>Su is joining this program with hopes of learning more from Draper University and then sharing his own experiences with the next generation.</p>

<p>It has also bought several factories in Taiwan within one year, including OEM company Inventec Corporation’s factory Daxi and networking manufacturer Arris’s factory in Xindian. Therefore, its Taiwan locations could also provide production support.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s short-term revenue would definitely be affected owing to factory adjustments. However, we plan to establish global infrastructure scattering production across the world in response to trading conflicts in the future, said Lian.</p>
<p>Besides these two companies, other Taiwanese big OEM names that will also be affected by the latest round of tariffs, include Foxconn for its smart speaker Echo, Quanta for helping to produce Apple Watch and speaker Google Home Mini, and Inventec for manufacturing Sonos and Fitbit.</p>

Sustainable Development Goals were highlighted in a speech by Minister without Portfolio Audrey Tang Sept. 21 at New York-based Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>
<p>According to Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister, efforts to establish an open and multistakeholder governance system align with SDG targets 17.6, 17.17 and 17.18, which encompass such objectives as boosting international cooperation on and access to technology and promoting effective public, public-private and civic society partnerships.</p>
<p>Open government, social innovation and youth engagement can ensure citizens have a meaningful input in policymaking, Tang said. The minister pointed to several Taiwan developments in this regard, including the establishment of the participation officer network, public officials in each ministry designated to engage with civil society on emerging issues; and the Social Innovation Lab, a facility for fostering new social enterprises and hosting public meetings on related government initiatives.</p>
<p>Growing citizen-government collaboration, Tang said, is delivering tangible benefits. She highlighted successful efforts to improve the online tax filing system through the participation officer network, as well as the launch of an air quality website displaying real-time atmospheric data collected by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration and from over 2,000 measurement devices operated by members of the public.</p>
<p>Following the speech, the minister took part in a Q&amp;A session hosted by Daniel Russel, ASPI vice president and former U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Among the topics discussed were promoting technological innovation in rural communities, and how Taiwan’s strategies for collaborative governance can be implemented in developing countries through low-cost hardware solutions.</p>
<p>The event was among a series of addresses by Tang in New York. She spoke the previous day at the Technology and Social Innovation for Sustainable Development forum at Columbia University, and at a Sept. 22 panel on digital governance staged by a Taiwanese-American community organization based in the city.</p>
<p>Tang’s participation in the New York events was arranged as part of a campaign by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs themed U.N. Global Goals—Taiwan Can Help. Staged on the sidelines of the 73rd U.N. General Assembly, the initiative urges the multilateral body to deliver equal treatment to Taiwan’s 23 million people and resolve the issue of the nation’s exclusion from the U.N. system; grant press accreditation to Taiwan journalists and allow unfettered access to U.N. premises for the country’s passport holders; and include Taiwan in SDG-related meetings, mechanisms and activities.</p>

<p>The company plans to increase production in factories located in Mexico, Czech Republic and India if it is forced to decrease production in China.</p>
<p>It has also bought several factories in Taiwan within one year, including OEM company Inventec Corporation’s factory Daxi and networking manufacturer Arris’s factory in Xindian. Therefore, its Taiwan locations could also provide production support.</p>
<p>“We have established plans for short-term and long-term,” said Lian Sih-Jheng, the CEO of Pegatron Corporation.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s short-term revenue would definitely be affected owing to factory adjustments. However, we plan to establish global infrastructure scattering production across the world in response to trading conflicts in the future, said Lian.</p>
<p>Besides these two companies, other Taiwanese big OEM names that will also be affected by the latest round of tariffs, include Foxconn for its smart speaker Echo, Quanta for helping to produce Apple Watch and speaker Google Home Mini, and Inventec for manufacturing Sonos and Fitbit.</p>
<p>The September hearing result will determine Taiwanese OEM&#8217;s’ sales performance for the last quarter of 2018.</p>

<p>But developing offshore wind power has its cost, roughly double that of onshore production. It costs more because energy must be moved from turbines at sea – and periodically repaired.</p>
<p>It also comes with technical challenges such building as corrosion-resistant towers, offshore moorings and kilometers worth of cables to connect turbines to the power grid. Taiwan aims to generate 5.5 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2025.</p>
<p>But according to a Siemens <a title="https://www.energy.siemens.com/br/pool/hq/power-generation/renewables/wind-power/SCOE/Infoblatt-what-is-the-real-cost-of-offshore.pdf" href="https://www.energy.siemens.com/br/pool/hq/power-generation/renewables/wind-power/SCOE/Infoblatt-what-is-the-real-cost-of-offshore.pdf">report</a>, some countries will generate up to 100.5 gigawatts, making Taiwan a minor player in the global market. Projects also face high costs for repairs and transportation of supplies.</p>
<p>To help Taiwan develop wind power offshore, which also eliminates complaints about noise and blight that might hobble onshore projects, the Spanish firm Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy hosted a one-day forum for supply chain partners, signaling a commitment to the local market.</p>
<p>Its officials described ways to overcome some of the barriers, including growth of a local supply chain.</p>
<p>Siemens Gamesa is the second largest global wind turbine manufacturer in the world with a strong presence in India and a growing position in the United States, according to a report. In fiscal year 2017 the Spanish company generated revenue of US$7.5 million. In Taiwan, the company already sold two turbines for an offshore wind project led by Swancor Corp. near Miaoli county.</p>
<p>Siemens Gamesa operates about 2,300 offshore wind turbines worldwide, according to a company press release.</p>
<p>The Swancor project called Formosa Phase I started commercial operation in April 2017. The Spanish firm will sell 20 turbines next year 2019 for phase two, according to a company press release.</p>
<h2>Local supply chain</h2>
<p>This increased demand for the firm’s turbines has prompted Siemens Gamesa to solidify its local supply chain. Typically, a wind turbine has some 8,000 parts and can stand as tall as the Statue of Liberty, according to a website operated by the US Department of Energy.</p>
<p>The size of many parts, such as blades, motors, and tower components, makes local sourcing essential due to otherwise high transportation costs. Quality matters, too, because repair work can be tough, so many manufacturers ask for parts certification and check to make sure the equipment is sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;The quality of the components is very important,&#8221; said Niels Steenberg, general manager of offshore wind power for then Asia Pacific, at the Siemens Gamesa localization event. Repair work, he said, requires renting a boat at US$300,000 a day for a week.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s lack of a deep-water harbor for offshore wind turbine installation adds a setback. Siemens Gamesa signed a memorandum of understanding with the state-owned shipping company, Taiwan International Ports Corp., in late 2017 to overcome that issue.</p>
<p>Siemens Gamesa’s work in Taiwan will benefit a small local supply chain today with 6 local suppliers and 4 international firms who recently signed MOUs with the company. But those numbers could soon expand, Steenberg said.</p>
<p>Many other turbine makes are eager to enter Taiwan, as it plans to develop offshore wind power in 12 places, mostly on the west coast, according to a European Chamber of Commerce Taiwan report “Energy for the Next Generation.”</p>
<p>Asia’s offshore wind power market is getting bigger every year, Steenberg told the event as cited by <a title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/50174/siemens-gamesa-offshore-in-taiwan" href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/50174/siemens-gamesa-offshore-in-taiwan">Business Next.</a> The market in Asia is lags Europe by about 10 years, he added.</p>

<p>The company announced US$410 million (NT$12.3 billion) in net profits for the second quarter of this year, the lowest figure posted since a company restructure one year ago aimed at combating nine years of sluggish growth.</p>
<p>In mid-2017, it restructured a business division, known as its systems business group, which develops devices running on operational systems, including computers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>The group was divided into three individual units to separately manage the company’s personal computer business, mobile computing devices and gaming computers business. Asus executives hoped the change would sharpen the company’s focus on each of these businesses and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>The latest financial results show the restructure has not harvested any results. They also indicated three challenges Asus needs to overcome.</p>
<h2>Delayed supply chain</h2>
<p>Development of Asus’s last two flagship smartphones was delayed when a supply chain was switched from Taiwan to China, causing them to be released in the second half of the year, facing competition from new iPhones from Apple and Samsung’s Galaxy Note series.</p>
<p>Later on, its latest flagship smartphone and related series, the ZenFone 5, 5Z and Max Pro, were launched at a good sales time in April this year. They performed well in India, Indonesia and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The company relocated final assembly in its supply chain to China in order to lower manufacturing costs and thus the price of its smartphones to compete against lower-cost brands, including China’s Xiaomi. But the Chinese company could not produce devices fast enough and Asus could not respond to consumers&#8217; orders worldwide.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Asus has hired Jerry Tsao, a former Intel sales and marketing regional head, as chief operating officer this January. The new executive plans to set up a 200-strong team to improve supply chains in China and hopes to solve this issue by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<h2>Unstable executive team</h2>
<p>The management at Asus is going through a rocky patch as the company struggles with succession issues. Asus Chairman Jonney Shih, 66, has postponed a planned resignation for a year.</p>
<p>Asus for years had only been focused on traditional hardware design and development. Now that AI is seen as the main future technology in the industry, ASUS is under pressure to integrate AI into its products and services to keep up to date.</p>
<p>New technologies require fresh talent. Shin has recently brought several relatively young employees into his executive team and gradually established a new decentralized corporate structure, but it is still too early to see if this will bring results.</p>
<p>In other restructures, Asus added a new business unit known as “business computer” into its systems business group this April, in the hope to sharpen its business focus.</p>
<p>The company meanwhile is still looking for a chief marketing officer to handle its global communications.</p>
<p>Shih also promised the restructure was for responding to market changes and there would be no lay-offs.</p>
<h2>Networking device subsidiary experiences continuous losses</h2>
<p>One of the biggest drags on profits was Askey, an Asus subsidiary selling electronic and network communications products. Its financial losses reached US$20.4 million (NT$612 million) this quarter.</p>
<p>Founded in 1989, Askey has manufacturing sites in Taipei, Taiwan, and Suzhou, China as well as big clients like Verizon. It was once a profit-making venture in 2016, before seeing losses for six consecutive quarters totaling US$72 million(NT$2.16 billion)</p>
<p>Shih said operation adjustments at Askey were taking longer than expected, without giving details, and he promised a better financial performance by the fourth quarter this year at the earnings call.</p>
<p>Investors are waiting Asus to deliver better financial results in the second half of this year. The trade war between the U.S. and China, however, have caused currency depreciation around the world, which will impact on Asus’s total profits from its global retail channels.</p>

<p>At the launch of the Industrial Innovation and Transformation Fund Project Office at the end of July, NDC Minister Chen Mei-ling said the fund was for helping small and medium-sized enterprises in the country boost competitiveness and productivity in the global markets.</p>
<p>“Taiwan’s over 1.4 million small and medium-sized enterprises &#8212; SMEs &#8212; are the backbone of our economic development,” Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen expressed hope that the new office would manage the fund, created over a year ago, more effectively.</p>
<p>The new office will be headed by Chou Shya-li, the director-general of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a private economic think tank, and overall will be managed by the institute.</p>
<p>“The NT$100-billion Industrial Innovation and Transformation Fund has been promoted for over a year. So far, we have not allocated this fund as effectively as we wanted to. Perhaps it’s because of a lack of effective marketing strategies,” Chen said.</p>
<p>She added that only four projects had benefited from the fund since it was created. Now that the office is established, she said, she hoped the fund would be depleted in a year’s time.</p>
<p>The fund is for investments in companies that are looking at mergers and acquisitions, spin-offs and transformation of their business models. The goal is to encourage Taiwanese companies upgrade and adopt new technologies at a faster pace.</p>
<p>“The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research is going to build up a team of experts, advisors and mentors from different industries who will provide consulting and mentorship to (successful) applicants of the Industrial Innovation and Transformation Fund,”Chou said.</p>
<p>She showed a picture of the team members who will help run the office.Chou said that one of the priority tasks for the team is to actively look for potential applicants.</p>
<p>“We have invited many industry leaders, experts, lawyers, accountants and mentors from the ecosystem in the past few months to offer consulting services when (reviewing applications for) the NDC fund,”Chou said.</p>
<p>She noted that the team will not only search for potential applicants and help them go through application and review process, but also follow up on their progress and assess their performance. This will make sure that the fund is effectively used throughout the entire process, she said.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s decision to set up an AI R&amp;D center and partnership with local Taiwanese universities follows its long relationship Taiwanese PC hardware manufacturers and reflects the strength of local universities. Relatively low labor costs make Taiwan extra attractive, and – unlike China – Taiwan is not involved in trade disputes with the United States.</p>
<h2>Talent and competitiveness</h2>
<p>Microsoft Public Sector Lead Patrick Pan told the Liberty Times that helping schools develop AI programs will breed talent followed by employment advantages for graduates. Aid to schools will further accelerate Taiwan&#8217;s global competitiveness in the AI industry, and lay a solid foundation for AI, Pan added.</p>
<p>For now the American software giant will work with students at Taiwan-based Asia University to help develop AI applications and with those at Chiao Tung University on Microsoft AI certification courses.</p>
<p>Microsoft certification courses teach skills with hands-on instruction. They are designed to be consistent with modern industry technology. Students also get credentials that employers want.</p>
<p>Helping schools build what it calls “AI+ Experience Centers” and developing practice drills for scenarios in various industries will enhance Taiwan&#8217;s AI talent, Microsoft said as cited in the Liberty Times report. Today some anticipate a talent shortage.</p>
<p>Microsoft is negotiating cooperation agreements with other schools in Taiwan, as well. The terms and scope of each agreement will be tailored to the school itself.</p>
<h2>Chung Hua University case study</h2>
<p>Chung Hua University, the latest institution to join Microsoft’s AI effort, will be equipped with an AI+ Experience Center. The facility will come with more than 30 Microsoft Surfaces, which are touchscreen Windows personal computers, and a 75-inch touchscreen panel, according to a <a title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/49681/microsoft-ai-center-college" href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/49681/microsoft-ai-center-college">Business Next report</a>June 27.</p>
<p>The university said the center is expected to open at the start of the 2018 academic year. No cost of the AI+ Experience Center has been reported.</p>
<p>The AI+ Experience Center will grant entry based on facial recognition and use a robot by Asustek Computer to simulate AI-enabled transactions at restaurants and shops. Students will design the interactive processes using Microsoft’s own tools.</p>
<p>Students will learn first not to fear AI, Taiwan Microsoft General Manager Ken Sun said in this <a title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/49681/microsoft-ai-center-college" href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/49681/microsoft-ai-center-college">Business Next article.</a></p>
<p>University Vice President Yu Kun-Ming said many of his students are afraid of AI but that the design of the AI+ Experience Center will draw them into it and help add this subject to university curriculum.</p>
<p>Microsoft has pledged as well to help university professors design new courses that incorporate AI. Fifteen teachers are expected to participate in the program and in late 2018 all five colleges under the university will offer at least one AI course, Business Next said.</p>
<p>The College of Computer Science and Informatics, for example, will open a class on AI in manufacturing. Students would learn to simulate operation of factory manufacturing equipment and do maintenance.</p>
<p>College of Architecture and Design students will be able to develop AI-based applications for connected devices in homes, while College of Tourism students can create applications for hotels and travel agencies.</p>

Some people are afraid of it. But AI can already extract topics from documents, just to name one example, and every big name in high tech is trying to develop it.</p>
<p>Animashree Anandkumar, principal scientist at the Amazon.com subsidiary Amazon Web Services and a California Institute of Technology professor, spoke at the <a title="https://www.diftaipei2018.org" href="https://www.diftaipei2018.org/">2018 Digital Innovation Forum</a> in Taipei July 20. Business Next did a Q&amp;A with Anandkumar at the event about what AI means, what’s next for the technology and what she is doing with it.</p>
<h2>Q: How should people think about artificial intelligence?</h2>
<p>When we talk about artificial intelligence, we need to think, first of all, what is intelligence? I think there is a lot of confusion about what is artificial intelligence and what is not artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>(I gave) an example of a Boston Dynamics Atlas robot, which is a very sophisticated robot that can do backflips. Then I contrasted it with a dog that actually fumbled a ball. The message is the dog is intelligent but the Atlas robot is not, because the robot is being programmed. The point is: The ability to acquire knowledge and build on skills, and learn more from the surrounding world, is intelligence.</p>
<p>Once we have that clarification of what intelligence is, we can then ask ourselves what does artificial intelligence involve? I talked about how the trinity— data, algorithms, infrastructure — is fuelling artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Usually when people think of AI, they only think of the algorithm. But without data, without the internet, we wouldn’t have had our deep learning systems. Without GPUs, we would not have had deep learning. All these three have to come together.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where do we go next? What is the future?</strong></p>
<p>At Caltech, we have recently launched a program called CAST, the new Caltech Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies. It’s a new initiative from Caltech launched in October last year.</p>
<p>The Centre for Autonomous Systems and Technology is looking at the future of artificial intelligence—the idea of bringing mind and body together.</p>
<p>Machine bodies like robots we have right now is mostly the body without the mind. The question is how do we bring artificial intelligence and robotics together? I think that’s going to be the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are some of the projects you’ve been working on?</strong></p>
<p>At Amazon Web Services, I’m involved with several projects, including Amazon Rekognition and Amazon SageMaker. I’ve built many core algorithms including work for topic modelling.</p>
<p>What this algorithm does is you can use a bunch of documents and extract the topics automatically. This work was based on my research, which I have published before. It was good to see that one of the research projects done five years ago can now be turned into a reality.</p>
<p>My company Amazon Web Services has a partnership with Caltech and has funded over US$200 million to Caltech faculty and students.</p>
<p>I’m proud to say that Amazon Web Services has funded over 40 proposals across the Caltech campus. There’s just so many fascinating usages and applications of machine learning. I look forward to seeing more of interesting research coming out from the community.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Microsoft set up an artificial intelligence (AI) research and development center in Taiwan in January. In March, Google announced it will hire 300 people in Taiwan and train 5,000 Taiwanese students in artificial intelligence programming. I’m curious, what is Amazon doing in Taiwan?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we don’t comment on our competitors, and I personally cannot comment on Amazon’s engagement with Taiwan. I know that there has been an innovation center being set up early this year in Taipei. Amazon is a big company. But I would say that Amazon is interested in enabling AI across the globe.</p>
<p>I would like to see more grassroots-driven open source projects emerging from the AI community.</p>
<p>I think we need to make it very easy for anyone—high school students, college students, engineers and scientists—to get started with machine learning. And of course, if Taiwanese governments are making growing the AI talent pool a priority, I think it’s a move in the right direction.</p>

A lawmaker says it would save overseas investors money and hassle on making currency conversions.</p>
<p>But their ideas are not the only ones. A proposal in Taiwan for an official coin faces opposition from people who believe crypto should stay decentralized.</p>
<p>Linking cryptocurrency to official units such as the new Taiwan dollar can make them more easily convertible, ideal for trade rather than just speculation, Lee told Business Next. Sweden, Israel and Russia, and others, have backed national digital currencies.</p>
<p>Tether’s USDT, a cryptocurrency coin linked one-to-one to the U.S. dollar, he notes, can do this function.</p>
<p>Skeptics of a government-backed coin believe it would violate the decentralization principle of digital currencies.</p>
<h2>Legislator’s support</h2>
<p>Taiwan opposition party legislator Jason Hsu also advocates issuing a “Taiwan Dollar Digital Coin” primarily for financing cross-border trade.</p>
<p>Taiwan&#8217;s manufacturing industry spends a lot on U.S. dollar-to-Taiwan dollar conversions, which the digital coin could do, Hsu says in the same Business Next article. The digital coin could do this transaction, he said, and blockchain could potentially replace the letter of credit.</p>
<p>Taiwanese investors with overseas income should try for a way to avoid exchange rate volatility, he said.</p>
<h2>A role for blockchain</h2>
<p>But the establishment of an official currency requires agreement on technical matters such as building a blockchain or distributing the coin on an existing blockchain.</p>
<p>The public blockchain should offer enough security if provided with enough people to mine the currency, said Lee, whose started the world’s sixth biggest crypto unit. He says it’s not cost-effective to pay for mining a Taiwan currency due to the risks.</p>
<p>A government-supported blockchain in Taiwan could expand the sector as a whole and let crypto traders capitalize upon advantages over neighboring China, Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee worked before as an engineer for the San Francisco-based digital currency trading platform Coinbase. He remembers how Coinbase had trouble opening a local currency bank account in Taiwan and rejections by local banks.</p>
<p>Unclear regulations coupled with the “conservative attitude” by local banks made it difficult for Coinbase to establish operations, Lee said.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology company Chelpis, financial technology company Addweup and AI-powered healthcare company Aether AI made it to the final selection round.</p>
<p>This was announced at a networking event in Taipei, one of an international series organized by Startupbootcamp as its executives searched for the best early-stage companies for cultivating in the accelerator across the world.</p>
<p>The three selected Taiwanese companies will now compete with startups selected from other nations for a place in a three-month intensive accelerator program in Amsterdam that runs from the beginning of November to mid-February next year.</p>
<p>“Startupbootcamp has the ability to gather international innovation and resources for Taiwanese startup companies,” said Michael Dooijes, the program’s managing director, who introduced Startupbootcamp’s various accelerators to a group of Taiwanese entrepreneurs at the event.</p>
<p>Dooijes explained that the organizers of this year’s program in Amsterdam are looking for companies specialized in a number of areas that include blockchain, financial payment services, capital markets and asset management, along with mobile financial technology, cloud and data privacy and virtual reality.</p>
<p>The networking event known as &#8220;FastTrack&#8221; included two sessions. In the first session, hopeful Taiwanese startups gave presentations. In the second, startup founders held one-on-one meetings with potential mentors and corporate backers provided by Startupbootcamp.</p>
<p>Overall, ten Taiwanese startups invited to participate in the event by Startupbootcamp received advice and feedback in areas relating to product design, and business model design, along with suggestions for sales and marketing strategies from several Startupbootcamp corporate partners and mentors who came on the trip to Taiwan with Dooijes.</p>
<p>Chih Ming-yang of Chelpis said his company, founded last year, is currently building a blockchain-based decentralized exchange with a user-friendly interface that will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins with no third party involved.</p>
<p>Unlike China, which has banned cryptocurrency exchanges, Taiwan’s stance is unclear. Companies such as Chelpis are preparing blockchain technology-based products and services in case Taiwan ever approves them.</p>
<p>Startupbootcamp Taiwan, the main organizer of Fast Track in Taipei, said Taiwan is a hub of innovation and the country’s geographic proximity to other countries in the Asia Pacific region is an advantage.</p>
<p>The organization said it hopes to build a thriving startup ecosystem in Taiwan.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to building and maintaining strong relationships with Asia through Taiwan,”Startupbootcamp Taiwan said.</p>

<p>Taiwan Premier William Lai announced in mid-May his cabinet’s New Economic Migrant Act aimed at attracting foreign workers. It should help Taiwan meet demand for talent, he told a news conference. Parliament will review the act, with an eye toward passage, in its session that begins in September.</p>
<p>The Taiwan population is expected to decline from about 23 million to fewer than 20 million by 2035, Lai said, and the government needs a bill to help backfill a dearth of skilled workers left by that fall. Their arrivals in Taiwan would help spur economic growth, he said.</p>
<p>About 120,000 additional mid-level workers would ideally reach Taiwan, National Development Council Minister Chen Mei-ling said. Mid-level skilled workers cover technical assistants, drivers, machine operators and skilled assembly line workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taiwan has long opened its job market to professional talent as well as migrant workers in the manufacturing, construction, social welfare and home care sectors, but not to mid-level skilled workers,&#8221; Chen told the news conference.</p>
<p>Births in the first quarter of 2018 dropped several thousand from the same period of last year, Chen said. Taiwan&#8217;s population growth rate will begin to turn negative in 2025 if the trend continues, she said.</p>
<h2>Draft immigration bill</h2>
<p>Lai’s proposed bill includes measures to let more foreign investors as well as technical personnel and other professionals work in Taiwan. As of May, over 680,000 foreign workers were in Taiwan, according to government statistics.</p>
<p>According to a report by Taipei-based Central News Agency, officials say the bill also would let migrant skilled workers apply for permanent residency, naturalization, and visas for family members.</p>
<p>The bill spells out looser requirements for permanent residency, as well. Foreign talents who wish to apply for permanent residency are now required to stay in Taiwan for five consecutive years. The proposed bill shortens that period to three years for certain professionals.</p>
<p>The rules cover all nationalities except workers from mainland China. They do apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau. Mainland Chinese must follow the Regulations Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the People of the Mainland China Area, Chen said.</p>
<p>Under the current rules, foreigners can apply for permanent residency in Taiwan only if they work here for at least seven years and stay at least 183 days a year.</p>
<p>To apply for permanent residence in Taiwan under the draft bill, a worker in the social care sector must make at least NT$32,000 (US$1,070) per month, and an industrial sector worker must earn a monthly minimum of NT$41,393.</p>

But on August 10 the government agency reversed that decision and indicated it would settle with Qualcomm, leading to cooperation agreements with the company and new conditions for its business in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Qualcomm said it would spend US$700 million to promote Taiwanese industry, for the benefit of business and consumers, over the next five years. Some of that funding will help industry launch 5G networks and expand into new markets. Qualcomm will build a new operations center and production facility in Taiwan, too.</p>
<p>Government incubator the Industrial Technology Reseach Institute and Qualcomm will work together on the 5G networks.</p>
<p>The commission fined Qualcomm last year and asked it to change intellectual property contracts with competitors in the industry. Its chief Taiwanese competitor is MediaTek. Qualcomm did not accept the verdict and sought to settle, in the process suspending the 5G project.</p>
<p>Qualcomm will not challenge the NT$3.7 billion (US$121 million) in fines it has already paid.</p>
<h2>Early days of cooperation</h2>
<p>Taiwan Minister of Science and Technology Cheng Liang-gee said last year it was unclear whether cooperation Qualcomm on 5G was completely beneficial.</p>
<p>Many of Taiwan’s 5G products and services had not hit the market when expected, but ties with Qualcomm should give Taiwanese manufacturers such as MediaTek the chance to keep up with new industry trends in 5G, Cheng said.</p>
<p>Because, Cheng said, “the company has reached the agreement in good faith, we are certain that cooperation between Qualcomm and Taiwanese partners will resume just as before.”</p>
<h2>Settlement terms</h2>
<p>Also as part of the settlement, the San Diego, California-based firm known especially for its Snapdragon line of mobile phone processors agreed to certain patent licensing terms in Taiwan.</p>
<p>It’s barred from threatening to stop supplies of chips in violation of any contracts it has with Taiwanese buyers. Qualcomm’s Standard Essential Patents (SEP) licensing program may not discriminate against any signatory, regardless of its scale.</p>
<p>Qualcomm will provide contractual agreements upon request from Taiwanese chip suppliers.</p>
<p>Taiwan is one in a string of governments that have fined Qualcomm for its alleged monopolistic licensing scheme, with China fining the company in 2015 and South Korea doing the same in 2016. Tech heavyweights such as Apple and Foxconn have filed their own lawsuits against the company, accusing it of using the scheme to charge contractors twice for its chips.</p>
<p>Qualcomm has agreed to submit a report to the Taiwan government twice a year through 2023, and if it signs a contract with any Taiwanese chip supplier or mobile phone manufacturer, the company must report that to the Fair Trade Commission within 30 days.</p>
<p>If Qualcomm does not honor its commitments, the commission will use arbitration to settle disputes.</p>

<p>Over 400 experts, scholars and industry leaders are expected to attend the four-day event, which will focus on areas such as smart cities, smart healthcare solutions, blockchain and future startup ecosystems, officials from Taiwan’s Small and Medium Enterprise Administration said.</p>
<p>Jonathan Ortmans, president of the Global Entrepreneurship Network, which is helping to run the event, said his organization operates in 170 countries to “support, connect, understand and celebrate entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p>“We will not only be examining the future on where we will have an impact on our society through IoT, AI and some of the new technologies that are making possible for entrepreneurs to start and scale new firms but also to help society and the individual around them,” Ortmans said in a pre-recorded video clip displayed at the beginning of the press event.</p>
<p>Raymond Greene, deputy director of Taiwan’s de facto American embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan, said both Taiwan and the U.S. had been involved in the Global Entrepreneurship Network for several years.</p>
<p>“Taiwan is emerging as a global hub and launching pad for innovative startups. In the past, Taiwan was often seen as the gateway into China, but now Taiwan is increasingly seen as the gateway into South and Southeast Asia.” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What most distinguishes Taiwan is it does not pursue innovation simply for purposes of making money – although that is certainly a good thing to do too – rather, it always puts positive social benefit first and foremost.</p>
<p>“In this respect, Taiwan acts as a role model for the whole world,&#8221; Greene said.</p>
<p>Minister without Portfolio Audrey Tang, also known as Taiwan’s Digital Minister, said Taiwan’s Cabinet had made efforts over the past few years to nurture innovation, noting that a social innovation lab had been set up last year.</p>
<p>“I personally provide (open) office hours at the social innovation lab every Wednesday, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Anyone who is interested in social innovation is welcomed to have a discussion with me,” Tang said.</p>
<p>Tang, the 37-year-old software- programmer-turned-public servant, said that she has been in the startup community since the age of 15.</p>
<p>“Being an entrepreneur at heart, I’m glad to see the Global Entrepreneurship Congress Plus Taipei providing a great opportunity to exchange ideas and pitches from different teams, and to have stimulating conversations,” she said.</p>
<p>“I look forward to seeing more entrepreneurs devote more time to the challenges and the problems at stake, namely how to turn your idea into a scalable business, and overcome those challenges every entrepreneur must face,” Tang said.</p>

<p>As part of that search, it’s planning major investments in Taiwan. Taiwan’s strengths in high tech make it appealing for investment, Samsung NEXT managing director Raymond Liao said.</p>
<p>Samsung NEXT has invested in 78 companies in different countries. It accepts fewer than 10 of the 1,000 firms that apply for capital every year, according to a Business Next report. The venture capital fund looks for firms with a record of innovation and perseverance, Liao said. Some invested firms should also big enough to work eventually with Samsung, he said.</p>
<p>A firm that’s well enough established might consider merging with Samsung, Liao added.<br />
“With some teams, it’s like love at first sight,” he said on the sidelines of 2018 Computex Taipei earlier this month.</p>
<p>The 5-year-old <a title="http://samsungnext.com/our-approach/" href="http://samsungnext.com/our-approach/">venture capital firm</a> focuses on investments in the software and services behind augmented reality, internet of things, blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, its website says. An offshoot fund goes toward emerging AI technology.</p>
<p>Liao did not give details on plans for Taiwan but indicated that Samsung NEXT had been checking out local startups quietly for some time.</p>
<h2>How the funding works</h2>
<p>About 70% of Samsung NEXT’s investments are now in the United States and 25% are in Israel. The rest go to firms in Canada, China, India and Europe. Samsung NEXT has about $150 million at its disposal, according to a <a title="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/samsung-next-q-fund/" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/samsung-next-q-fund/">Techcrunch report.</a></p>
<p>The venture capital source cites Kngine, an Egyptian artificial intelligence startup founded in 2009 with capital of $775,000, as a model of how its investments work.</p>
<p>Since being acquired by Samsung NEXT last year, the developer has contributed core technology for Samsung’s <a title="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/" href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/">Bixby</a>, a mobile phone voice assistant like Apple’s Siri and Google’s Alexa.</p>
<p>Another example: The mobile payment company LoopPay, a 12-year-old American firm with $10 million in investment, is contributing technology to Samsung Pay following a Samsung NEXT investment.</p>
<p>Future investments will be “decentralized&#8221; and may move more toward blockchain technology, Liao said. Other types of emerging technology have their limits, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data analysis and backend technology will be valuable,” Liao said. “Small data is simply not worthwhile as it is only useful if the amount of data is large enough, which is currently in the hands of only a few big companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samsung NEXT anticipates blockchain will advance the sharing economy by allowing information to be evenly distributed and exchanged with no intermediary.</p>
<p>Liao gave the example of Filament, An American firm started in 2012 with capital of $22million. It makes blockchain-enabled chips for industrial uses such as shipping containers. Samsung NEXT invested in it four years ago.</p>

<p>“Taiwan is the first nation in Asia to legalize gay marriage,” said the company&#8217;s chief technology officer Scott Chen Jun-yang, who will head Grindr’s office in Taiwan.</p>
<p>“It is an open society that is tolerant of sexual minorities.</p>
<p>“It also has strong tech talents that are relatively affordable,” he said.</p>
<p>The company, which has 40 million registered users worldwide, has just constructed an office in the Xinyi Breeze Center.</p>
<p>Chen is currently recruiting software engineers, offering handsome pay packages that range from an annual NT$1.5 to NT$3 million.</p>
<p>Chen, who joined Facebook early on to help develop the company’s machine learning algorithms, said he is searching for specialists in DevOps, Java back-end management, Android and iOS systems.</p>
<p>“Taiwanese have a strong work ethic and are reliable employees,” said Chen, who obtained a doctorate at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>“There are no limits for those at the top of their game,” said Chen, meaning that he would lavishly reward employees who had suitable talent.</p>
<p>The company declined to give further details about its plans for its Taiwan operations.</p>
<p>Grindr actively leverages the ecosystem of the “pink economy” – a term which refers to products and services catering to sexual minorities. It was acquired from founder Joel Simkhaiby by Chinese tech firm Kunlun Tech at the start of this year for US$152 million.</p>
<p>Grindr’s business model centers on generating revenues from membership fees and advertising. More than 3.8 million of its registered users use the app daily.</p>
<p>Grindr sees the &#8220;pink economy&#8221; in Taiwan as having potential. Its business plans dovetail with the Taiwanese government’s ambitions to utilize Taiwan’s open culture to make the island a hub.</p>
<p>In addition to its welcoming attitude to the LGBT community, Taiwan is one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies. Its media has been ranked the freest in Asia, according to the World Press Freedom Index released by Reporters Without Borders.</p>

<p>The app, iHAC, uses telecommunications and information and communications technology to match up patients with 15 different kinds of medical service providers, including doctors, nurses, dietitians and physical therapists.</p>
<p>“Uber matches car owners and riders. Airbnb brings house owners and travelers together&#8230; Mediot connects medical people and users,” said Cary Hsieh, who founded Mediot in April 2017.</p>
<p>It will be available in the Taiwanese market in August. Users will be able to access the service from their smartphones or computers.</p>
<h2>An Uber-like Platform in the Healthcare Sector</h2>
<p>It is normally easy to find medical treatment in Taiwanese towns as they have densely-located clinics and hospitals.</p>
<p>However, this easy access has caused some people to over-use medical resources, causing doctors to be overburdened and preventing some people in urgent need of help from receiving immediate medical attention.</p>
<p>Hsieh said medical resources could be used more efficiently if patients who don’t need comprehensive personal checkups go online for some consultations. The company thus developed iHAC to eliminate unnecessary trips to hospitals and clinics.</p>
<p>Mediot estimates some 60% of medical consultations and tasks can be conducted long distance using telecommunications technologies and 14% of them can be conducted online.</p>
<p>For example, some patients with chronic diseases need consultations with several doctors to fully understand their diagnoses.</p>
<p>It normally takes several days involving lengthy commutes to meet each doctor in person. With iHAC, users can communicate with multiple doctors online without leaving home in a much shorter period of time.</p>
<p>iHAC also provides online consultation services. Users can determine the hospital department or clinic they need to visit for treatment of their symptoms. This avoids tedious queuing behind hospital information desks.</p>
<p>Mediot is also cooperating with various doctors who perform physical examinations. After patients&#8217; consultations, doctors explain their reports online through iHAC, eliminating the need for a second hospital visit.</p>
<p>The app can also simulate real medical consultations on mobile devices by using augmented reality technology when presenting some items, such as X-Ray files.</p>
<p>The app has been created in accordance with U.S. legislative requirements for the protection of data privacy and related security provisions.</p>
<p>After this, Mediot joined 2017 Taipei Next Star, a startup accelerator program supported by the Taipei City Government&#8217;s Department of Economic Development.</p>
<p>Mediot&#8217;s founder Hsieh said he first became inspired to work with telemedicine after he earlier developed a wearable device that could detect uterus contractions. After he patented his invention, he found there was not much interest in Taiwan’s healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Although it saved time for doctors, they needed to spend extra time checking online reports. He realized his invention and other wearable devices were more useful if they were used in long-distance treatments.</p>
<p>&#8220;When there is distance between patients and medical service providers, healthcare wearable devices really have values. For example, with patients who have high blood pressure and diabetes, doctors can know more precisely their daily blood sugar levels, temperature and blood pressure variations if patients wear wearables.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Taking iHAC to the Chinese Market</h2>
<p>Hsieh sees potential in the vast Chinese market. As a first step, Mediot is partnering with the Eslite Hotel in Taipei to provide medical tourism packages for Chinese tourists that gives them an experience of telemedicine in addition to traditional Western medical treatments.</p>
<p>He is also in negotiations with various Chinese shopping malls over potential collaborations. Hsieh wants to set up stands in these shopping malls for shoppers to experience telemedicine. Mediot can then provide them with the app and its services at their homes if they are interested.</p>

<h5><strong>Heading an Inclusive Economy in Asian Pacific Ring and Aiming at the Silver Booms in Chinese Speaking Markets</strong></h5>
<p>Two facts in 2025 that we should not ignore and must take action now: (1) 70% of the global population will be living in the top 100 big cities; (2) 20% of city&#8217;s population will be over 65 and need accessibility services.<br />

<p>The partnership with the international investment bank took effect in May. It’s expected to help Robo Web make LnB more mainstream, company founder and CEO Joanna Yang said.</p>
<p>The 3-year-old online lending service differs from traditional lenders by offering peer-to-peer lending—also known as P2P lending. That process lets people borrow money from other individuals instead of from an institutional lender.</p>
<p>“LnB’s goal is to enable customers with funding needs to find lenders with ease and convenience over the internet,” Yang said at an event in May. “The spirit of financial technology is to create new values for customers.”</p>
<p>LnB, which stands for Lend &amp; Borrow, is Taiwan’s largest online peer-to-peer lending platform according to a report in Taiwan’s Business Weekly. LnB was founded in 2015 and a year later it landed a multi-million-dollar series A round funding from Acorn Campus Ventures.</p>
<p>The lending service had 37,000 customers as of mid-May and had helped arrange more than NT$5.1 billion (US$170.61 million) in loans.</p>
<p>LnB faces competitions from large and established players such as the world’s biggest online lender LendingClub, the second largest lender Social Finance, and San-Francisco based lender Prosper.</p>
<h2>Details of the deal with Standard Chartered</h2>
<p>As LnB’s first bank partner, Standard Chartered will be able to use LnB to attract younger customers to apply for bank loans online.</p>
<p>Customers will first apply for LnB loans and those rejected will be passed on to Standard Chartered for reapplication, all via the LnB online system.</p>
<p>LnB representatives will be able to recommend the bank’s personal loans options to customers who got rejected from the peer-to-peer service. LnB says its loan approval requirements are stricter than those of commercial banks. But the peer-to-peer service calls its process faster and easier compared to that of a bank.</p>
<p>Yang, 49, is the former manager of Far Eastern International Bank’s personal banking. She brings more than 20 years of extensive banking industry experience to her startup.</p>
<p>LnB targets customers ages 20 to 50 for loans. The application process gives newer borrowers a sense of how much money they should ask for, Yang said. Approval takes as little as three-and-a-half minutes and the loan can be delivered in 24 hours, she said.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered hopes to do more with digital banking as it’s a new trend, the bank’s personal banking head for Taiwan Kate Lin told a media event in May. Online banking was valued at US$64 billion in 2015 and could hit US$1 trillion in 2025, according to a Taipei Times report.</p>
<p>“We aim to reach out to the general public through the strategic cooperation, a departure from the past focus on high-net-worth individuals,” Lin said. “The partnership shows that the bank is serious about growing its personal banking business in Taiwan.”</p>

<p>Nine Taiwanese startups selected by the ministry also took part in the two-day event held in the city state at the end of June. The event was organized by <a title="https://e27.co" href="https://e27.co/">e27</a>, an online Singaporean technology media company, which estimated more than 5000 people from 30 nations attended.</p>
<p>The move was part of the government’s New Southbound Policy for developing business and social ties with Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.</p>
<p>Elley Yang, an member of Taiwan Tech Arena , noted Taiwan had much to learn from Singapore’s regulations and management of its startup ecosystem, considered to be more advanced.</p>
<p>“In the light of the New Southbound Policy, we have brought these startups to Singapore to give them more opportunities. They can make more connections and put on displays for potential investors and partners,” Yang said.</p>
<h2>Two Participating Taiwanese Startups Describe their Visions</h2>
<p><a title="https://picsee.co" href="https://picsee.co/">PicSee</a>, founded in 2016 and based in Taipei City, helps customers create eye-catching preview links with personalized headlines and customized thumbnail sizes for sharing on social media.</p>
<p>Its main product is the Link Shortener, which shortens URL links The company says this product can help social media users gain more visibility on apps including Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Wu Cheng-Ho, PicSee’s co-founder, said that most of his company’s customers were involved in marketing and were interested in statistics that could help analyze their customers’ behavior, such as how many clicks a particular website received.</p>
<p>Previously only engineers generally had the skills to obtain these kinds of statistics. However the Link Shortener in a breakthrough can provide professional marketers analytical data and statistics derived from either websites or mobile apps.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup’s most rapid growth has been in Southeast Asia, which contributes to 30% of clicks on the company’s websites.</p>
<p>“We are aiming for rapid growth in the Southeast Asian region and that’s why we are here joining Taiwan Tech Arena to display our services at Echelon,” Ho said.</p>
<p>“Plus we would like to introduce our services to other startups here. People involved in startups are usually open to innovative ideas so we hope there are opportunities to make other startups here our clients,” Ho said.</p>
<p>One leading cause of traffic accidents is driver fatigue. In France, for example, this causes 21% of all road deaths, says Morris Chuang, the business manager of startup Face Heart.</p>
<p>In response, Face Heart has created a product called “e-Bus”. A small device installed inside a car automatically monitors the physiological status and behavior of drivers using face detection and recognition technologies.</p>
<p>“What is most worth knowing is that there is no need to put on a wearable device,” Chuang said.</p>
<p>Chuang said his company took part in the Echelon Asia Summit in the hopes it could find partnerships with transportation companies to help with its market expansion.</p>

<p>The platform, which is owned by Taiwanese internet company <a title="https://global.pchome.com.tw/english/" href="https://global.pchome.com.tw/english/">PChome Online</a>, is a household name in Taiwan After going public in 2011, PChome Store was a market leader until it was upended by Singapore’s Shopee, an app-based e-commerce platform of a type rarely seen in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The impact caused PChome Store to report an annual net loss of NT$10.6 million last year its first-ever loss since going public. In the first quarter of this year, there was another resounding loss of NT$927 million.</p>
<p>“We were too slow turning from web to mobile, and weren’t powerful enough,” said Jan Hung-tze, PChome Online’s chairman at a recent start-up social event held by Meet.</p>
<p>The company was once a star player in the Taiwanese market. Founded in 1996, it began as a portal website. It later spun off its e-commerce platform, PChome Store in 2010 as a separate company.</p>
<p>PChome Store went on to become the first port of call for Taiwanese online shoppers searching the internet for product information, even outdoing Google which came in second, according to a survey conducted last year by the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting Institute, a non-governmental organization in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The survey also found that when Taiwanese online shoppers wanted to buy a given product, most would click on PChome Store first, before trying Google and Yahoo!.</p>
<p>The company claims its e-commerce site offers the widest range of goods in Taiwan with more than 240 million purchase options. In addition to a business-to-consumer platform, PChome Online offers customer-to-customer transactions, where anyone using its platform can sell their individual belongings to another netizen, similar to eBay in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Shopee Comes to Taiwan</h2>
<p>Storm clouds appeared on the horizon when Singapore’s Shopee, originally an e-commerce platform offering customer-to-customer transactions, entered the Taiwanese market in October 2015.</p>
<p>Owned by Sea Group, a Singaporean internet company which has China’s Tencent as an investor, Shopee’s e-commerce transactions are conducted via a mobile app.</p>
<p>In this way, Shopee successfully differentiated itself from other Taiwanese e-commerce businesses, including PChome Store, which mostly used web platforms and didn’t provide mobile-friendly interfaces.</p>
<p>Consumers found using an app was useful: buyers could quickly text sellers any questions they might have and sellers could reply directly using the app’s messaging feature. And this could be done anywhere provided users were carrying mobile devices, such as smartphones.</p>
<p>Shopee managed to attract hordes of new online sellers through social media. These kinds of people habitually did not use web platforms like PChome Store.</p>
<p>Shopee also entered the Taiwanese market with a strategy of offering free delivery, which Taiwanese companies hadn’t thought of offering before. It spent overall NT$6 billion on marketing in Taiwan from 2016 to early 2018.</p>
<p>By July 2016, Shopee was claiming to have over 3 million app downloads and 10 million transactions every month in Taiwan. Then, in February 2018, the company claimed its app had been downloaded 12 million times, making it the most downloaded e-commerce app in the nation. During the same month, 15 million items in Taiwan were sold through Shopee.</p>
<p>In 2017, Shopee started to charge some delivery fees, then in March 2018 it announced a new business-to-consumer 24-hour delivery shopping service in Taiwan.</p>
<p>To catch up with this foreign competition, PChome Store began to provide free deliveries and cut product prices while increasing its operation costs. Meanwhile its losses mounted.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s Like a &#8220;Battle&#8221;</h2>
<p>Jan said that creating a successful e-commerce platform is like a “battle,” with the victor the company able to throw the most resources into marketing, free delivery and cheap deals.</p>
<p>Amazon, an U.S. e-commerce giant, was an example, Jan said. The company started its business selling books online discounted at 20% to 40% It spent money offering these discounts to encourage consumers to change their behavior and make online purchases rather than visit bookstores.</p>
<p>“The purpose of massive investments is to change consumers’ behavior. After the user base has gained enough scale, the platform … probably wins the market,” Jan said.</p>
<p>However, Taiwanese internet businesses had never participated in such a “battle,” nor spent large chunks of capital in investing in marketing, as Shopee did, Jan said.</p>
<p>“So when this came, we didn’t know how to respond,” Jan said.</p>
<p>Shopee is not yet profitable. It pours investment into its business aiming for rising sales as its costs are mounting. However, sales figures and growth are the language its executives use to talk its investors to make them believe it will make money in the future, Jan said.</p>
<p>Sea Group, Shopee’s parent company, which went public in 2017, is positioning itself as a leading internet company in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“It has reach in the Southeast Asian region and Taiwan,” said Jan.</p>
<p>E-commerce businesses tend to be more profitable investments in internet-savvy Taiwan compared with Southeastern Asian nations, with total numbers of e-commerce sales in the nation 20% more than total retail sales.</p>
<p>“Shopee can tell a very valuable story to its investors. When it works, it isn’t expensive to spend NT$6 billion in Taiwan (on marketing),” said Jan.</p>

Watson Research Center.</p>
<p>He never imagined that one day he would found a company in the U.S. but after working for IBM for 17 years, he started to see entrepreneurship opportunities.</p>
<p>He founded <a title="http://www.graphen.ai" href="http://www.graphen.ai/">Graphen</a> one year ago offering advanced AI technologies based on graphs. The company’s website says graphs play a key role in mimicking the human experience of intelligence.</p>
<p>Lin recently shared his experience of being a U.S.-based Taiwanese entrepreneur with Business Next at his firm&#8217;s New York headquarters.</p>
<p>The main thing Taiwanese entrepreneurs need to know is that they should not solve industrial problems by offering existing solutions that everyone’s already heard of, Lin said.</p>
<p>Instead, startup founders need to think deeply and outside-the-box to come up with original solutions that exceed both customers’ and the markets’ expectations, Lin said.</p>
<p>In addition, Taiwanese founders should locate their businesses in target markets that are abundant with talent.</p>
<p>Giving Graphen as an example, Lin said he chose to locate his company in New York as his company is a technology startup that creates AI solutions for the financial industry.</p>
<p>“It’s no exaggeration to say that New York is the perfect place for us to launch because it’s the financial capital of the world,” Lin said.</p>
<p>“Graphen’s success comes partly because its AI talent hails from the computer science departments of top-tier American universities.”</p>
<p>Lin said he was endeavoring to create unique AI technologies to help major banks counter money laundering.</p>
<p>“Large banks are …facing challenges such as countering laundering and debt management. These are the bank&#8217;s key ‘pain points’ that still need to be solved,” Lin said.</p>
<p>“It’s important to ask yourself: is your solution solving a real ‘pain point’?”</p>
<p>Many major banks are looking to startups to for new technology in response to the cutting-edge technologies used by American regulators and other government officials to catch banks that are not following the rules.</p>
<p>This follows a series of scandals. Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined US$10 billion for its involvement in a Russian money-laundering scheme. Taiwan’s Mega Bank also got fined US$29 million by the US Federal Reserve for violating an anti-money laundering act in January.</p>
<p>Lin noted that top U.S. banks are more interested in collaborating with startups than smaller banks in order to keep up with the latest technology and competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;In New York, the bigger the banks are, the faster they rush in. In part, it’s because they can’t afford to slow down. It’s a highly competitive environment. They need to innovate as fast as they can. You will find that only small and medium-sized banks are conservative and reluctant to change,”Lin said.</p>
<p>Founded in June last year, the firm’s success in part comes from Lin’s extensive industry experience and his well-established reputation in both the IT industry and the financial services sector.</p>
<p>Graphen develops AI-powered financial technology platforms for a number of purposes that include monitoring of core banking functions, loan risk prediction and anti-money laundering. There’s also AI-enabled regulation and compliance, fraud detection, market intelligence and AI trading.</p>
<p>“Artificial Intelligence technologies quickly evolve. Inspired by the human brain being a graph of billions of nodes and trillions of edges, our R&amp;D has focused on achieving AI through novel graph computing foundations since mid 2000s,”Lin said.</p>
<p>“With a graph structure, computers can better emulate the full function of human brains, including memory, sensing, recognition, perception, comprehension, and strategy,”</p>
<p>Besides his role at Graphen, Lin has also been an adjunct professor at Columbia University since 2005 and at New York University since 2014.</p>
<p>Headquartered in New York, Graphen. currently has branches and subsidiaries in Taipei, Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, and Austin.</p>

<p>A report by Startup Genome and the Global Entrepreneurship Network, which analyzed more than 60 countries, estimated Taipei has around 150 to 350 startups, compared with a global average of 1700 and Hong Kong’s over 450.</p>
<p>The survey, Global Startup Ecosystems Report 2018 released on April 17, also found that Taipei&#8217;s Ecosystem Value – a measure for assessing an ecosystem’s size and performance that amounts to the sum of all startups&#8217; valuations and exit values &#8212; stood at over $580 million.</p>
<p>The figure is lower than the global median at $4.1 billion, Hong Kong’s $2.2 billion, and New York City’s $71 billion.</p>
<p>The report did find, however, that the overseas market penetration of Taipei’s startups, at 28%, exceeded the global average of 23%. Taiwan’s average early stage startup funding of US$25,5000 was also slightly higher than the global average of US$252000.</p>
<p>Taiwanese entrepreneurs were also found to be relatively experienced. About 65% of Taiwanese startup engineering teams already had a few years experience working for startups, compared with a global average of 72%.</p>
<p>The survey covering startup, investment, and policy insights in 45 cities including Taipei also highlighted Taipei’s strengths in AI, advanced manufacturing, robotics, and biotech.</p>
<p>The report also mentioned Appier, one of the hottest Taiwanese startups in the AI sector in a section of the report devoted to AI and Big Data. It noted the Taiwanese AI startup, which helps companies make marketing decisions and has raised over US$80 million in total funding, was recently ranked one of the 100 most promising private artificial intelligence companies in the world by CB Insights.</p>
<p>It also noted that one of the driving forces behind Taipei’s startup ecosystem is Taiwanese accelerator and VC fund AppWorks, whose 323 alumni are generating a combined annual revenue of $1 billion.</p>
<p>“With more support from the public sector through policy making and other initiatives, startups have been accepted as imperative for the long-term development of society; more and more global and regional investors, startups, and serial entrepreneurs seriously consider Taiwan as an attractive destination,” said Katie Chen, CEO of Business Next in the report.</p>
<p>The survey stated that Taiwan’s citizens are tech-savvy, with 88% connected to the internet and 70% owning a smartphone—one of the largest penetrations worldwide.</p>
<p>It also noted that some of the world’s largest tech companies were created in Taiwan, such as Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturing company.</p>
<p>Although Taipei needed to do more work, the report expressed confidence in Taipei’s potential.</p>
<p>“Taipei City stands a good chance to develop a globally competitive startup ecosystem,” the report said.</p>
<p>The survey amalgamated the voices of more than 10,000 startup founders as well as data from startup database Crunchbase and data company Orb Intelligence. The results were geared to inform public and private decision makers on how to better create startup ecosystems.</p>
<p>Business Next is the first Taiwanese network partner of Startup Genome, a U.S.-based organization that researches startup ecosystems. The Taipei-based media group acted as a representative of Taiwanese startup ecosystem and contributed to the survey during the second half of 2017.</p>
<p>For this survey, Business Next reached out to Taiwan-based startup ecosystem leaders, including Garage+, AppWorks, Taiwan Startup Stadium, Taiwan Startup Hub, Taiwan Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, Startup@Taipei, and Anchor Taiwan to gather and present data that best represented the Taipei startup ecosystem.</p>

Plans to Help Taiwanese Entrepreneurs Break into the American Market', '2018-07-13', 'news', '<p>Austin-based startup accelerator <a title="https://www.steepaccelerator.com" href="https://www.steepaccelerator.com/">STEEP!</a>, otherwise known as the Supporting Taiwanese Entrepreneurs Everywhere Project, plans to invest in seven Taiwanese startups within the next two years.</p>
<p>The accelerator’s co-founder Erica Liu spoke with Business Next during the <a title="https://www.computextaipei.com.tw" href="https://www.computextaipei.com.tw/">2018 Computex Taipei</a> trade show earlier this month. The interview took place at the XR Express Taiwan Pavilion, sponsored by Taiwan’s National Development Council.</p>
<p>The pavilion showcased the latest trends in augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed reality technologies from 15 young companies. There was also a series of forums on industry trends and startup communities, where Liu was one of the speakers.</p>
<p>The following Q&amp;A explains STEEP!’s background and what it plans to do:</p>
<p><strong>Q:Tell us about yourself? What inspired you to found STEEP! in 2017?.</strong></p>
<p>A: I&#8217;m a Taiwanese American currently based in Austin, Texas. My childhood was spent in Taiwan and then I moved to the US when I was nine years old. My background is in international tax. I have a Master&#8217;s degree in professional accounting from University of Texas at Austin. I’m also one of the founding members of the Austin Chapter of Taiwanese American Professionals (TAP).</p>
<p>In March 2017, I helped Taiwanese companies connect with the largest tech conference in Austin known as South by Southwest or SXSW. I observed that Taiwanese companies tended to make great products but lacked networks and resources that could enable them to enter U.S. markets.</p>
<p>My friends and I then started to think about how we could use our strong professional networks in the States to help Taiwanese companies grow. What would it be like if Taiwanese startup founders had mentors and partners in the U.S. that they could reach out to whenever they needed help?</p>
<p>As the founding president of TAP in Austin, I’m constantly seeking ways to empower Taiwanese Americans or Taiwanese who wish to tap into the American market. And that’s how STEEP! was born.</p>
<p><strong>Q:What&#8217;s your goal? Your vision?</strong></p>
<p>A: We think that many people with Taiwanese heritage have a proven track record in the U.S. A lot of great companies like NVIDIA and YouTube were created by talented Taiwanese Americans. What STEEP! wants to do is empower Taiwanese startup founders to take their companies to the global stage, which is vital for their future success.</p>
<p>Taiwanese entrepreneurs can become successful internationally but they need access to knowledge, resources and funding beyond Taiwan. Our vision is to help the Taiwanese startup ecosystem become more like the Israeli ecosystem, where founders give back.</p>
<p><strong>Q:What are some of the programs that STEEP! Accelerator has been working on?</strong></p>
<p>A:At STEEP!, an online solution we provide is called “STEEP! Web,” which helps accelerate your path to exploring the U.S. market.</p>
<p>STEEP! Web is a web platform and database that fosters a sense of community and mentorship between US entrepreneurs, business leaders, community leaders and Taiwanese founders so that they can learn from each other. We make introductions for seed stage to Pre-A companies needing a network for growth.</p>
<p>We also have a mentoring program where Taiwanese startup founders have a unique chance to get advice with mentors on a one-on-one basis. It&#8217;s a great way for entrepreneurs to reflect on their business strategy, marketing strategy and product development.</p>
<p><strong>Q:How many Taiwanese startups have you invested in? What&#8217;s the size of your fund?</strong></p>
<p>A: So far we have invested in only one Taiwanese startup company. But our investment is not only limited to Taiwanese-founded companies in Taiwan. We also consider the U.S., and elsewhere in the world. Companies we invest in will be supported by mentors from our STEEP! Web network.</p>
<p>We are still fund raising. Startups can expect angel check sizes to be US$25, 000 to US$50,000. Right now our total capital is $US75,000. We plan to invest in seven Taiwanese startup companies this year and next year.</p>
<p><strong>Q:What are some of the sources of your funding?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our funding comes from Taiwanese American high-net-worth individuals. It&#8217;s U.S. culture to allocate a portion of your wealth to risky projects. Our angel investors tend to be folks who want to invest not only in a good idea but also in the community they represent.</p>
<p>A lot of them have very traditional jobs, as well. Many of them are lawyers and doctors. For them, making their way in the U.S. was diligently working their way up to the top, but they realize that someone else&#8217;s dream may be something entirely different. They want to help future generations shape their dreams in the U.S., as well.</p>
<p><strong>Q:Tell us about the startup you&#8217;ve invested in?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have invested in a Taiwanese startup company called <a title="http://www.bioinspira.com" href="http://www.bioinspira.com/">BioInspira.</a> They are a chemical sensing IoT company. What they do is use virus technology to detect specific air chemicals. In particular, they can pinpoint chemical leaks. Right now, they are developing ammonia sensors that are used in cold warehousing to ensure industrial safety.</p>
<p><strong>Q:What’s the biggest challenge Taiwanese entrepreneurs face when approaching an American investor?</strong></p>
<p>A: The biggest challenge that Taiwanese founders face when approaching an American investor is crafting their story. It&#8217;s about story telling. I think language is a big barrier. When I do see Taiwanese companies do well at this is when they specifically seek out a co-founder who is very skilled at pitching and sales. I honestly think the biggest barrier is just language. Also, entrepreneurs should be able to charm an audience: they should essentially have story-telling skills.</p>
<p>The U.S. investors tend to look for something that is obvious. They want a good bet. Why are you the best person to solve this problem? What kind of special advantage do you have compared with everyone else? These are some of the things that they look for.</p>
<p><strong>Q:What’s next for STEEP!?</strong></p>
<p>A: We are currently in talks with the managers of Taiwan Startup Stadium (TTS) and SparkLab to grow the startup community and to help more Taiwanese founders get access to people based in the U.S. I think that hiring people may be our biggest challenge and leveraging the existing pool of talent is one thing we&#8217;ll be working on.</p>
<p>We’re looking to invest in more startups and so getting recommendations from friends or from our networks is something we&#8217;ll be doing too.</p>

<p>Jointly organized by the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Kaohsiung City Government, the two-day forum aims to foster digital transformation among SMEs and new ventures from across the region through promoting integration of innovations in fields spanning artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, financial technology and Internet of Things. Attendees include industry heavyweights such as Airbnb, IBM and Google as well as almost 100 startups from home and abroad, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>The seminar will include emerging technology presentations, international investment and networking meetings, panel discussions and pitch sessions for startups. The following day, a workshop will be staged for participants on digital resilience.</p>
<p>Speaking at the opening ceremony, MOEA Minister Shen Jong-chin said the summit is the largest event under the APEC O2O Initiative this year and provides an ideal platform for enterprises to share best practices on boosting growth in the digital age.</p>
<p>According to Shen, rapid technological development is reshaping business models for SMEs, the backbone of economic prosperity across the region. Modern solutions enable such enterprises to more readily access overseas markets, but also expose them to new risks such as cybersecurity threats, he said, adding that the seminar will help SMEs tap economic opportunities while guarding against emerging dangers.</p>
<p>Launched in 2015 by Taiwan in cooperation with the Philippines, the four-year APEC O2O Initiative seeks to enhance the digital competitiveness and resilience of SMEs as well as build a global network of related experts. The seminar is part of the third phase of the program, which also comprises events in Vietnam and the Philippines in August and October, respectively.</p>
<p>Renowned for its vibrant, internationally competitive SME sector, Taiwan is a bellwether in associated policy development as well as a global leader in digital technology and innovative entrepreneurship. Since 2003, it has proposed initiatives annually under APEC aimed at strengthening SME growth throughout the region.</p>
<p>According to the MOEA, these efforts are also in line with the New Southbound Policy. A key component of the government’s national development strategy, the policy seeks to deepen Taiwan’s agricultural, business, cultural, educational, tourism and trade ties with the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states, six South Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Here are some of the 20 firms showcased at Computex:</p>

<p>This 2-year-old Russian software company offers on-demand photo recognition for brands, faces, products and objects. The software can recognize these features based on photos or videos on websites or in the social media.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.clevapi.com" href="http://www.clevapi.com/">Clevapi</a> CEO Timur Luguev told Business Next his software-as-a-service technology combines real-time visual recognition with artificial intelligence. Clients might need the service in retail or personalized customer support.</p>
<p>Luguev said he came to Taiwan in search of business partners, so he applied to Garage+ and has already held some meetings on the island.</p>
<h2>Edgehog: anti-reflection light management</h2>
<p><a title="http://www.edgehogtech.com" href="http://www.edgehogtech.com/">Edgehog</a> , founded in 2017 in Montreal, is developing anti-reflection technology that allows screens to be readable under direct sunlight while cutting power consumption.</p>
<p>Edgehog co-founder Calvin Cheng said commercial applications include camera lenses, glasses, smartphone screens and solar panels. Cheng, too, reached Taiwan to find business partners in manufacturing.</p>
<h2>CamToy: robotic pet sitter</h2>
<p>The French startup <a title="https://www.adoptlaika.com" href="https://www.adoptlaika.com/">CamToy</a> has developed a robot called Laika. Laika acts as a companion for pet dogs so they don’t feel lonely while their owners are away.</p>
<p>CamToy co-founder and CEO Thomas Samtmann adopted a dog named Kimi from a shelter for strays.</p>
<p>”Probably the dog suffered from its abandonment as the dog would destroy things at home when I was away from her,” Samtmann said. “Therefore, I came up with this idea to have the robot to accompany my pet so the pet could feel secure and so the owner ourselves could understand the pet’s condition anytime.”</p>
<p>An owner of the Laika kit can put a tracker on the dog to get notices via WiFi on a mobile phone app of any unusual behavior such as repeated barking. Laika interacts with the dog by teaching tricks and tossing out treats. Cats qualify, too.</p>
<p>“With the tracker, Laïka is also able to know when your dog is active and where he is in your house,” the CEO said. “So even when you&#8217;re busy, Laïka can take care of your dog.”</p>
<p>CamToy’s”Laika” has won CES Innovation Award 2018. Now people can pre-order Laika on <a title="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/laika-an-interactive-companion-for-you-your-dog-dogs-pets#/" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/laika-an-interactive-companion-for-you-your-dog-dogs-pets#/">Indiegogo</a>.

<p>The ministry formally created <a title="http://taiwanarena.tech" href="http://taiwanarena.tech/">Taiwan Tech Arena</a>, the government’s first incubator, to foster “a vibrant international tech startup ecosystem in Taiwan,” Minister Chen Liang-gee told a news conference June 5.</p>
<p>“The purpose of launching Taiwan Tech Arena is to help Taiwanese startups gain more visibility in global markets,” he told reporters. “One of Taiwan Tech Arena’s goals is to build an international tech startup environment in Taiwan by building a strong network.”</p>
<p>Taiwan Tech Arena will spawn 100 startups per year and expedite the overseas expansion of 300 over the next three years, the minister added.</p>
<p>The incubator is inside the Taipei Arena, a 13-year-old former baseball stadium in the Taiwan capital city. Arena funding of NT$1.5 billion (about $50 million USD) comes from the ministry and the Taiwan government’s Industrial Technology Research Institute will manage it.</p>
<p>Specific programs at Taiwan Tech Arena will encourage growth of domestic high-tech companies and link them to markets overseas.</p>
<p>Taiwanese entrepreneurs have an edge over their peers in hardware and has great AI talents to build the next-generation products, Chen said. To supplement that, he said, the ministry has invested in software development and artificial intelligence over the past few years.</p>
<p>To that end, the arena’s initial programs will cover talent development, software technology, cloud computing and ways to turn their ideas quickly into realistic proofs of concept.</p>
<p>Tech Arena programs will bring in talent from companies, academic research, international accelerators and capital markets.</p>
<p>Startups will find mentors, workshops and face-to-face consultation. Among its foreign partners are the startup accelerators 500 Startups, Sparklabs and Techstars from the United States and Startupsbootcamp from the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“We have a strong network of global mentors, investors, and resources that will help elevate startups teams’ work to global audiences,” the minister said.</p>

<p>Business Next reporters reached out to the experts for insight following the release of the Global Startup Ecosystems Report 2018, an analysis of more than 60 startup ecosystems in 24 countries.</p>
<p>The sum of the startup and exit values of new firms in Taipei comes to $580 million, the survey found. That’s less than the global median of $4.1 billion, Hong Kong’s $2.2 billion and New York City’s $71 billion. The number of startups in Taipei ranks between 150 to 350, as compared to a global average of 1700. Hong Kong placed at 450 to 850.</p>
<h2>Silicon Valley exposure</h2>
<p>Chien Chih-yu, Taiwanese venture capitalist with Silicon Valley-based AME Cloud Ventures, said last month that Taiwanese entrepreneurs must pay special attention to investment trends in his part of the United States. A lot of Taiwan’s startups use high tech, which is the sector that anchors Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t just keep your head down and do everything on your own,” Chien said, as cited in an April 18 commentary by Business Next editor James Huang. “If you don’t know what the mainstream investors are looking for, for example, what the hottest topics are, or the latest trends in investing, it’ll be difficult to stay relevant.”</p>
<p>Taiwan needs mostly to send more people for longer periods to the Silicon Valley to observe the tech scene closely and make connections, Chien said. Today, he said, Taiwanese founders normally send just one or two project coordinators for short stays.</p>
<h2>Marketing and business skills</h2>
<p>Taiwan is good at developing core technologies, another expert said, but it takes good marketing and business operation skills to sell that technology overseas.</p>
<p>“The emerging technologies and innovations require a different approach to develop because of (the) unique market,” said Jordan Wen, professor with the Graduate Institute of Technology, Innovation &amp; Intellectual Property Management at National Chengchi University in Taipei.</p>
<p>“Taiwanese startups can no longer rely solely on technologies to enter the market,” Wen told the Business Next editor in an interview. “They have to take operation skills along and consider the means of business strategies before the can finally break into global markets.”</p>
<p>Taiwanese startups that recruit foreign talent to Taiwan should further consider how those employees eventually fit in, Wen added.</p>
<p>“For instance, Taiwanese would converse in Mandarin during meetings and work discussions,” he said. “What is the design that we can create for international talents in hopes of lowering the frustration of blending into Taiwanese culture? What are the educational options for their children? How can we help their spouses quickly adapt to the society?”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s legislative Yuan passed the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals in October to let foreigners interested extend visas for work in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan faces challenges growing its startup ecosystem because many top talents graduating from prestigious universities such as National Taiwan University would rather enter big corporations than work for high-risk startup companies, cultural commentator Chia-chun Chang said.</p>
<p>Younger graduates are keener on meeting their parent’s expectations, including pursuit of careers that provide stability.</p>
<p>“The education system of Taiwan’s entire country, from elementary schools, middle schools to higher education, has stressed too much on unquestioned obedience, getting credits and marks, and focused too little on creativity, self-exploration, and experimentation,” Chang told Business Next. “The system has to change in order to nurture and prepare the next generation of creative leaders in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>The survey released in April amalgamated the voices of more than 10,000 startup founders as well as data from startup database Crunchbase and data company Orb Intelligence. The results are geared to inform public and private decision makers about how to build vibrant startup ecosystems.</p>

<p>FunNow will add <a title="https://www.almex.jp" href="https://www.almex.jp/">ALMEX</a>’s hotel lists in Japan to its app and website, allowing Taiwanese users to book them directly. ALMEX in turn will integrate FunNow’s hotels and activities booking list in Taiwan into its service, so Japanese visitors can book in Taiwan through the Japanese interface.</p>
<p>“Partnering with ALMEX will be FunNow’s best strategy to enter the Japanese market,” FunNow co-founder C.C. Chang said in an official statement.</p>
<p>FunNow currently offers booking services in major cities in Taiwan as well as Hong Kong and Okinawa &#8212; a small, outlying part of Japan.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese firm says it can make bookings at more than 2,000 establishments including the Marriott and W hotel chains. The Taiwanese baseball team Chinatrust Brothers also accepts FunNow bookings.</p>
<h2>Expanding in Japan</h2>
<p>ALMEX’s manages properties for more than 4,200 hotels in Japan.</p>
<p>In 2007 it established a own hotel booking website, which has become one of the biggest in Japan. According to FunNow’s statement, the site has almost 1.8 million members and does bookings for 6,800 hotels.</p>
<p>ALMEX hopes its work with FunNow can offer more hotels to members who visit Taiwan. Some of its members now book massages, restaurants and bars near their hotels.</p>
<p>For FunNow users from Taiwan and Hong Kong, they will see hotel options from ALMEX when traveling to Japan. The platform plans to add ALMEX hotels first in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, then gradually expand to other cities in Japan.</p>
<p>According to the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan, more than 4.5 million Taiwanese visited Japan in 2017.</p>
<p>This tie-up is not the first between Taiwanese and Japanese companies. EZTABLE, a restaurant booking service in Taiwan, received investment in 2016 from Ikyu.com, a Japanese website for restaurants and hotel reservations.</p>
<p>Taiwanese tourists can use the FunNow service to reserve a table in restaurants in Japan, and Japanese can reserve them in Taiwan using ALMEX.</p>
<h2>Future expansion in Asia</h2>
<p>FunNow’s app and website show hotels, restaurants and events with space within 24 hours. Customers may be able to grab a discount, too.</p>
<p>FunNow users browse offerings on the platform, reserve and pay within the app. Then they can just visit the dining places or event locations with a series of code they receive after payment, and start their activities.</p>
<p>FunNow links its half-million to 2,000 hotels, restaurants and events.</p>
<p>The firm raised more than US$1.5 million in pre-A round of funding in 2017. China Development Financial Holding Corp., a Taiwanese investment firm, led the round.</p>
<p>FunNow expanded outside of Taiwan for the first time last year. Today 15% of FunNow users are from Hong Kong and Okinawa.</p>
<p>FunNow plans to extend its services to Southeast Asia as well as Japan this year. It forecasts total 2018 sales of NT$500 million (about US$16.8 million).</p>

<p>Sonny Hsiao’s 8-year-old firm Acepodia, Inc., which has offices in Taipei and California, says on its website it is developing antibody cell conjugation, a method of attaching antibodies directly to immune cells as a way of creating anti-cancer T-cell therapies. Acepodia’s result is called ACE-T.</p>
<p>Acepodia describes its invention as “armed” receptors that make T-cells to combat cancer cells, according to a press statement.</p>
<p>The therapy, though not yet clinically proven, shows through lab experiments the potential to be more effective than current therapies, Hsiao said. It will be clinically tested next year, according to a Business Next report.</p>
<p>Doctors normally prescribe chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancers in advanced stages. These treatments usually come with side effects such as hair loss, nausea and abnormal blood cell counts. The T-cell therapy could become an alternative treatment for lung cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Acepodia’s T-cell therapy process should take two to three hours on a cancer patient, Hsiao said.</p>
<p>The former chemistry Ph.D. from the University of California Berkeley believes that startups have what it takes to fight cancer with T cell therapy. “I think startups should be extremely effective at fighting and should always remember our goals and visions,” said Hsiao in a report, recalling the years when Acepodia itself was just starting.</p>
<p>Hsiao also received a chemical engineering degree at National Taiwan University. He co-founded Acepodia with Matthew Francis, a professor of chemistry and executive associate dean in the college of chemistry at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>The company staff has doubled to 12 people since its founding and set up R&amp;D teams in California as well as Taipei.</p>
<p>The company has joined researchers for animal testing and evaluation at hospital labs, including those at Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley, said Hsiao.</p>
<p>He added that the company is looking forward to using the staff and laboratories of Taiwanese hospitals to advance his therapy among local medical practitioners.</p>
<p>Acepodia faces competition from established players such as cancer-drug maker Gilead Sciences and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, a California-based cancer-immunotherapy biotech.</p>
<p>Hsiao’s firm raised more than US$33 million in series A funding from several Silicon Valley-based venture capitalists in 2015. Part of the funds will be used to prepare ACE-T for the clinical trials.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the company also received a US$350,000 National Cancer Institute grant for cancer research, Acepodia’s website says.</p>

A growing section of the master 2018 Computex Taipei event called InnoVEX will play up cross-border business-to-business links and help startups get access to venture capital.</p>
<p>Behind all of it, exhibitors will focus largely on designs that use artificial Intelligence, a new trend in high-tech that means teaching computers to think like people.</p>
<p>Organizers of Computex 2018 held a news conference May 15 to preview InnoVEX.</p>
<p>InnoVEX will draw 388 startups from 21 countries, said Walter Yeh, president of event organizer the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, or TAITRA. He expects InnoVEX to let Taiwan’s startups form ties with peers in other countries.</p>
<p>The number of country pavilions will grow this year to 13.</p>
<p>Several European country pavilions will host pitch competitions to give their talent a platform to showcase their products to investors at the event in the hope of finding more funds.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Business France , which promotes French companies and helps them find commercial partners abroad, says its pavilion will hold 90-minute a pitch session June 6.</p>
<p>Its delegation’s startups, which are visiting from France, will present proposals to a live audience. Though the session is not a competition, organizers say the exposure it brings should enable the French startups to find extra capital from investors.</p>
<p>“It is the perfect way to learn more about the French startup ecosystem and what possible opportunities are available,” the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office in Taiwan will hold matchmaking sessions and happy hours at their pavilion June 6.</p>
<p>Sixteen star startups from the Netherlands will attend, each picked for its compatibility with the Taiwanese tech industry. One firm is Lightyear, the developer of an electric car charged by solar energy via receptors built into the vehicle.</p>
<p>The Dutch government counts Computex as its only strategic expo in Asia, said Diederik van der Toorn, a consultant for trade and investment office.</p>
<p>Audi Taiwan will announce the winner of an award on June 7, a company official told the news conference. The Audi Innovation Award, including sums of money, will go to Taiwanese startups with products or services related to mobility.</p>
<h2>Startups meet investors</h2>
<p>To help pair startups with investors, InnoVEX will feature Pi Stage, a physical exhibition platform for startup founders and other companies. Venture capital investors will get extra exposure at this year’s event, which will also help participants make connections among themselves, which may include partnerships for product development, Yeh said.</p>
<p>On the venture capital side, Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, well-known for investing heavily in young startups, attending Innovex for the first times this year.</p>
<p>Lee Ru-yuan of Garage+, a Taipei-based incubator founded by Epoch Fund, said the organization had selected 76 startups from a total of 591 applicants for its Global Startup Program. As part of a 10-day tour of Taiwan, the startups will meet one-on-one with key industry players at Computex and make site visits to find supply chain partners.</p>
<p>One-third of the Garage+ participating startups found business deals and investors at the 2017 event, a ratio it aims to sustain or exceed this year. “If you are aware of your strengths, you don’t need to worry about the world not noticing you,” Lee said.</p>
<h2>Artificial intelligence on display</h2>
<p>About a third of overseas startups at InnoVEX this year work with artificial intelligence, or AI, Yeh said. He said the event organizers had pushed to increase this count.</p>
<p>One will be U.K.-based data analytics and AI-internet of things firm NQM.AI. The Canadian startup Invision AI will attend, too, to show real-time video analytics for IP cameras.</p>
<p>“InnoVEX is the most important platform Taiwan has for connecting its startups with the outside world,” Yeh said.</p>

Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand All Say Here', '2018-05-17', 'news', '<p>Young entrepreneurs looking to enter Asia can choose from a list of welcoming countries. Leaders based in four of those markets made their cases in April.</p>
<p>Startup scene veterans from Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan showed April 18 at the Taipei event “Battle of the Ecosystems” to speak for their home markets – as well as caution founders about potential obstacles.</p>
<p>The venue for the event held by <a title="https://www.startupstadium.tw/overview" href="https://www.startupstadium.tw/overview">Taiwan Startup Stadium</a>, a government-backed organization that coaches Taiwanese startups, left standing room only as young entrepreneurs packed in to get insights on how each startup ecosystem works.</p>
<h2>Japan in market of its own</h2>
<p>Japan offers startups a solid regulatory environment, technically skilled workers and a laboratory for blockchain-based technology, said <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42773" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42773">Joseph Huang, a venture partner with Japan-based Infinity Ventures.</a></p>
<p>With offices in Tokyo, Beijing and Taipei, Infinity Ventures is an investment fund that helps internet startups focused on Asian markets.</p>
<p>In Japan, however, business people must get used to ambiguous maybes and other indirect communication, Huang said. Business development can be slow, too, especially when it comes to getting go-aheads from partners, he cautioned.</p>
<p>A contract in Japan can take six to 12 months for completion, he added, but Japanese partners are “extremely efficient” once they’re on board.</p>
<p>Despite Japan’s reputation for inventing new technology, the country’s consumers are typically late adopters of new trends, Huang said. Yet when consumers back a new trend, he said, it can really take off. The domestic market is big enough that startups based there need not expand abroad.</p>
<p>“I think this time lag means foreigners are well placed to introduce new products and services to the Japanese market, if they can get the timing right,” he said.</p>
<p>Huang cautioned that Japanese language ability is required as no entrepreneurs will thrive there without it.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.infinityventures.com" href="http://www.infinityventures.com/">Infinity Ventures</a>, founded in 2009, looks mainly for content marketing startups. Candidates for funding also work with digital imaging, gaming and entertainment.</p>
<h2>Thailand: Practice positive energy</h2>
<p>Amarit Charoenphan, co-founder of Techsauce Media, a tech and business news outlet, and HUBBA, one of Thailand’s biggest co-working spaces, called the Southeast Asian country a “fun gateway” to burgeoning Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Thailand attracts startups largely for marketing and ecommerce.</p>
<p>Charoenphan talked up Thailand’s those sectors and its draw for design companies. But the ambiguities common in Japan occur in Thailand, too, the co-founder said. A yes can even mean no, he said.</p>
<p>It’s important to exchange “positive energy” between partners and investors and build trust, Charoenphan said.</p>
<p>Charoenphan described Southeast Asia’s affordability and lifestyle as perfect for young entrepreneurs who need to keep burn rates low. Funding is available from the corporate venture capital sector in Thailand when startups want to expand.</p>
<p>“While regulation in Thailand can be clunky,” Charoenphan said, “there is a willingness to make things smoother.”</p>
<h2>Hong Kong as a link to China and a lot of other places</h2>
<p>Hong Kong may draw startups for its ease of doing business, links to other parts of the world and entryway into mainland China, said Alex Chan, co-director of startup accelerator The Mills Fabrica. This firm, also a venture capital fund, focuses on startups that try new fashion production methods, e-commerce and high-tech fabrics.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is otherwise known for business opportunities in financial technology and mini-storage.</p>
<p>“From day one, Hong Kong has always been a bridging market,” Chan said. The territory’s position as a regional hub gives companies there better reach to markets and funding, he added.</p>
<p>“Our strength comes from our connectivity across the region, so if we can recruit Taiwanese talent, it is to our benefit too,” said Chan, whose firm is based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Against competition from other parts of Asia, Hong Kong may be able to gain an edge by expanding its textile industry – a former growth driver that has waned in recent years due to the outsourcing of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Today the sector employees almost 3 percent of the total labor force in Hong Kong and represents roughly 2 percent of exports. Chang says expanding innovation in e-commerce, fabric research and new production and distribution models can give the local sector new life.</p>
<p>The Mills Fabrica looks for startups that try new fashion production methods, e-commerce and high-tech fabrics.</p>
<p>Asked to share an insider tip, Chan said Hong Kong investors prefer companies that set up as a British Virgin Islands offshore corporation as the jurisdiction has virtually no taxation.</p>
<h2>Taiwan &#8212; for entrepreneurs who want quality of life</h2>
<p>Government support is giving Taiwan a lift as a cradle for startups, said Holly Harrington, co-founder and general manager of the Taiwan Startup Stadium.</p>
<p>She talked up Taiwan’s tech-savvy talent and described what she calls quality of life. Many young Taiwanese have returned after years of working abroad, she said. But Taiwan-based startups must consider expanding offshore due to the markets small size, Harrington said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately Taiwan is a bridging ecosystem,” she says. “So we encourage our members in Startup Stadium to focus on expanding outward.”</p>
<p>Harrington points to a decrease in the number of startups active in China in recent years. More young firms are now looking toward the Japan, Southeast Asia and the United States, she said. Differences between the two sides in online platform usage and internet regulations explain the decrease, she said.</p>
<p>The little-known Taiwanese founders behind some of Silicon Valley’s biggest startups give young entrepreneurs still in Taiwan extra access to funding and mentoring, Harrington said. Many VC firms, accelerators and consultants from other parts of the world feel good about Taiwan, she added.</p>
<p>“When people hear you’re from Taiwan, they really want to help you,” she said.</p>
<p>Startups based in Taiwan may need to adjust to the local stratospheric use of Facebook, she said. Harrington coaches young local entrepreneurs heading abroad to diversify their own social media usage.</p>
<p>Taiwan is seen as an ideal spot for internet-of-things startups.</p>
<p>She also warns newcomers that Taiwanese may be late with e-mail replies and ignore missed phone calls. Taiwan’s process for getting entrepreneur visas could be improved, she said.</p>
<p>“Once people discover the potential here, they keep coming back for more,” Harrington said.</p>

<p>“The idea is to create AI-powered applications that will help our clients improve customer service,” company CEO and Chairman Hui Hsiung told a conference in Taipei last month. “The applications will be able to provide customers with efficient, personalized responses in the digital world.”</p>
<p>Hsiung spoke at Future Commerce 2018, a three-day annual event organized by Business Next/Manager Today. The 2018 event took place April 26-28 in Taipei and featured 20 speakers.</p>
<p>Hsiung, 65, a former AU Optronics Corp. executive vice president who served a three-year prison term in the United States over an LCD price fixing case in 2012, spoke to a crowd of Taiwanese company executives, founders, investors and other industry specialists.</p>
<p>The company will train its chatbots for business clients in specific fields, Hsiung said. It is working now on algorithms to let chatbots assist office managers, product managers and administrative staffs. D8AI will develop automated text-based virtual assistants, for example, to schedule meetings and travel.</p>
<p>Hsiung gave few details in his speech about the role of artificial intelligence, saying that process is still being developed.</p>
<h2>Founders both studied at the University of California, Berkeley</h2>
<p>Hsiung founded D8AI in April 2017 with Richard Sheng, a University of California, Berkeley-educated computer scientist.</p>
<p>“We wanted to explore the realm of AI applications,” Hsiung said. “We didn’t want to miss our opportunity to ride the AI wave.”</p>
<p>Hsiung received a Ph.D. degree in physics from the same university. His was executive vice president of AU Optronics Corp. and a former CEO of Qisda Corp., both publicly traded high tech hardware companies in Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to D8AI’s website, the company name derives from a longer term, Dimension-8 Artificial Intelligence. It set out to make customized software or software-hardware combinations for enterprises and other institutions work with their customers or employees.</p>
<h2>Talent search</h2>
<p>Pairing artificial intelligence, or AI, with startups will require more talent to come on board, Hsiung said.</p>
<p>“I believe that Taiwan has AI talents,” Hsiung said. “We have cultivated many top engineering talents over the years. But many of them have joined big companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.</p>
<p>“I’d like to take this opportunity to encourage our Taiwanese young people to challenge yourself and try getting into AI,” he said.</p>
<h2>E-commerce model</h2>
<p>AI-powered chatbots now help e-commerce retailers and product managers. Today some of them greet customers in online stores, clarify customer needs and react to customer responses.</p>
<p>In e-commerce now, chatbots sometimes serve as a final stroke of communication after an ecommerce transaction, according to this industry online magazine report.</p>
<p>Chatbots can eventually help businesses automate sales and customer support services, in turn cutting labor costs, Hsiung said.</p>

<p>Today, after announcing it during the Las Vegas CES last January, Valérie Pécresse, the President of Paris Region, launched the one-million-euro competition “AI Challenge Paris Region 2018”, the first international challenge dedicated to startups, in the presence of Alexandra Dublanche, vice-president in charge of economic development at the Paris Region, Christophe Gégout, deputy managing director of the Alternative  nergies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), Jérôme Snollaerts, CEO of CapDecisif Management and administrator of the Paris Region Venture Fund, and all the project partners : Dassault Systèmes, Atos, EY and Empruntis.</p>
<p>This outstanding competition is intended both for Paris Region companies and all the startups wanting to take root in the Paris Region. Unprecedented in its endowment, it is in keeping with the Region’s new attractiveness strategy in support of Artificial Intelligence, and illustrates the global ambition of the Paris Region ecosystem in the sector, notably in the fields of mobility and 4.0 industries (infrastructures, applications, platforms).</p>
<p>This defining event for the startup ecosystem participates in an overall strategy to turn Ile-de-France into a “Startup Region”, and more specifically to make it the European capital of Artifical Intelligence. It supplements the very strong involvement of Paris Region in the Digihall project, which deals with the creation of an international pole of reference for digital technology and artificial intelligence at Paris-Saclay, or in the evelopment of the Atos Quantum Computing R&amp;D laboratory in Clayes-sous-Bois.</p>
<p>The competition is aimed at the startups being able to display a product (software or hardware) that is at the minimum in the pilot phase, or, ideally, that was already deployed at some clients’. The product should be the result of a recent innovation using Artificial Intelligence, and have potential industrial applications. The company should be less than five years old, plan to raise funds within 24 months, and have risen less than €500,000.</p>
<p>For the Region, the “AI Challenge Paris Region 2018” has three objectives:</p>
<p>&#8211; Position Ile-de-France on the world stage as a key territory in the field of AI, in order to show that the Region is open to international cooperation in the sector, and that it meets all the necessary requirements to achieve it.</p>
<p>&#8211; Develop and capitalize on a top-tier innovative regional ecosystem in terms of AI.</p>
<p>&#8211; Take part in the acceleration of the Ile-de-France economical players’ digital transition, notably in the industry.</p>
<p>The one-million-euro endowment (€700,000 for the winner, and €150,000 for the 2nd and 3rd), granted in the form of a capital injection, will enable the Region to support the strategic and commercial development of 3 emerging players of AI in Ile-de-France, in the long run, through the “Paris Region Venture Fund” and the “Investment” branch of the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>Applications should be submitted on the dedicated online platform “aichallenge.parisregion.eu” as of April 12th, and before June 17th.</p>
<p>At the end of the application process, a jury of 15 partners and scientists presided by Bertrand Braunschweig, Director of the INRIA Paris-Saclay, will determine the 10 first winners on July 3rd, 2018.</p>
<p>These 10 companies shall benefit from a very intensive support during three months. The first two recipients are to be more specifically coached by Ernst &amp; Young. The industrial sponsors of the event (Dassault Systèmes, Atos, Empruntis) will step in subsequently in order to provide expert advice to the applicants on very precise problems, notably on the technical aspects of their products. Foreign applicants will also receive advice on implementation issues from Paris Region Entreprises, the enforcer of the Paris Region attractiveness policy.</p>
<p>The third month of coaching will be an opportunity for the applicants to solicit, on their own initiative, the partners, mentors, and experts involved in the Challenge on issues they judge are strategic for the output of their product and the development of their company (technical expertise, recruitment, market&#8230;).</p>
<p>On top of the criteria taken into account for the selection of the 10 companies (business model, relevance in relation to the AI thematic, social progress brought about by the designed product…), the final laureates will also be rated for the progress they achieved over the mentoring period.</p>
<p>The names of the 3 final recipients will be disclosed during the regional conference on AI, early October, a federative event for Paris Region AI and its international outreach, under the co-presidency of Bertrand Braunschweig.</p>
<p>Valérie Pécresse declared: “As the leading Smart Region in Europe, rich with 1,300 research laboratories, 162,000 researchers, and close to 8,000 startups, we are proud to launch this competition in an environment conducive to innovation and Artificial Intelligence. It will allow us to speed up the development of the fledgling AI businesses in Ile-de-France, and to transform them into the champions of tomorrow’s digital world.”</p>

<p>Fast-tracking tie-ups with like-minded countries while transforming Taiwan’s economic and industrial structures is one of the main functions of the policy, Lai said. Another is its important role in balancing the nation’s global strategy and ensuring sustainable long-term development, he added.</p>
<p>According to Lai, no stone will be left unturned in cultivating collaborations and partnerships with NSP target countries based on the principles of reciprocity, diversity and win-win outcomes.</p>
<p>A key plank in the government’s national development strategy, the policy seeks to deepen agricultural, business, cultural, education, tourism and trade ties with the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nation member states, six South Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The latest statistics from the Cabinet’s Office of Trade Negotiations illustrate the effectiveness of the policy to date. Total trade with NSP target countries climbed 15.61 percent year on year to US$110.9 billion in 2017; Taiwan investment in the region surged 54.51 percent to US$3.68 billion; and inbound investment moved up 15.8 percent to US$270 million.</p>
<p>On the education front, the number of students from NSP target countries enrolled in Taiwan institutions during the first semester of 2017 increased 18 percent to 37,999. A similar rise of 19.7 percent to 19,269 was recorded for locals studying in the region.</p>
<p>Tourism metrics also trended upwards. Arrivals from NSP countries climbed 27.65 percent to 2.28 million, while Taiwan departures to the region gained 10.77 percent to 2.47 million. The former is attributed to the easing of visa regulations for nationals from NSP target countries such as Brunei, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</p>
<p>Regarding business opportunities, one of the highlights involved Taiwan firms sealing deals totaling NT$25.2 billion (US$850.89 million) for 2017 across sectors like energy, environmental protection engineering, petrochemical and smart urban transportation.</p>
<p>This is largely due to tailored government support measures, renewed investment protection agreements with India and the Philippines and the establishment of Taiwan investment service windows in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

<p><a title="https://www.google.com/about/our-company/" href="https://www.google.com/about/our-company/">Google</a> has already made more than 100 jobs available, including positions in the research and development of artificial intelligence (AI) and expects to employ a total of more than 300 Taiwanese professionals this year.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley software giant’s March 21 announcement also calls for training talent this year, building on what it sees as Taiwan’s strength today – integrated circuit design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>It plans to work toward that goal with Taiwan government departments, universities and the business sector. It will train over 5,000 artificial intelligence (AI) talents and 50,000 digital marketing personnel over the coming year.</p>
<p>The company has also finished the third phase of an expansion of its Google Taiwan Data Center in Changbin Industrial Park in central Taiwan. It will roll out the fourth phase over the rest of 2018.</p>
<p>According to a report from consultancy Copenhagen Economics, in the seven years since Google first invested in the <a title="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/changhua-county/" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/changhua-county/">Google Taiwan Data Center</a> until now, its operations have spurred investments in servers, network solutions, renewable energy and other related industries. Those investments have contributed about NT17.6 billion (US$604 million) to the Taiwan economy.</p>
<p>“Despite Taiwan’s size, the possibilities here are endless… and the investment Google is making in Taiwan’s intelligent hardware isn’t restricted to smartphones alone,” said Chien Li-feng, Google Taiwan’s general manager at the launch.</p>
<p>In January Google paid HTC to bring on 2,000 of the Taiwanese tech hardware firm’s employees and help develop Pixel smartphones.</p>
<p>Following Google’s work in Taiwan to develop Android devices from Taiwan and Chromebook PCs, the company will expand its collaboration with its Taiwanese equipment contactors to develop vehicles, wearable devices, television sets and home appliances, Chien added.</p>
<h2>Boom in artificial intelligence</h2>
<p>Taiwan is becoming Google’s strategic base for AI hardware development.</p>
<p>The 300 people being recruited for jobs in areas such as artificial intelligence will help Google Home, an interactive speaker, its Cloud services and consumer hardware.</p>
<p>If Google wants to expand long term in Taiwan, the location needs not only a large scale of hardware, but also a foundation in software plus talents with core competence in artificial intelligence. That backdrop explains Google’s push for AI-related training courses in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The training would support Google to expand fundamental AI knowhow, leading to higher adoption rates of its customizable machine learning service, the open-source dataflow programming library TensorFlow and other Google cloud-based tools.</p>
<p>Training would help Taiwan’s universities and AI hardware manufacturers nurture AI talent on a larger scale, as well.</p>
<p>Google will hold an “AI Innovation Research Camp” with academics at National Taiwan University, Ching Hua University, Chiao Tung University and Cheng-kung University. The camp would give academics more opportunities to deepen exchange with Google’s own AI experts and become better connected with the industry on an international level.</p>
<p>Another training session, Google’s “Machine Learning Crash Course” will be free for university professors, high school teachers and company training managers. The idea is to spread AI education.</p>
<p>“This learning material is not only made up of online courses, but also includes practical offline events,” Chien said.</p>

<p>The firm will look for researchers and engineers as well as people who are skilled in human resources and law.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to open some of the Taiwan AI jobs to applicants overseas, and people hired in Taiwan would get opportunities to work abroad for the company.</p>
<p>“One of our goals is also to cultivate talents locally in Taiwan,” said David Ku, chief technology officer of Microsoft’s AI and Research Group. “We hope that through the establishment of this center, Taiwanese talents will have more opportunities to interact and learn from top talents around the world.”</p>
<p>Recruiters will visit National Taiwan University, National Cheng Kung University, National Tsing Hua University, National Chiao Tung University and National Central University.</p>
<p>The AI R&amp;D Center is just Microsoft’s latest project in Taiwan. In December it formed a partnership with the government’s <a title="http://www.narlabs.org.tw/en/" href="http://www.narlabs.org.tw/en/">National Applied Research Laboratories</a> to offer its AI development platform; and in September the company launched its AI Talent Cultivation Project with the Taipei Medical University.</p>
<h2>AI research focused on engineering</h2>
<p>The Microsoft AI R&amp;D Center in Taiwan will not pursue the basic science of artificial intelligence, which means teaching machines to interpret and anticipate a user’s movements. Instead, the center is designed to be more engineering-centric.</p>
<p>Its research will focus on Microsoft’s <a title="https://swiftkey.com/en" href="https://swiftkey.com/en">“SwiftKey”</a> mobile typing input system for the Chinese language, a technology called “Audience Intent Recognition” and vertical applications for certain industries in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to make AI technologies available to other companies in Taiwan. By working with those firms, Microsoft expects to understand what they need from AI and help them use the emerging technology to improve business.</p>
<p>A manufacturer, for example, could use image recognition technology installed drones to do pipeline inspections, saving labor costs and getting real-time information.</p>
<p>Image recognition technology can also be used in product inspection to raise accuracy and efficiency. In the manufacturing process, humans normally make final inspections. Computers would take over the job with image recognition technology and AI.</p>

<p>Lawmaker Jason Hsu says is trying to push Taiwan toward liberalization to stoke the economy as Japan and Singapore do now. To get there, he says, the island government should pass a bill, issue guidelines or write a “playbook” on what’s legal, so businesses know what to do.</p>
<p>“It’s still a wait-and-see approach,” Hsu told Business Next in an interview Tuesday. “The answers I got from the executive branch are a somewhat lenient approach, ‘I don’t encourage, but I don’t discourage.’ It’s kind of like a holding pattern.”</p>
<p>Hsu said he has talked to Taiwan’s central bank and Financial Supervisory Commission, the two agencies that would formulate a crypto-policy, about learning from Asian peers such as Singapore and Japan.</p>
<p>The minority Nationalist Party lawmaker is talking as well to peers in the majority Democratic Progressive Party caucus about some kind of legislation. Legislators have had several debates to date, he said, but they’re awaiting direction from the government before making any decisions.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to freely traded digital tokens backed by a public transaction ledger, all outside a country’s formal monetary system. It can be used to buy and sell or to save as a financial asset like stocks or other currencies.</p>
<p>Two Taiwan-based platforms and <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/84475">an estimated 25,000 local users</a> trade cryptocurrency as some major banks develop their own schemes. Fintech startups such as a Taiwanese <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42516">“cold wallet” firm</a> are becoming more visible, as well.</p>
<p>Taiwan needs cryptocurrency to stoke fintech, healthcare and developments in high tech, the lawmaker said.</p>
<p>On March 23 parliament was scheduled to ask questions of Taiwan Premier William Lai about the government’s ambitions for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission takes a “neutral” approach to cryptocurrency trade, a commission media liaison said this week. But the commission warned of “risks” in a statement on December 19 following price fluctuations in the crypto market.</p>
<p>Officials worry now about cryptocurrency taxation and prevention of money laundering, Hsu said. Traditional banks that stand to lose business may also be pressuring government to shun liberalization, he said.</p>
<p>China is prepping to tighten regulations that ban fundraisers called initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges, the state-run newspaper China Daily online said in February.</p>
<p>Japan, by contrast, declared in April 2017 Bitcoin legal tender as part of efforts to become a major cryptocurrency trading center. Japan’s trade comes to <a title="http://www.cryptoanalyst.co/2017/10/13/japan-worlds-largest-bitcoin-trading/" href="http://www.cryptoanalyst.co/2017/10/13/japan-worlds-largest-bitcoin-trading/">58% of the global volume.</a></p>
<p>“China banned it, so we could say ‘hey look we should do it,’” Hsu said.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/investments/consumer-alerts/virtual-currencies.aspx" href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/investments/consumer-alerts/virtual-currencies.aspx">Singapore</a> allows free trade in cryptocurrency and regulates cryptocurrency exchanges in case of laundering or funding for terrorists.</p>
<p>Taiwan probably lacks “momentum” to pass a cryptocurrency regulation at least in the first half of the year, Hsu says, but he believes guidelines are already in the works. People are already trading it, he notes.</p>
<p>“It’s not so hard to regulate this,” he said. “You look at what Singapore is doing. Younger people want it and if our government fails to understand this, it’s a pity.”</p>

<p>The premier characterized Taiwan as a small but successful country that must become more proactive and flexible in order to remain competitive internationally. To do this, the many outdated laws, regulations and interpretations implemented over the past few decades must be relaxed to allow Taiwan to reap even greater rewards in the international sphere.</p>
<p>To retain excellent talent and deepen a culture of good corporate governance among local firms, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) was instructed by the premier to move quickly forward with revising the Securities and Exchange Act. In particular, amendments to extend the amount of time that companies can hold treasury shares for later distribution to employees should be drafted and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and debate as quickly as possible. A new blueprint for corporate governance should also be promoted. To encourage domestic and international firms to list on Taiwan’s stock exchanges, the FSC should take the initiative to organize relevant ministries and agencies to develop feasible measures that will increase momentum in the financial markets.</p>
<p>Financial markets play an important role in supporting industrial development, said Premier Lai, as well as serve as a window onto the broader economy. Healthy financial markets are a win for corporations, the government and investors alike.</p>
<p>With respect to a plan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to establish a stand-alone unit to promote investment in Taiwan by courting international firms and recruiting global talent, Premier Lai urged quick action, saying that this office would be a core component of such efforts. On the domestic front, in consideration of the nation’s overall development and industrial policies, accompanying strategies to draw foreign companies to Taiwan and retain professional talent should be developed. On the international front, a network among foreign chambers of commerce, domestic industry groups, overseas representative offices, central agencies and local governments should be built to improve overall efficiency. The premier instructed the MOEA to come up with a ready-to-go schedule and concrete mechanisms for operations within two weeks.</p>', '5e1/012/018/5e101201877fc584706689.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>Organized by the Ministry of Culture and Taiwan Design Center, the five-day event is taking place at Huashan 1914 Creative Park, Songshan Cultural and Creative Park, and Taipei Expo Park. In addition to the latest products by exhibitors from home and abroad, the expo features bazaars, exhibitions and film screenings bringing visitors up to speed on Taiwan’s unique brand of design.</p>
<p>A special aspect of this year’s event is the 10 themed tours highlighting Taiwan’s aesthetics, cultural diversity and creativity. Spanning crafts, fashion, film, food, music, nature, outdoor workouts and social activities, the tours will introduce 77 stores and unique spots.</p>
<p>In addition, 13 of Taiwan’s cities and counties are curating custom tours encompassing 146 cultural destinations as part of efforts promoting the expo, cultural tourism and local businesses.</p>
<p>MOC Vice Minister Lee Lien-chuan said starting last year, the ministry began selecting themes for the expo with a view to strengthening the cultural content of the event. This was accomplished by interpreting diverse views of different eras and cultures, as well as stimulating creativity and innovation, he added.</p>
<p>According to the MOC, these efforts paid quick dividends with the Cultural Explosion-themed pavilion for the 2017 event named one of the Best 100 by Japan’s Good Design Award. This was on the strength of its content curating and spatial and visual designs for displaying cultural and creative merchandise in a nontraditional manner.</p>

<p>It is expected that the Body Knowledge theme of this year’s expo will prove equally successful, according to the MOC. The concept seeks to explore senses of the human body and how proprioception influences humanity’s comprehension and interpretation of aesthetics, culture and originality.</p>
<p>Inaugurated in 2010, the annual Creative Expo Taiwan plays a key role in the strategic promotion of the cultural and creative industry by the MOC.

The company obtained first fair-trade certification of its kind in greater China. In February this year she announced the launch a chatbot on her official Facebook fan page.</p>
<p>Time in business and in parliament has given <a title="https://www.facebook.com/Yuwanju/" href="https://www.facebook.com/Yuwanju/">Yu</a> a keen sense of what she wants to do for domestic startups, which she calls diverse and potentially powerful in numbers. She shared views about law and business in an interview with Business Next.</p>
<h2>Legal changes for startups</h2>
<p>Now Taiwan’s startups need more government support as they chase business in foreign markets, Yu said. Taiwan Premier William Lai already backs the effort, she believes. Yu is using parliament to persuade the cause, with two related laws to date.</p>
<p>The pair of laws advance startups as well as Taiwan itself. One bill, <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/41840" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/41840">the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals</a>, was designed to attract more foreign professionals to Taiwan for work, in turn boosting the economy.</p>
<p>“Actually the announcement of Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals generated a huge echo,” Yu said. “Many overseas startups noticed this act and are eager to know more.”</p>
<p>Yu pushed for passage of the act in view of Taiwan’s low birth rate and the trend of university graduates seeking work overseas. Yu became the legislature’s advocate of this bill.</p>
<p>The lawmaker also authored Taiwan’s <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42413" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42413">Act on Financial Technology Innovation and Experiments</a>, which gives pioneering legal protections to fintech startups. Specifically, small experimental firms will be able to compete against well-knwon and big banks with little risk of violating normal laws including those covering intellectual property.</p>
<p>Parliament finalized the fintech law in December. Both acts backed by Yu take effect this year.</p>
<h2>One startup’s case</h2>
<p>Yu’s Facebook chatbot has brought in the artificial intelligence firm <a title="https://www.sinitic.ai" href="https://www.sinitic.ai/">Sinitic</a>.</p>
<p>The Sinitic CEO, a Canadian entrepreneur, had applied for an entrepreneur visa to establish the startup in Taiwan, Yu said. The foreign professionals act has obvious benefit, she added.</p>
<p>Sinitic’s staff one day asked Yu’s office whether they needed artificial intelligence to create the chatbot and reach tens of thousands of messages from the public. The chatbot helps the public contact her office to discuss issues.</p>
<p>Going forward, Yu will use her legislative seat to help women break glass ceilings at work. Some ceilings have been broken, Yu said, but it’s important to keep an eye on the broader issue.</p>

This approach is central to SMEs becoming more competitive through the adoption of smart technology applications and pursuit of innovation, he added.</p>
<p>To this end, the premier directed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to continue providing multilevel guidance and present an action plan within one month. No time can be wasted in devising ways of effectively assisting in the transformation and upgrade of SMEs, he said.</p>
<p>Lai made the remarks during a March 15 interagency meeting on accelerating investment. In addition to presentations on issues pertaining to SMEs, which comprise nearly 98 percent of businesses in Taiwan, participants were brought up to speed on progress relating to railway construction and maintenance key performance indicators as well as deregulation.</p>
<p>Regarding railway KPIs, the premier said 38 specific plans are targeted for promotion under the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program. Even as the government vigorously encourages railway construction, consideration is also given to matters like boosting domestic technological capabilities for operating networks, as well as developing the rail industry as a whole, he added.</p>
<p>Running from September 2017 to August 2021, the NT$420 billion (US$14.4 billion) FIDP aims to meet Taiwan’s development needs for the next 30 years. It comprises eight categories: aquatic environments to build resilience against climate change, child care facilities to address declining birthrates, digitalization to create a connected nation, food safety to protect consumers’ health, green energy to ensure environmental sustainability, human resources to boost employment, railway development to provide convenient and safe transportation and urban-rural projects to balance regional development.</p>
<p>According to Lai, keeping Taiwan’s rail industry moving forward is of paramount importance. The MOEA, Ministry of Transportation and Communications and Public Construction Commission will help achieve this goal by drafting policies covering the establishment of standards for related products, supply and demand, and promoting the broader participation of local firms in railway project tenders, he said.</p>
<p>On the deregulation front, the premier said all reviews and reforms must be carried out with a view to boosting economic activity and meeting the needs of businesses and the public. Where appropriate, the regulatory framework should be relaxed to optimize the overall investment environment in Taiwan, he added.</p>

<p>“One of the main reasons is you have a super high intensity of all the ingredients to be successful as a founder,” he said. “There are hundreds, if not thousands, of serial founders who act as mentors, early-stage investors, and there are hundreds and hundreds of venture sources for money.”</p>
<p>About 80% of his audience came from tech startups, investment firms and other IT companies. Bernard Chan, founder of the Singaporean school for startups ALPHA Camp, moderated the discussion.</p>
<p>Tech hotspots in other countries should also draw startup founders as they look for ways to raise funds and expand international markets, Desmond said. He named China, Israel, Berlin, London, Paris and Stockholm in particular.</p>
<p>For instance, he said: “if you’re in security (software), you might not want to go to Silicon Valley but Tel Aviv, because a lot of investors who understand it are there.</p>
<p>“What’s changing is not that Silicon Valley is getting weaker, it’s just that a lot of places around the globe are getting very strong,” Desmond said.</p>

<p>Desmond is also currently general manager of <a title="https://www.aol.com/video/channel/tech/" href="https://www.aol.com/video/channel/tech/">AOL Tech</a> and tech news media website <a title="https://www.engadget.com/uk/" href="https://www.engadget.com/uk/">Engadget.</a></p>
<p>He was responsible for 11-year-old tech-company database CrunchBase from April 2012 to September 2015, when it spun off from AOL/Verizon as a standalone company. That role sparked discussion at the panel event.</p>
<p>Desmond and colleagues turned CrunchBase’s former parent company TechCrunch into a source of news on tech startups after he reached the Silicon Valley in 1996. He had worked before as an Asia correspondent for <a title="http://time.com" href="http://time.com/">Time magazine.</a></p>
<p>Asked at the event why relatively few Taiwanese startup list on CrunchBase, Desmond said that “perhaps it is evidence that critics say that the startup scene in Taiwan doesn&#8217;t think globally enough.”</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 Taiwanese startups are listed now on CrunchBase compared to Singapore’s 11,639 registered startups and Hong Kong’s 7,806. No fee is required for startup companies to be registered on CrunchBase.</p>
<p>Desmond added that he often gets questions such as, “Why should we waste our time putting our data on CrunchBase?” and “Everybody in my neighborhood knows who I am, and all the investors (who) I know know who I am, so what&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>“The point is if you want to be seen by the global startups, if you want venture partners and investors around the world to know who you are, you have to be on CrunchBase,” he said.</p>
<p>The speaker cautioned separately against funding for startups that do initial coin offerings (ICO), part of the crypto-currency phenomenon.</p>
<p>“My personal opinion is that the ICO world has become very polluted. There are good ICOs, probably, but there&#8217;s awful lot of bad activity,” he said. “So people are becoming more careful about how to get involved in ICOs.</p>
<p>“I think the crypto-apocalypse for TechCrunch would be that founders don&#8217;t want to get together with anybody anymore because they just raise money through ICOs,” Desmond added. “So you don&#8217;t have to meet investors. They stay working at their desk, publish their white paper, put up their website, sell their coins, raise a hundred and million dollars, and the inventors just disappear.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch Disrupt is going to take place in Berlin and San Francisco this year, Desmond added in his remarks to the panel. The TechCrunch Disrupt team of 55 people organizes shows to give founders and investors a more efficient, productive way to find each other.</p>
<p>“We will undoubtedly do an event in the future in Taipei. We also want to do a Disrupt outside of the States just in a handful of cities that have huge markets. For us, San Francisco is obviously a huge market,” he said.</p>
<p>Fellow Business Next Meet panelist Holly Harrington, general manager of <a title="https://www.startupstadium.tw" href="https://www.startupstadium.tw/">Taiwan Startup Stadium</a>, echoed some of Desmond’s advice for Taiwan startups. She runs a Taipei-based, government-funded incubator that aims to train Taiwanese startups for expansion overseas.</p>
<p>The stadium has taken Taiwanese startups to San Francisco and New York for TechCrunch&#8217;s Disrupt events in the past years.</p>
<p>Harrington suggested that Taiwanese founders look for other options as places to seek funds and expand markets such as the U.S. cities of Austin, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Founders will have a better chance to leverage resources in these cities as they emerge as innovation hubs in the United States, she said.</p>
<p>“TSS started to spend a lot of time encouraging startups to explore other places in the U.S. because local governments all over the U.S. are putting more money into attracting startups,” Harrington said. “So if you want to go to Austin, Chicago, or Washington DC, it’s a little bit less competitive (compare to Silicon Valley).</p>
<p>“Taiwanese startups (in Taiwan) are like a big fish in a small pond, so going to big cities in the U.S. helps them learn how to compete,” she said. “Silicon Valley is a good place to get a more realistic starting point for Taiwanese startups.”</p>
<p>Foreign customers may not easily trust a brand when they can get similar products in their home countries, she said, so smaller Taiwanese companies must work harder to convince international markets that their brands top the competition.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s advantages in computer hardware manufacturing should not be ignored, said Ryan Kuo, president of <a title="http://www.cdibcapitalgroup.com/cdibenhtml/expertiseprint/1738" href="http://www.cdibcapitalgroup.com/cdibenhtml/expertiseprint/1738">CDIB Capital Innovation Accelerator</a> in Taipei. Local startup founders have the knowhow and capacity to build products that integrate software and hardware, he added.</p>
<p>Taiwanese startups have a chance now to build on internet of things because of Taiwan’s strengths in ICT hardware, Kuo said. His accelerator gives startups ways to capitalize on the IoT trend and reach foreign markets, he added.</p>

<p><a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/39562" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/39562">AI programming</a> differs from other code as it seeks to make the most of what it can learn from human users of devices where it is installed. Computers are supposed to make automated decisions via a neural network patterned upon the human brain.</p>
<p>The newness of AI has created many upstarts striving to become an industry standard. Nearly a dozen such deep learning frameworks exist, many of which are backed by rival tech giants.</p>
<p>Open Neural Network Exchange, or ONNX, was launched in 2017 to allow different deep learning frameworks to become compatible and interchangeable. By introducing common standards, AI developers can reduce complexity of the development process, speeding up commercialization.</p>
<p>Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft back ONNX. Intel, Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA, ARM and Huawei had begun using it at the start of the year, as well.</p>
<p>But Google has yet to back it, preferring instead a rival called TensorFlow. Its pick leaves the AI field fragmented and forces adopters to choose sides.</p>
<h2>Mediatek picks AI standard backed by Amazon, Microsoft</h2>
<p><a title="https://www.mediatek.tw" href="https://www.mediatek.tw/">MediaTek</a> announced February 22 that it would support ONNX.</p>

<p>MediaTek’s pursuit of AI includes new chipset designs for operations that typically require cell phones and higher-end cameras that connect to the cloud to handle AI functions such as voice recognition.</p>

<p>Benoit Guidee, director of <a title="https://www.france-taipei.org" href="https://www.france-taipei.org/">French Office in Taipei</a>, has pressed over the past three years for more tech ties between the two sides.</p>
<p>Guidee and Laurent Le Guyader, coordinator of <a title="https://taiwan.lafrenchtech.com" href="https://taiwan.lafrenchtech.com/">French Tech Taiwan</a>, spoke to Business Next February 27 about the French Office’s plans for 2018.</p>
<p>The French Office christened <a title="http://www.lafrenchtech.com" href="http://www.lafrenchtech.com/">La French Tech</a>, a 5-year-old branding program for French startups. The office joined Business Next to launch French Tech Taiwan. The newer program, the 23rd of its hub worldwide for France, combines the resources and ideas of French and Taiwanese entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“There were few French startups in Taiwan three years ago, but now we witness a bright present and future between the two sides,” Guidee said. “Now there are at least 50 startups founded by French entrepreneurs.”</p>
<p><a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/40001" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/40001">Christophe Fourtet, Sigfox’s co-founder</a> , came to Taiwan last year to discuss potential cooperation with Taiwanese companies on internet-of-things, for example.</p>

<h2>Plethora of programs for startups</h2>
<p>Taiwanese are also joining <a title="https://www.frenchtechticket.com" href="https://www.frenchtechticket.com/">French Tech Ticket</a>, a program supported by the French government to foster startups. It funds startup teams of two to three people including one French citizen. In turn they join one of 41 incubators in France.</p>
<p>And there’s one more option: the <a title="https://www.yeifrance.com" href="https://www.yeifrance.com/">Young Enterprise Initiative</a>, a decade-old program that received French government funding for Taipei last year. Three Taiwanese tech firms were picked for this program to spend a week in France.</p>
<p>“Creativity in different aspects is the key we need in France,” Guidee said in explaining the plethora of pro-startup programs.</p>

<p>Speaking at the same press conference National Development Council Minister Chen Mei-ling pledged that Taiwan would have its first unicorn in two years and another three in six years.</p>
<h2>How Taiwan will raise unicorns</h2>
<p>Lai’s cabinet has directed government ministries to implement an action plan that would improve the investment environment for Taiwanese startups.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, the month-old Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals will offer tax benefits, healthcare and retirement perks to skilled foreign workers.</p>
<p>Recruiting talented foreigners to work in Taiwan could help local startup expand into overseas markets where they otherwise may have little familiarity due to language or customs. Given Taiwan’s tiny market size, it’s highly likely that a unicorn would need to forage afield to support itself.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are drafting plans, modeled on Israel, for luring startups, startup accelerators, and venture capital firms to settle in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The economic affairs ministry has been charged with turning the Linkou artist village in suburban Taipei into a startup base as well as a demonstration ground for startup advancements in AI, IoT, and other new technologies.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Science and Technology will also be tasked with recruiting and training internationally competitive start-ups.</p>
<p>Taiwanese start-ups received 10 billion Taiwan dollars (US$341,000) in government funding last year. The National Development Council hopes to raise that amount by NT$5 billion annually over next five years.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s additional funding and lighter restrictions should position Taiwan not only as a fertile breeding ground for unicorns but also as a stronger center of innovation in Asia, Lai said.</p>

It’s a bold move made by the <a title="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/default.aspx" href="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/default.aspx">National Development Council</a> who in 2014 allocated 1 billion Taiwan dollars over five years to an &#8220;Angel Investor Program&#8221; that offers startups funding and mentoring.</p>

<h2>Will it work?</h2>
<p>The new moves will help but may not go far enough to make Taiwan a haven for start-ups, some observers say.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s more flexible attitude regarding government investment will lead to more investment and attract more start-up teams, Yvonne Chen, a partner the venture capital firm WI Harper said in a Business Next report on Feb.8, 2018.</p>
<p>Chen says the increase in funding is less important than changes to the review process.</p>
<p>Others believe more long-term support including education and training may be the key to creating more start-ups in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Weiwei Chiang, chairwoman of <a title="https://www.taiwantechmakers.com" href="https://www.taiwantechmakers.com/">Taiwan Techmakers Association</a>, says that more than a capital infusion in needed.

<p>The Netherlands’ <a title="https://www.startupdelta.org" href="https://www.startupdelta.org/">Startup Delta</a> has further advanced young Dutch companies, the adviser in Taipei said. Startup Delta gathers all layers from government’s support to main innovation hubs and corporations in order to foster Dutch startup ecosystem effective.</p>
<p>Education helps people in the Netherlands think creatively enough for help domestic startups develop stronger products, the adviser said.</p>
<p>“Students are encouraged to express what they think when they are at school even before they attend the universities,” van der Toorn said. “Dutch education spares more free time for students to do the things so that students can explore more about themselves.</p>
<p>“And during those times, students can develop their critical thinking, which is the key to help them achieve in their field in the future,” he said.</p>
<h2>Taiwan and the Netherlands</h2>
<p>Both Taiwan and the Netherlands have access to key markets as well as keenness to develop in high-tech, van der Toorn said.<br />
“The Netherlands is on a continent for access to the UK, France and Germany, while Taiwan is the gate to other important business destinations such as Japan, Korea and China,” he said.</p>
<p>Governments in both places support innovation that helps develop initiatives such as the O<a title="https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/travel-and-residence/visas-for-the-netherlands/orange-carpet-visa" href="https://www.netherlandsandyou.nl/travel-and-residence/visas-for-the-netherlands/orange-carpet-visa">range Carpet</a>, he said. This initiative is a preferential visa scheme in the Netherlands for business travelers. It’s designed to support entrepreneurs and startups.</p>
<p>Taiwan stands out for strength in manufacturing and related talent, van der Toorn says, so he wants to expand Taiwan’s cooperation with the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The trade office plans to invite at least 15 Dutch startups to join the InnoVEX trade show in Taipei this June.</p>
<p>The trade office has picked <a title="https://www.lightyear.one" href="https://www.lightyear.one/">Lightyear</a>, developer of solar-charged electric vehicles. Its cars are designed to run for months without being recharged.</p>
<p>Also selected: <a title="http://www.synano-cooling.com" href="http://www.synano-cooling.com/">Synano</a>, a Dutch startup that developed a cooling solution based on nanotechnology for electronic equipment that tends to run hot. This startup suits the Taiwanese electronics market with its focus on hardware, van der Toorn said.</p>

She picked Taiwan.</p>
<p>Lifshitz, CEO of her 3-year-old company <a title="https://www.noasmark.com" href="https://www.noasmark.com/">Noa’s Mark</a>, recalls a tip she got about a product development company in Taipei that was working with the other company in Tel Aviv where she’s based.</p>
<p>“Because of the contact with the product development center in Taipei, I knew about Taiwanese companies and had a few Taiwanese clients,” Lifshitz said.</p>
<p>Then she figured: Why not have a roadshow in Taipei? She quickly booked flights to Taipei and stayed a month. “I saw a great opportunity in Taiwan,” she said. Eventually she began to plant roots.</p>
<p>Then the hard part: Weathering culture shock and finding a viable business strategy that made unique sense for Taiwan’s legacy of hardware contracting.</p>
<p>“Taiwan has a good reputation in OEM and ODM (contract manufacturing), while the U.S. market cares more about the product’s value &#8212; how your product can affect the clients,” Lifshitz said.</p>
<p>Noa’s Mark helps tech firms form business plans, raise funds and enter markets. There’s also mentoring and keynote speeches. Some clients are in China, Singapore and the United States.</p>
<p>Now the CEO is focused on bringing Taiwan closer to Israel, auguring more cooperation that would be a boon for startups.</p>
<p>he consulting firm has teamed up with the city of Taipei’s business incubator <a title="https://www.startup.taipei/?lang=en" href="https://www.startup.taipei/?lang=en">Startup@ Taipei</a> and the <a title="http://www.narlabs.org.tw/en/" href="http://www.narlabs.org.tw/en/">National Applied Research Laboratories research center</a> under the central government to meet more Taiwanese startups. Lifshitz and her staff contacted more than 200 Taiwanese startups last year.</p>
<p>Coming from the startup nation-Israel, Noa has the spirit to share her experiences to those Taiwanese startups, no matter is to work with them or simply to be a mentor.</p>
<p>Many Taiwanese startup entrepreneurs lack family support, since their parents normally suggest getting stable jobs that promise a higher living standard, Lifshitz told Business Next. That means those younger people must choose either a stable lifestyle or a chance to chase their dreams, she said.</p>
<p>Full-time, high-status work doesn’t necessarily foster stability, she suggested.</p>
<p>“I have seen a poor lawyer, so there is evidence that there is no guarantee of success if you go to get higher education or certification,” Lifshitz said. “But your innovative idea might be the key to changing our world tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Those young entrepreneurs just like me three years ago when I started to establish my first company,” she added. “I was afraid of the unknown risks, but my mother was telling me that she trusted me, so I felt I can do it.” Her advice to Taiwanese startup founders: “Just go for it.”</p>

He encouraged businesses to continue partnering with the government in growing the economy and building an environment of peace and prosperity for all.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s economy grew nearly 2.6 percent in 2017, the premier said, outpacing growth from the year before. In December, the unemployment rate dropped to around 3.6 percent while imports and exports rose noticeably compared with the same period in previous years. And according to surveys by various job banks, nearly half the companies in Taiwan raised salaries following the government’s move to grant a 3-percent pay raise in the public sector.</p>
<p>The government’s foremost agenda is to boost the economy, Premier Lai emphasized. When President Tsai Ing-wen took office, she advocated new economic policies for making Taiwan stronger. First, the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program will meet Taiwan’s infrastructure needs for the next generation. The expansion in government expenditures will spur private spending and further boost the economy.</p>
<p>Second, the “five plus two” innovative industries policy brings seven designated industries under special Executive Yuan oversight in order to transform Taiwan’s economic structure. Third, the New Southbound Policy to court South and Southeast Asian countries coincides with the “Indo-Pacific” strategy espoused by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. As seen from last year’s results, Taiwan’s bilateral trade with Southbound countries continued to expand, while the number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan broke the 10 million mark.</p>
<p>In efforts to drum up investments in Taiwan, the premier has called a series of interministerial meetings to remove the hurdles that stymie potential investors. Addressing shortages of land, water, electricity, labor and experienced personnel, the meetings took stock of all issues and systematically formed concrete strategies.</p>

<p>The main substance of the Act’s 22 Articles is as follows:<br />
The Act distinguishes between three categories of foreign professionals, namely “foreign senior professionals,” “foreign special professionals” and “foreign professionals,” with each receiving distinct benefits under separate provisions. Definitions of these three terms, and of what constitutes “professional work,” are set out in Article 4.</p>
<p>Article 5 separates the work permit application process for school teachers from that for other foreign professionals, transferring administration from the Ministry of Labor to the Ministry of Education, with the aim of encouraging schools to expand their recruitment of foreign teachers.</p>
<p>The Act broadens the range of subjects that foreign nationals can be employed to teach in short-term tutorial schools (so-called buxibans). Previously, such teaching was limited to foreign languages. Now, under Article 6, buxibans may, with due approval in each case, employ foreign nationals with specialized knowledge or skills to teach non-academic classes.</p>
<p>Article 7 extends the duration of work permits for foreign special professionals from three to five years, and provides for the coterminous residence of their spouses and minor children. It also introduces a new provision that their adult children, if unable to live independently due to physical or mental disability, may reside continuously with them, rather than having to leave and reapply for a new visa every six months as before.</p>
<p>Article 8 introduces the Employment Gold Card (EGC) for foreign senior professionals. Comparable to Singapore’s Personalized Employment Pass (PEP), these 4-in-1 cards combine work permit, resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC) and re-entry permit.</p>
<p>Article 9 confers a tax benefit on high-salaried foreign special professionals coming to work in Taiwan for the first time. For three years, only half of their salary above NT$3 million (approx. US$100,000) will be counted in the computation of their income tax liability.</p>
<p>Article 10 provides for foreign artists to obtain freelance work permits of up to three years at a time.</p>
<p>Article 11 brings foreign professionals under coverage of the Labor Pension Act’s retirement pension system.</p>
<p>Article 12 brings foreign public school teachers under the same retirement regulations as apply to Taiwanese public school teachers. It means that they will now be entitled to opt for either a one-time lump-sum pension payment or a monthly pension, the latter of which was denied to them before.</p>
<p>Article 13 allows foreign special professionals’ lineal ascendants (parents or grandparents) to stay with them in Taiwan for up to a year at a time, matching similar benefits conferred in Singapore.</p>
<p>Article 14 addresses a previous cause of hardship by including the spouses, minor children, and adult disabled children of foreign professionals under coverage of National Health Insurance as soon as they have obtained documentary proof of residence, instead of having to wait six months for this benefit as before.</p>
<p>Article 15 provides for foreign senior professionals and their spouses and dependent children to apply together for permanent residency.</p>
<p>Article 16 makes more liberal provision for permanent-resident foreign professionals’ spouses and dependent children (both minor and disabled adult) to apply for permanent residency.</p>
<p>Article 17 creates a new right for the adult non-citizen children of permanent-resident foreign professionals to apply for open work permits, provided they meet specified criteria for length of residence in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Article 18 greatly liberalizes the rules governing cancellation of permanent residence, allowing a permanent resident to stay away from Taiwan for up to five years at a time without risking loss of APRC.</p>
<p>Article 19 introduces a new job-seeking visa, allowing foreign professionals to stay in or repeatedly visit Taiwan for up to six months for the purpose of seeking employment.</p>
<p>Articles 20 and 21 respectively specify the Act’s application to residents of Hong Kong and Macau, and to citizens who come to work or seek work as holders of foreign passports. Article 22 empowers the Executive Yuan to decide when the Act comes into effect.</p>
<h2>Will it make much difference?</h2>
<p>Although not all foreign white-collar workers in Taiwan, whether already living and working there or intending to do so, will benefit from this new Act, there are many to whom it will deliver significant benefits. For some, those benefits might be very substantial, and could make all the difference as to whether or not they are willing to work and settle in Taiwan. Together with other measures to build a more business-friendly and more internationalized environment, including initiatives to enhance the provision of English information, signage and services, they should prove to be an important part of enabling Taiwan to compete with the likes of Singapore in attracting the international talent that it essentially needs for realizing the fullest potential of its economic development.</p>
<p>University teachers are among the foremost beneficiaries of the Act, gaining the much improved pension rights that have long pleaded for. In conjunction with the amendment of the Nationality Act that opens the door for foreign professors to obtain ROC citizenship without having to renounce their original nationality, and with the Yushan Project under which the government will subsidize higher remuneration for elite foreign and local professors, it should substantially help universities to recruit and retain high-quality foreign academic staff.</p>
<p>Many of Taiwan’s foreign residents and frequent visitors rhapsodize about their affection for the island, preferring it to anywhere else in East Asia, or even anywhere in the whole world. Taiwan’s gorgeous natural beauty, rich scope for outdoor activities, kind and friendly people, vibrant culture, free and open society, and many other attributes, appeal to them deeply. It’s common to hear long-term residents tell how they came to study Chinese, or for a short work assignment, or just stopping by on a swing through Asia, never intending a protracted stay, but liked it so much that they’ve stayed and stayed, and no long expect to ever leave.</p>
<p>But on the negative side, they chafe at being constantly restricted and thwarted by illiberal laws and regulations, excluded from sharing the rights and benefits enjoyed by local citizens, yet denied a fair path to becoming citizens by naturalization. In the end, many decide they have to leave. More favourable job conditions beckon them to other parts of Asia – Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and the fast developing economies of Southeast Asia in particular – or back to North America, Europe, or wherever they were born and grew up. Those countries gain, Taiwan loses. And usually, their departure is a double loss to Taiwan, for it loses not only the human capital of these well educated, highly skilled and resourceful people, but also loses their family members – bilingual, bicultural children who could be treasures of the future for Taiwan if they stayed.</p>
<p>If this Act makes enough of a difference to persuade at least some of such people to stay in Taiwan, under better conditions for building careers and leading full lives, as well as luring a good many more to come and join them, then it will deliver an ample return for its making. Whether or not it does achieve as much as might be hoped for, it certainly does mark a major shift in a positive direction.</p>
<h2>Thumbs up for the Act!</h2>
<p><a title="Forward Taiwan" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42015">Forward Taiwan</a><a title="Forward Taiwan" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/42015">,</a>a group at the forefront of advocacy for immigration reform, has hailed the Act’s passage while warning against the danger of backtracking through the insertion of limitations in subsidiary regulations and letters of interpretation. But provided these are drawn up fully in accordance with the spirit and intention of the Act, the result should be a much improved environment and freer opportunity for high-skilled foreign workers in Taiwan.<br />
There is, without doubt, a great deal in the Act for those covered by it to be pleased about. As expressed by Michael Fahey, a long-resident legal consultant who has been closely involved in pressing the case for more liberal treatment of foreign residents and their families: “We are in a celebratory mood – this is the most important development for the international community since the advent of permanent residence at the turn of the century.”</p>

<h2>Why the need?</h2>
<p>The Act was drafted by the National Development Council (NDC) to address the pressing need for more effectively attracting and retaining international talent, to fill growing shortages in Taiwan’s domestic talent pool. As the NDC explained, “In this era of the globalized knowledge economy, sufficiency and quality of talent is a core factor in international competitiveness. Taiwan is currently facing the challenges of an exodus of talent and fierce competition among countries to attract talent. Hence, this law is drawn up to enhance Taiwan’s recruitment and employment of foreign talent, and thus raise its ability to compete internationally.”</p>
<p>Even without the exodus of talent referred to by the NDC, Taiwan was already facing a talent shortage in many key areas. This stems largely from demographic causes, as Taiwan’s very low birth rate – one of the world’s lowest – has caused the working age population to shrink steadily year by year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a serious brain drain is exacerbating this situation, as large numbers of Taiwan’s best and brightest are lured abroad by higher pay and better career prospects in China and elsewhere. The OECD has assessed Taiwan as having the world’s most serious total emigrant brain drain, while the UK economic research institution Oxford Economics has forecast that by 2021 Taiwan will have the most acute brain drain of any country in the world.</p>
<p>These circumstances pose a massive threat to Taiwan’s future economic development, and make it absolutely essential for Taiwan to lure in more of the personnel it needs to fill these deficiencies of technical, managerial, and other vital kinds of high-skilled talent in its work force.</p>
<p>According to a survey by international human resources firm Manpower Group, released in November 2016, 73 percent of 1,005 employers polled in Taiwan said that finding talent was difficult. This figure, the second worst among the 43 countries and regions surveyed, was up by 16 percentage points from the corresponding survey of a year earlier, underlining how fast the situation is going from bad to worse.</p>
<p>These shortages evidently cannot be rectified, at least in the near term, only by measures to improve the supply and retention of local talent. Such measures are important, but cannot be enough on their own. Therefore, the only other way to respond to them is by measures to promote an increased inflow of foreign talent.</p>
<p>However, businesses – both local and foreign – have long complained about the difficulties of recruiting key international talent to meet staffing needs that they cannot fill through local recruitment. This has been impeded by a host of regulatory barriers restricting the residence and employment of foreign nationals. On top of this, foreign professionals who do take up residence and employment in Taiwan have found their lives and careers so limited by hard-to-endure regulatory constraints that many elect to move away to countries where they can expect to enjoy more favourable treatment.</p>
<p>Against this background, it is only too clear that Taiwan’s government needs to be doing as much as it possibly can to attract high-skilled personnel from around the world.</p>
<h2>Who does Taiwan need?</h2>
<p>High-skilled white-collar personnel needed to fill managerial, technical, marketing and other positions in local or foreign-invested industrial and commercial enterprises are by no means the only kind of foreign talent that Taiwan needs to attract. Its universities are in dire need of attracting more high-quality teaching staff to enhance their internationalization and reverse their falling trend in international rankings. This need, again, has been made all the more urgent by a sharp exodus of academic staff poached by universities on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>At the same time that its universities need help in attracting more international faculty, they also need help in attracting more international students. With the depressed birth rate resulting in steeply falling enrolment in higher education, many universities and university departments are struggling to attract even the bare minimum of students that they need for their very survival. Being better able to attract foreign students will not only provide a means of overcoming this difficulty, but will also supply a promising source of future talent for all parts of the economy.</p>
<p>As advanced economies have long understood and taken full advantage of, attracting foreign students pays great dividends over time if at least some of them stay to work after they graduate. Having become at least partly acculturated, and most likely having acquired at least some proficiency in local languages, they will be able to adapt to the local work environment and integrate into the local society much better than people recruited at a later stage of their lives. If, as will often be the case, they form families and settle permanently, the host economy and society will gain yet more.</p>
<p>That is why countries such as Germany and Norway seek to attract foreign students with free-tuition policies, which they know will pay them back many times over with ensuing gains to their work force and population. Such benefit is truly invaluable in today’s advanced economies, especially for an aging and soon-to-be hyper-aging society that pressingly needs a transfusion of young blood to offset its worsening demographic imbalance.</p>
<p>Another segment of foreign talent that Taiwan needs to set out its stall to attract is entrepreneurs, especially young entrepreneurs with innovative ideas for business startups that match the government’s ambitious plans for connecting Taiwan to global tech clusters and creating new industries for the next generation, as embodied in the Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan launched in September 2016. While Taiwanese themselves have plenty of the skills, vision and know-how for achieving these goals, an increased inflow of foreign talent to augment the talent supply can only enhance the startup and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The multi-faceted value they bring, for strengthening international linkages, broadening target horizons, and opening up optimal opportunities for global marketing success, can hardly be overstated.</p>
<p>So the needs for attracting well qualified and able foreign nationals to Taiwan is clear enough. But other countries, including Taiwan’s main economic rivals, also have a similar need, and have previously responded to it more proactively than Taiwan.</p>
<p>While the competition to attract the cream of the international work force has continued to intensify, Taiwan has lagged well behind others in luring such people to its shores and keeping them when they do come. The numbers attest to this all too starkly. According to figures released by the Ministry of Labor, there were fewer than 32,000 foreign white-collar professionals working in Taiwan as of the end of March this year. Well over a quarter were Japanese, roughly one-sixth were American, and a little over one thousand each were from Canada and the UK. Almost a quarter of those with work permits were teachers, while just one in eight, or less than 4,000, were employed in providing professional, scientific and technical services.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Singapore where, according to figures released by the Ministry of Manpower, as of June 2017, there were 189,900 foreign nationals working under the Employment Pass for foreign professionals, managers and executives, plus 179,400 with the S Pass for mid-level skilled staff – a total of 369,300 white-collar foreign workers versus Taiwan’s 32,000, or more than eleven times as many, despite Singapore having a resident population (citizens and permanent residents) of under 4 million versus Taiwan’s resident population of more than 23 million.</p>
<p>This, then, is the background against which the NDC mapped out the provisions of the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals.</p>
<h2>How did the Act get made?</h2>
<p>Having well appreciated the need for across-the-board revision of laws and regulations to create more open and welcoming conditions for foreign professionals to live and work in Taiwan, the NDC set the ball rolling in October 2016 by mapping out a set of proposals for liberalizations relating to visas, residence, insurance, naturalization, retirement and other pertinent matters, to make Taiwan’s work environment friendlier and thereby encourage foreign talent to come to Taiwan and stay here. In mapping these out, it consulted the views and suggestions of foreign chambers of commerce and other representatives of the expatriate community, and considered what measures advanced and competitor countries such as the U.S., UK, Japan, Korea and Singapore had taken to achieve similar purposes.</p>
<p>Since the wide ambit of the proposed legislation involved the jurisdiction of many different departments of government, the NDC needed to conduct extensive coordination with the authorities concerned to finalize the terms of the draft Act.</p>
<p>After the draft was completed and had been approved by the Premier and President, it was posted on the Online Public Policy Participation Platform for the requisite period of public notice and comment, and was submitted to the Legislative Yuan in late April 2017.</p>
<p>While the first draft of the Act included provision by which select foreign nationals might have a chance of gaining ROC nationality without having to renounce any other citizenship, narrowly conferring as a privilege what foreign residents have long argued ought to be liberally granted as a right, this was instead provided for by amendment of the Nationality Act, and therefore removed from the final draft.</p>
<p>Although the draft Act received strong cross-partisan support in the legislature, some voices were raised against it, expressing exaggerated fears of foreigners pouring in to displace local people from jobs. Fortunately, such short-sighted, blinkered and ill-considered arguments did not prevail. But objections were successful against provisions that would have allowed foreign university students or graduates out of school less than two years to come to Taiwan for internships of up to two years. In light of assertions that this could be abused by businesses as a means of taking in low-paid foreign interns to replace higher salaried local employees, these provisions were excised. But apart from this, the other provisions of the draft were endorsed with only relatively small modifications, and <a title="it passed its third reading in the legislature" href="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=4061A3F0B105B5AE&amp;s=E96CA8D98401E172">it passed its third reading in the legislature</a> on October 30, 2017.</p>
<p>One of the strongest advocates of the law during the enactment process was legislator Karen Yu (余宛如). As Yu explained in an <a title="interview" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/41840">interview</a> for BusinessNext, the main purpose of the Act was to help local industries, especially those enterprises with their sights set on going global. She emphasized that “every single industry would benefit from foreign talent,” and citing her own experience as an entrepreneur, suggested that foreign talent is often a crucial ingredient for success.</p>
<p>While this Act has already been added to Taiwan’s statute law, much work remains to be done before it can be put into effect. Many sets of subsidiary regulations and letters of interpretation must be drafted by the various agencies concerned. For example, regulations for teachers must be set by the Ministry of Education, regulations on the issuance of Employment Gold Cards must be set by the Ministry of the Interior in consultation with the Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and regulations on artist work permits must be set by the Ministry of Labor in consultation with the Ministry of Culture. The NDC is actively coordinating the completion of all subsidiary measures, and expects all to be ready for the Act to go into effect before the Chinese New Year in 2018.</p>

Economists also anticipate that new and much unregulated financing options will appear via crypto-currencies.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should begin exploring these new financing options, but understand the inherit risks of each.</p>
<p>ICSB NUMBER ONE TREND FOR 2018 :MSMEs PROTECTING THEIR ASSETS<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> The value of MSMEs lies in their assets. The assets can range from the customer base and know-how, to location, business service, and reputation. These unique assets need to be protected now more than ever before because more threats are coming that no one has ever experienced.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Protect your core assets! Do not think that because you are an MSME you are not a prime candidate for an attack. Also, own and protect your brand.</p>', '5e1/012/065/5e1012065a45a534036810.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

ICSB polled its global experts to help identify the 2018 Top Ten Trends for MSMES. ICSB predicts that 2018 will be a very positive year for the majority of MSMEs and with a higher level increase of support from governments. These Top Ten Trends below is a list of what MSMEs need to prepare for and utilize in their businesses.</p>
<p>NUMBER 10 TREND : MSMEs TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs are the fabric of communities, reaching many sustainable development goals without realizing it. Yet, they can be empowered to do more. MSMEs can become the measuring stick of how we are achieving SDGs.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should make the SDGs a prominent feature to demonstrate why consumers should buy from them to further support the SDGs. If a consumer sees an MSME engaged in the SDGs, they will further support it. Like buying organic or recycling, MSMEs should allow consumers to contribute to a sustainable world.</p>
<p>NUMBER 9 TREND: SMEs: DOING GOOD AND DOING WELL CAN CO-EXIST!<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> This is also known as social entrepreneurship. Yet, why give it a label if this can be the norm? MSMEs should have social entrepreneurship as a standard operating procedure and not a diversion from their core business strategy.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Educators, policy-makers, and consultants should educate, encourage, and assist MSMEs to develop the framework for this new operating model.</p>
<p>NUMBER 8 TREND: A GROWING ECONOMY REQUIRES A FORMAL ECONOMY<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> Bringing businesses from the informal to the formal economy must occur through incentives, not threats. The best way to attract MSMEs is through direct benefits, such as loans, government contracts, and access to the global marketplace.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Governments need to propose a set of clear and enticing incentives to encourage informal companies to switch. Until then, it is a missed opportunity for both parties.</p>
<p>NUMBER 7 TREND: GROWTH IS EASIER THAN EVER FOR MSMEs<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> MSMEs now have the opportunity to expand their reach and influence through more mediums than ever before. If you have a website, you are a global _rm. If you accept online payments, you can export. The impediments to grow are shrinking every day. However, competition and the ability to build a successful strategy is increasing daily.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Plan to grow your business through smart strategies that leverage today’s technology and ease of doing business. If you do not have a plan, someone else will steal your customers.</p>
<p>NUMBER 6 TREND: MSMEs TO ADJUST FOR DISRUPTION<br />
<strong>INSIGHT:</strong> Unforeseen events will happen; how MSMEs adjust to them will determine their long-term survival and effectiveness. SMEs must plan to handle unexpected disruptions more quickly and creatively. A contingency plan is no longer optional.<br />
<strong>ICSB RECOMMENDATION:</strong> MSMEs should build contingency plans to accommodate major temporary disruptions in to their operations. This is done through preplanning and not after the fact.</p>', '5e1/012/068/5e10120683e85209389460.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>The winning enterprises all share a common set of strengths: outstanding operations and excellent records of achievement, harmonious relations among workers and management and a shared sense of common welfare, and innovative approaches to business and operations. Premier Lai expressed hope that the spirit and success of these award-winning businesses can stand as a source of learning and encouragement for other SMEs in the pursuit of ever more robust growth.</p>
<p>Seeing the challenges facing economic development in Taiwan following her inauguration, President Tsai Ing-wen chose to tackle the issue on three fronts, said the premier. First, on the industrial front, the president pledged support for ongoing improvements in techniques and technology among the nation’s businesses, and put forward the “five plus two” innovative industries plan to spur the next generation of industrial development. Second, with respect to expanding government spending, the Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program was proposed as a conduit for increased public spending aimed at encouraging greater investment by the private sector.</p>
<p>Third, on the trade policy front, the government is promoting the New Southbound Policy. Taiwan’s economy has continued to grow for the past 20 years thanks in part to westward business expansion into mainland China. However, as costs associated with land, labor, environmental protection and capital acquisition in mainland China have continued to rise, the government introduced the New Southbound Policy to assist in the continued development of Taiwan’s business community.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the universal expectation that the government pursue economic growth as a primary duty, Premier Lai said that the Executive Yuan is actively promoting six concrete policies to boost Taiwan’s economy. The first is a 3 percent pay raise for public employees. Second, the government is knocking down barriers to investment in Taiwan. The third is reform of the nation’s tax system, while the fourth is active pursuit of deregulation. The fifth and sixth policies are the implementation of President Tsai’s Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program and the “five plus two” innovative industries plan.</p>
<p>Finally, the Ministry of Labor has already posted draft amendments to the Labor Standards Act that would change the current requirement of one mandatory day off per week together with one flexible day off, and is now accepting public comments for one week. The Executive Yuan will then make a final decision, and expects to send the revisions to the Legislative Yuan for review before the middle of November. Premier Lai said that the amended act upholds the vision of President Tsai, protecting the safety and interests of workers while at the same time providing flexibility for companies and their employees.</p>', '5e1/012/069/5e10120699cc9782865596.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

The premier made the remarks after a briefing by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on its use of the credit guarantee support mechanism for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and innovative startups.</p>
<p>The Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund of Taiwan has been effective in helping SMEs access business financing, and should continue to do so, the premier said. He instructed the MOEA and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to encourage the Bankers Association of the Republic of China and the nation’s financial institutions to extend more assistance and strategic support to SMEs as well as new types of businesses such as youth-driven startups and social enterprises.</p>
<p>The MOEA and FSC should also work closely on expanding a forward-looking SME financing service platform to promote the development of financial technology, mobile payments and business innovation. Through these efforts, the credit guarantee mechanism will fulfill the objectives of helping new businesses and supporting innovation, Premier Lai said.</p>
<p>According to the MOEA, Taiwan’s 1.4 million-plus SMEs account for 97.22 percent of all firms in the country, forming the bedrock of Taiwan’s economic security. The government has therefore made it a priority to help SMEs access the funds needed to grow. Since the SME Credit Guarantee Fund came under the remit of the MOEA in 2003, it has been instrumental in assisting businesses that lack sufficient loan collateral. In recent years, the fund has helped Taiwan firms obtain NT$1.3 trillion (US$43.0 billion) in financing annually and secured 1.4 million job opportunities.</p>', '5e1/012/06a/5e101206ae455060753254.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

In addition to wishing the lab much success and a fruitful future, he hoped that by connecting with the global community to learn how best to implement policies domestically, it could also share Taiwan’s own experiences with other countries. He also expressed hope that the concept of social enterprises would take root across Taiwan.</p>
<p>The government will make three commitments to supporting the Social Innovation Lab, the premier pledged. The first is market deregulation. The Executive Yuan has already sent a bill on financial technology innovation to the Legislative Yuan, where it will hopefully be approved quickly. The Executive Yuan is also considering easing restrictions in the Company Act so that social enterprises can maintain their overall direction and integrity, whether their investments come from financial companies, large corporations, or small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The second commitment is to direct the Executive Yuan’s subordinate agencies to support the lab’s efforts moving forward. The third is to encourage capital investments from private companies, because government resources are limited whereas private resources are not, the premier said.

They were there to witness the innovation and creative capabilities of SMEs in developing Taiwan&#8217;s circular economy.</p>
<p>SMEA Deputy Director General Su Wen-Ling noted that discussions on sustainability in the past have mainly focused on how to reduce the damage caused to the environment by industrial development. Current discussions on the circular economy not only focus on being environmentally friendly and reducing waste, but also on designing technologies, processes, and products that are based on concepts of circulation and renewal, in order to create a positive effect on the natural environment and economic activities. Su Wen-Ling pointed out that Taiwan relies on imports for over 90% of its energy and resources, and over 60% of its food. We must therefore consider how to help resources continually circulate and be reused. The circular economy, a topic of future sustainability, is set to become the main direction for innovative economic models and market demand creation, not only in Taiwan, but around the world.

A total of 22 enterprises and 3 science and technology universities, all involved in renewable energy, green lighting, energy conservation and environmental protection, and green transportation, were invited. Numerous company representatives arrived to experience the nearly 30 innovative technologies and green energy applications, and also engaged in lively interactions.</p>
<p>One of the goals of renewable energy has always been to lower the threshold for power generation and to utilize even more natural resources. Target Solar Company and Green Energy Technology Inc. jointly showed off their lightweight, portable, even bendable solar panels. These will allow solar power to more easily become a part of daily life. True Ten Industrial Company has developed a mobile hydroelectric generator. Zhen Xin Technology Company&#8217;s run-of-the-river micro-hydroelectric power generation system can successfully use the kinetic energy of smaller water currents for power generation, increasing the scope of application for power generation systems. These technologies made the renewable energy exhibit quite eye-catching. The five enterprises in the green lighting area were focused on vision care and design requirements for various lighting situations. They were introducing green lighting material solutions with different materials and functional characteristics, making them the absolute center of attention.</p>
<p>The energy conservation and environmental protection area, which had the most exhibitors this time, displayed the abundant results of SMEs&#8217; pursuit of environmental sustainability over the past few years. TecHome Technology Company is the first spin-off of National Cheng Kung University. The company surprised the industry by transforming reservoir sludge, so troubling to water resource departments for the past several decades, into popular materials for interior design and decoration companies. Insheng Engineering Company, the only production process company in the world to independently develop production equipment, modules, and unique designs, has developed an energy efficient, high power chemical plastic pump that has impressed even the major European companies. The electric compression garbage truck of Dokin Motors Company, the electric logistics equipment of Noveltek, and the energy and transportation solution of Digi-Triumph Technology Inc. for green logistics parks were displayed in the green transportation area. These provided more efficient application systems for the constant evolution of Industry 4.0. The 3 key science and technology universities in Southern Taiwan, namely Kun Shan University, Far East University, and Chia Nan University of Pharmacy &amp; Science, also showed off numerous environmental, energy efficient, and innovative products, giving the green ideas of college students good exposure.</p>
<p>Taiwan&#8217;s SMEs are overflowing with innovative energy, and have always been the key to driving Taiwan&#8217;s economic development. The SMEA selects different themes for business events based on industrial trends each year. This gives enterprises the opportunity to work together in technology, marketing, and capital, and also to gain exposure in the media.

The event&#8217;s purpose is to better prepare SMEs for cyber security risks.</p>
<p>“Efforts made to assist SMEs in digital transformation are seen not only in APEC, but also across the world,” said Dr. Ming-Ji Wu, Director General of SMEA. However, digital economy still has challenges despite its many benefits. Cyber security is an urgent topic that we need to be cautious about. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, for instance, has significantly affected global businesses and is a wakeup call.</p>
<p>In response to this growing concern, APEC SME Digital Resilience Training Workshop invites cybersecurity specialists from Thailand, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore to share their knowledge and experiences. The workshop aims to strengthen SMEs’ awareness and digital competitiveness and resilience capabilities, as well as cyber security management.</p>
<p>Global Tech Giants Fortify SME Security Defense<br />
In collaboration with the Philippines and Malaysia, SMEA proposed “APEC Online-to-Offline (O2O) Initiative &#8211; Enhancing SME Digital Competitiveness and Resilience towards Quality Growth” which is now at the 2nd phase. In its grand opening at Kaohsiung Exhibition Center on July 13, 20 professionals from 7 economies who can train around 100 seed trainers with their cyber threats defending skills were invited. When returning home, they will be able to help local SMEs to reinforce digital competitiveness and resilience.</p>
<p>Aside from knowledge-based lectures, train-the-trainer courses are designed to simulate real cyber-attacks and create realistic experiences where participants can build up their abilities to make prompt decisions, and gain better understanding of procedures to safeguard their companies.</p>
<p>Through interactive and sharing sessions, seed trainers can play a role to facilitate cross-border cooperation, build stronger partnerships, and raise digital resilience and cyber security awareness for SMEs.</p>
<p>Seed trainers are responsible for introducing and implementing the training program in their own countries while teaching SMEs to build applicable security management systems. With the great amount of efforts putting in, SMEs in the Asia-Pacific region can defend themselves against cyber threats.</p>
<p>Deepen Cooperation in Southeast Asia<br />
Chinese Taipei has spared no effort in promoting APEC Accelerator Network (AAN) and its four-year initiative on Business Continuity Planning (BCP).With the same dedication, APEC O2O Expert Network has been established in 2017 with the joint efforts of technology giants, such as Trend Micro and Belfor. In collaboration with information security professionals from APEC economies, the workshop will adopt APEC Guidebook on SME Digital Resilience as training materials to help SMEs improve their capabilities when encountering cyber security challenges.</p>
<p>In 2018, Chinese Taipei will host 9 serial events with 4 co-proposing economies: Malaysia, The Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These events will be held in five cities for the 3rd phase of APEC Online-to-Offline (O2O) Initiative – “Unleash the Potential of SMEs through Digital Transformation for a Shared Future.” Chinese Taipei will continued to play a leading role in exploring and addressing challenges and issues facing SMEs, deepening cooperation among ASEAN countries, and pushing the New Southbound Policy with a more effective approach.</p>
<p>Toward International Cooperation<br />
Kaohsiung City Mayor Chu Chen expressed her appreciation to SMEs for hosting the APEC SME Digital Resilience Training Workshop and the Collaboration between Young Entrepreneurs of Kaohsiung &amp; ASEAN in Kaohsiung. Seed trainers recommended by APEC member economies will strengthen APEC SMEs entrepreneurs’ knowledge in cyber security related field and enhance SME digital competitiveness and resilience. Furthermore, this event will also create a new paradigm for central and local governments to promote startup and international cooperation.</p>', '5e1/012/07d/5e101207db055800841678.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>Aside from this project, the government must also examine overall policies to ensure that Taiwan’s higher education institutes can produce the type of high-quality work force needed to advance national development, the premier said. The Degree Conferral Law should have more flexibility built into it, therefore, and the government must not overlook the importance of the humanities, social sciences and basic research when promoting education in business and other applications.</p>
<p>The premier instructed the MOE to proactively implement the following higher education policies:</p>
<p>1. In a globalized world of technological innovations and rapidly changing industrial environments, the MOE must equip the next generation with core abilities to work across multiple disciplines, think logically and solve problems, achieve innovation through diverse pathways, and apply science and technology. The MOE should make full use of policy tools to create a student-oriented learning environment that will enrich Taiwan’s human capital.</p>
<p>2. The MOE should consider extending experimental education programs to the college level to help students and faculty rediscover their passion for learning and teaching. Alternative schools that have proven successful should be used as examples to spur innovative thinking by universities and keep them up with the times.</p>
<p>3. To broaden the international horizons of Taiwanese students, the MOE should encourage colleges to collaborate with reputable schools abroad and offer joint programs. Greater flexibility should be given to instructors and how courses are designed.</p>
<p>4. In a time of declining birth rates, the MOE should help colleges transform and merge with other institutions by promoting a draft act governing private colleges and universities that are planning to transform or exit the market. This bill should also be given priority in the next session of the Legislature.</p>
<p>According to the MOE, the objectives of the higher education development project are to achieve teaching innovation, help each school develop its own unique character, promote university social responsibility, and make higher education a public resource for all society. Beginning 2018, the project will have an annual budget of NT$17.37 billion (US$571.4 million) and will include two main components: raising the quality of college education across the board while encouraging diversification of higher education, and helping universities become internationally competitive and establish top research centers.</p>', '5e1/012/080/5e10120802725246763341.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>Organized by the Foundation for Women’s Rights Promotion and Development, the event will include guests from the American Institute in Taiwan, NTUT, the National Taiwan Science Education Center, Microsoft Taiwan and the feminist website Womany. Female scientists and engineers across different generations will also share and talk about their personal journeys from education to the workplace. A “3-D printing pen” session will be arranged for participants to experience that technology’s innovative applications for the real world.</p>
<p>The Department of Gender Equality said that the government has been actively encouraging young women to get involved in science and technology to correct the longstanding gender imbalance in these fields. Aside from celebrating Girls in ICT Day, the department has planned a Gendered Innovation for Science and Technology promotional series for 2017 to address various issues surrounding women and technology discussed at recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. This series will include a “women power laboratory” seminar in July, a workshop in September on women using new technology for creativity, and a training course in October on young women in technology. These events will combine gender issues in science and technology across the public and private sectors and present them to young people in a lively fashion, encouraging Taiwanese girls and young women to study and make their careers in science and technology.</p>
<p>Girls in ICT Day, launched by the U.N. in 2011, is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of April each year.

<p>After a briefing by the National Development Council (NDC) on the progress of the Asian Silicon Valley plan, the premier said the key to this plan is human resources, and that Taiwan must attract overseas professionals while providing more room for growth for local talent. To do so, the nation must create an objective environment in terms of regulations, funding, personnel, international connections, value chains and demonstration sites.</p>
<p>Currently, smart city demonstration sites and certifications are the main focus of the internet-of-things (IoT) industry, so the government will first concentrate on smart transportation, smart health care and IoT application platforms to spur domestic industries, the premier said. In Taiwan’s economy, industrial growth has always been driven by technological innovations such as the information technology boom of 20 years ago. The next wave of industrial growth will be driven by the Asian Silicon Valley, particularly by smart technologies that can be applied to industries right now. The premier hopes everyone will work together to lay the foundations for the next wave, and help raise Taiwan’s industries to the next level.</p>
<p>The NDC said the Asian Silicon Valley is the government’s flagship plan for industrial innovation. It aims to develop IoT technologies while building a complete innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. The plan will also focus on IoT security, augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence applications, self-driving vehicles and mobile lifestyles. These efforts will be combined with the New Southbound Policy to take advantage of new economic trends and opportunities.</p>
<p>To create an innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem, the NDC will earmark NT$100 billion (US$3.3 billion) from the National Development Fund for the establishment of an industrial innovation and transformation fund. A bill on the recruitment and hiring of foreign professionals has also been drafted to provide more incentives for working in Taiwan. The NDC is also working with other agencies to promote smart city demonstration sites and certifications, focusing on smart health care and smart transportation, such as making Wi-Fi connections widely available on buses to and from the Taoyuan international airport.</p>', '5e1/012/084/5e10120845c29362943164.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>Taiwan has a vibrant and growing startup scene. In 2015, Taiwanese companies received <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/state-venture-capital-asia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a total of USD440 Million in venture capital</a>, however it is still hard for entrepreneurs to raise the seed money they need to get started.</p>
<p>It is even harder if you are a foreign entrepreneur with fewer family around and basically no chance to borrow from the bank.</p>
<p>Dragons’ Chamber will work to bridge the fundraising gap for entrepreneurs who need to raise up to NTD5 million.</p>
<p>The initiative takers to this event are experienced foreign entrepreneurs who has lived in Taiwan for many years and who understand the challenges of fundraising. For years we have watched the TV show <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragon’s Den</a> offer a platform for entrepreneurs and investors to meet and now we want to do something similar in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Foreign Entrepreneurs in Taiwan contribute a lot to the Taiwanese economy and society. A survey performed by Enspyre on behalf of Taipei Department of Economic Development indicates that companies founded by foreigners have on average twice as many employees and are three times as likely to do international business as the average Taiwanese Small Medium Enterprise (SME).</p>

<p>Speaking to the winners of the 25th National Award of Outstanding SMEs and the 18th Outstanding Overseas Taiwanese SMEs Award, the premier noted that globalization has compelled companies to move offshore, decreased local job opportunities, lowered wages and created an unequal distribution of wealth—all of which have had a serious impact on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Given challenges such as Taiwan’s environmental protection requirements, changing labor conditions and rising land costs, businesses seeking to lower costs, stay competitive and expand their markets have no choice but to relocate to other countries, which has created employment problems in Taiwan, he said. Meanwhile, businesses that want to remain in Taiwan must learn to lower costs and increase production value to meet those challenges. Confident that Taiwanese enterprises can lower production costs, the premier said it is the government’s responsibility to help them increase their industrial value-added.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s future growth hinges on investment, and right now, the nation’s poorer-than-expected economic performance is a clear sign that investment is lacking, the premier said. But to enhance industrial competitiveness, investment must be directed toward innovation and job creation.</p>
<p>The government has made “innovation, employment and equitable distribution” the keynotes of its economic policy, with equitable distribution as the foundation of social stability. Without that foundation, the premier said, there can be no social stability, while enterprise owners that share profits with their employees can attract better talent and create a virtuous cycle of growth.</p>
<p>The government, Lin said, is responsible for creating the basic conditions for a healthy investment environment. Noting public concern about electricity supplies, the premier underscored the administration’s efforts to reform Taiwan’s energy structure and develop renewable energy resources. These efforts include managing peak-load demand, promoting energy conservation and the further diversification of energy sources to ensure that energy demand is met during the transition process.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the government will promote solar and wind power projects, adopt smart grids and time-of-use pricing strategies, and reduce energy demand during peak hours. This will not only ease Taiwan’s energy problems, but also create investment opportunities in the renewable energy sector, he said.</p>
<p>The premier also mentioned the “five plus two” innovative industries policy, which focuses on integrating and investing in existing and new industries. The Asian Silicon Valley plan, for instance, aims to combine Industry 4.0 concepts with computers, smart enterprises, and information and communications technology to make Taiwan globally competitive in smart cities, smart transportation, internet of things technology, and e-finance. Another example is the policy to develop intelligent machinery, which aims to upgrade the machinery industry and integrate industrial, academic and research resources to stay competitive with European and Japanese peers, and keep the industry abreast of the latest developments.</p>
<p>Through the New Southbound Policy, Lin said, the government is also building closer ties with Southeast and South Asian countries to pursue free trade and investment protection agreements, enhance exchanges and cooperation, and create strategic alliances for mutual benefit. He added that under this policy, Taiwanese companies will enjoy greater protection when operating or investing abroad.</p>
<p>In closing, the premier touted small and medium-sized enterprises as the heart of Taiwan’s innovation and job growth. These small but nimble businesses represent Taiwan’s greatest strength due to their capacity for innovation, diversity, and adaptability. Those strengths create many new development opportunities, so the government will facilitate continued growth by helping them overcome obstacles and developing new recruitment channels.</p>', '5e1/012/088/5e10120881980007761483.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>Taoyuan City, with its outstanding growth potential in hardware and software engineering, will be the ideal technology hub for the Asian Silicon Valley plan, Premier Lin said.</p>
<p>Since taking office in May, the administration has been promoting the “five plus two” innovative industries—an Asian Silicon Valley, biomedicine, green energy technology, intelligent machinery and national defense, plus a new agricultural paradigm and a circular economy. The Asian Silicon Valley plan is among the most important as it focuses on gathering talent and relaxing regulations for innovative businesses. The initiative is also expected to expand Taiwan’s presence in the global economy, the premier said.</p>
<p>The founding of the Taoyuan Enterprise Chamber marks an important milestone. Through the chamber, consisting of nearly a hundred exceptional enterprises, companies can link with other sectors, create business opportunities, learn from one another, form partnerships and share experiences. The chamber will also serve as their platform for participating in public affairs and offering policy recommendations, which would be of significant help to the government, Lin said.</p>
<p>While the government is responsible for promoting the people’s well-being and improving society, businesses are a main driving force behind advancements in society, he continued. The government therefore must understand and meet the needs of businesses and create a healthy environment that will bring economic growth and prosperity to all.</p>

<p>A key requirement of a good policymaker is to have compassion and enthusiasm for society. The individual should also possess the ability to think rationally, staying critical of current policies in order to come up with ways to improve them, Lin said.</p>
<p>Public policies must be aimed at solving the problems and issues that concern people, he continued. The more public attention to an issue, the more important the policy will be, such as the case of pension reform. In addition, a policymaker must listen to public opinion and consider the matter carefully in order to uncover the critical issues and find the solutions.</p>

(PART II)', '2016-08-05', 'news', '<p>After sharing <a href="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/now-you-get-your-funding-whats-next/">their stories</a>, the co-founders of CardinalBlue, Deepblu and Mesh Ventures investment are ready to take question on “the next steps” after getting the funding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you contact venture capitalists / start-ups?</strong></p>
<p>Brad: I believe that it’s important for start-ups to meet the right person. And for Deepblu, it was TSS (<a href="http://www.startupstadium.tw/overview/">Taiwan Startup Stadium</a>). In many of their projects, they did a lot of analysis and were willing to put in resources. After this, we went for international start-up competitions and events, such as <a href="http://www.ricebusinessplancompetition.com/">RICE</a> and <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/">Tech in Asia</a>. We got to know some other venture capitalists in the process.</p>
<p>John: If you consider your stuff international and can be sold abroad, go try in the Silicon Valley. Another thing is <a href="http://www.angel.co/">AngelList</a>, kind of like facebook for start-ups where you can write introduction to your group and investors to contact you more easily there.</p>
<p>It is important for start-ups to build a “angel investor portfolio.” The key difference between a good and a bad angel is their emotion management (Everybody laughed). You should go look for feedback from companies that have received their funding after 1 or two years.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you deal with the valuation?</strong></p>
<p>John: We asked our neighbor in the accelerator and reported similar amount, which was 3 million at the first time.  I don’t think valuation is that important for start-ups. Dropbox didn’t do well on that at first either.</p>
<p>Ben: Usually, I would first like to know what problems this start-up is trying to solve. Every problem is an opportunity, so is this problem big enough? Secondly, I would like to know whether this group is suitable for doing the things they want. We spend time getting to know “people”, like the CTO and CEO of the company.</p>
<p>For some people, I will give them money even after they fail at the tenth time. I want to be part of their future success.</p>
<p>Regarding valuation, especially in seed round, there is really no reference. The only thing that matters is whether there’s investor willing to give the amount you want. By the way, investors who are willing to pay much may not be the best choice. It may be because they don’t understand what you are doing exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are the next steps after getting the funding?</strong></p>
<p>Brad: We moved to a new office, not for “enjoying the money”. Before we got the funding, our group of 11 people worked in a very small and “cozy” place, we needed a better working environment and to start recruiting. Besides this, we spent most money on recruitment. Deepblu sells high-end products, we need the best employees who are stress resistant and able to design the best products. So, we spent time and money advertising and head-hunting abroad. It depends on companies. To us, employees matter.</p>
<p>John: Like what I just mentioned, the first investor for CardinalBlue was a VC firm from the Silicon Valley who wanted us to expand. So we hired a very expensive BD and spent a lot of money on PR. They even suggested us to buy users. In this process, we discovered that we can do BD, PR ourselves. I think they are great investors. They wanted CardinalBlue to become what they wanted it to be. But we have our own way to go, so do most start-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there problems that cannot be solved with money?</strong></p>
<p>Brad: Without money, nothing is possible. With money, not everything is possible. Money is no guarantee for living happily ever after. Money can’t help us on the relationship with the board of directors, or avoid to stop our collaboration with one co-founder because of the plan for the future started to differ.</p>
<p>In addition, employees can be another source of pain. I think people is really the key. Especially early employees influence the culture of the organization. My advice is to look for people slowly and fire people rapidly.</p>
<p>John: You cannot buy the feeling of being poor with money. When you have 2 million dollars in the bank account, it is hard to run as fast as if you are running out of money. Thus, it is very important to remind yourself the feeling when you had nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should investors interact with start-ups?</strong></p>
<p>Ben: I think it’s better to be themselves. One can never fake long. Of course we like good news. But please don’t forget we need bad news as well, in the first place. If we don’t know what happened, how can we help? Maybe I happened to know a software guy who can solve your problem in 15 minutes through telephone. Investors usually know more people than you do. But you have to let them know your need. Also, please provide us possible solutions when telling us your problem. You should take your time and come up with a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How should we schedule fundraising plans?</strong></p>
<p>Ben: We do have some general principles regarding this WHEN question. According to our experience, there’s a 6-month interval between the day you start fundraising and the day you receive the money. For early start-up, it will be better to use this money to survive the first 2 years.</p>
<p>Brad: There’s a kind of girl in school who always says she doesn’t want a boyfriend because she wants to focus on schoolwork. After a while, she goes out with another guy. I think start-ups can learn from this story when facing VCs.  You can act as if you don’t need them. However, this is only feasible when you have some money to survive at the time. If this is the case, you can stay open to any possible investors.</p>

Because of this, many entrepreneurs share their experiences about getting venture capital, investors and pitching in business forums. However, are you curious about the next step? Shall we use the money to hire sales person or engineers? What are some problems that cannot be solved with money?</p>
<p>This time in School for Entrepreneur Forum, guest speakers talk about the “next steps” after getting the capitals. We are pleased to invite Brad, co-founder of Deepblu, John, co-founder of CardinalBlue and Ben, co-founder of the Taiwanese venture capital firm Mesh Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Deepblu: communication, goal and control</strong></p>
<p>Brad Chen is the co-founder of <a href="http://deepblu.com/">Deepblu</a>, a startup providing diving log and social network service that sells also their diving smart watch. They just receive seed funding last year in 2015. Before Deepblu, Brad worked in the semiconductor and IT industry for 12 years. But he never forget his passion for diving.</p>
<p>Brad Chen is the co-founder of <a href="http://deepblu.com/">Deepblu</a>, a startup providing diving log and social network service that sells also their diving smart watch. They just receive seed funding last year in 2015. Before Deepblu, Brad worked in the semiconductor and IT industry for 12 years. But he never forget his passion for diving.</p>
<p>“Deepblu was founded in 2013, providing diving product and service. We aimed to build a service emphasizing the social aspect of this sport, which is based on sharing people’s experience. Last month, we released Deepblu in Singapore. Our goal is to become a international company.”</p>
<p>“Many people thought that Deepblu was just a wearable device or a watch for diving. It is more than that. Diving itself is very enjoyable, just like flying in the blue sky. But do you know how painful it is to sit down and write the diving log afterwards? Our platform is here to solve this pain. Deepblu helps you upload what you have seen during the diving session, including dive profiles, depth value and scenes and share them with friends.”</p>
<p>According to Brad, they are the first company with this technology in Taiwan. The price of the watch is set to be 10,000 NT dollars (around 300 USD).  The estimated revenue this year can hit 100 million. “I have a dream that one day human being will treat the ocean in a more friendly way. We unintentionally destroy things that we don’t understand well. The ocean is dying. However, I believe that people will change after getting to know the ocean.”</p>
<p><strong>“Many people asked me how to spend the money. Well, I believe that the funding means responsibility. It’s just the beginning. You should be thinking about the next steps. </strong></p>
<p>“There are 3 important things. The first is communication. As a leader, you need good communication with the board of directors and your investors. You may even want to meet with them more often than your wife (he laughed). The second is your goal. Sometimes people forget their goals after they receive funding. This may lead to inefficiency of the company’s operation.</p>
<p>“Finally, controlling is important. There should be a controller in the group. This person monitors spending. There are always people who don’t know at all how their money are spent in the company.”</p>
<p><strong>PicCollage: Choosing the right amount of funding</strong></p>
<p>The second lecturer was the co-founder of CardinalBlue. In 2011, their photography app <a href="http://pic-collage.com/">PicCollage</a> was released in 500 Startups accelerator and was downloaded for 400 thousand times in the very first month. “We realized that there weren’t that many competitors. Or, maybe PicCollage is really special.” The co-founder John Fan said that they raised 2.7 million US dollars in the silicon valley, which is a seed funding that is almost enough to be called a Series A.</p>
<p><strong>“ VCs are looking for small restaurants that will become the next Mos Burger. As entrepreneurs, you have to give them the vision, even illusion.”</strong></p>
<p>Raising money is like blowing up a balloon, said John. “If you tell the investors that you are a red balloon, just like Google. They believe you and give you that huge amount of money. And then, BANG! You may explode. But if you just got the right amount of money, you could become a beautiful balloon.”</p>
<p>When it comes to fundraising, John has 3 advice.</p>
<p>1.Most start-ups should not go immediately for VC.</p>
<p>2.Be careful when choosing investors.</p>
<p>3.Try to MAKE MONEY instead of going for fundraising again.</p>
<p>“Many entrepreneurs say that we should be careful about money because maybe we will not get any more in the future. However, the investors may not tell you this. Listening to the investor’s advice, we moved to a new office and did lots of marketing and investment turned out not suitable for us. The investors want there money back. It’s true. But only you know what you should do!”</p>
<p>“There are two kinds of start-ups: unicorns and money makers. While unicorns are relatively rare, please try to earn more money!”</p>
<p><strong>“If you want our money, please figure out first what we are doing.” -Mesh Ventures</strong></p>
<p>“When trying to find investment target, we want groups that jump into bigger industry, at least 1 billion worth. Mesh Ventures invest mostly on American and Asian companies, including areas like Smart City, Industry 4.0, and security-related industries. We care about what problems these systems can solve. Before coming to us, please make sure you have good explanation on the data you collected.”</p>
<p>Ben Liu, co-founder of <a href="http://mesh.vc/">Mesh Ventures</a> says that you can do whatever you want with the money you get. If you are in seed round or A round, you may be still working on prototypes. In series B or C, the business model is clear. You need money to make it big. Some people want to make products. Others prefer branding. It all depends on your company and the industry.</p>
<p>“If there’s a group asking for 50 million dollars and as I walk in their office, I see a gigantic marble structure. I will start to ask myself: are they spending their money on marbles? And I will most likely not spend my money on this company. And finally, can money help you find the right employees? I personally think that smart guys have their own goals. They may not work for you because of those marbles. What you, as the owner of the company, want to do in the future is the key.”</p>', '5e1/012/094/5e1012094fdd4192442570.jpg', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', null, null);

<p>The premier also pointed out that the project is a major part of the administration’s five major innovative industries as well as President Tsai Ing-wen’s election platform.</p>
<p>Attracting elite international talents is key to the development of the Asian Silicon Valley, reiterated Lin, who has instructed the National Development Council (NDC) to formulate plans to attract such talents, take inventory of the difficulties and obstacles faced by foreign nationals working in Taiwan, and improve relevant work environments so that Taoyuan City can realize this goal.</p>
<p>Industry 4.0 is the development orientation for Taiwan’s industries, the premier noted. The administration has selected the Asian Silicon Valley project as Industry 4.0’s ignition in the hope that the world’s most advanced ideas and applications can converge in Taiwan. This would be highly significant for industrial growth and is the chief reason for the administration to promote the Asian Silicon Valley project, Lin said.</p>
<p>Taipei and Hsinchu are the “left and right hands” of Taoyuan City, Lin further pointed out: Taipei is an international metropolis rich in culture and thronged with talents, while Hsinchu, a “city of science and technology,” is a major base for Taiwan’s information and communications technology industries and is linked to many fundamental industries of Industry 4.0. Hence the administration has selected Taoyuan City as the base for carrying out the Asian Silicon Valley project, which will serve as an engine to boost northern Taiwan’s economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Taoyuan City has a sound industrial base and vast hinterland; it is the location of Taiwan’s foremost international airport and the site for the Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project. Most important, many young people are willing to work in Taoyuan City. These favorable conditions have made Taoyuan the most suitable place for promoting the Asian Silicon Valley project, Lin emphasized.</p>
<p>Lin expressed expectations that the Asian Silicon Valley project will become the starting point for changing Taiwan’s future industrial development so that Taoyuan will be transformed into a modern society and a locomotive engine for the island’s economic growth.</p>
<p>The NDC stated that the project will be implemented via four major aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmentally, measures regarding talent recruitment, funding, laws and regulations, and cross-field collaboration will help create a comprehensive innovation ecosystem.</li>
<li>In applications, Taoyuan will serve as a center for experimentation, and research and development for the promotion of smart cities and application of smart services.</li>
<li>Globally, the administration will expand overseas efforts to attract investment while integrating the nation’s networks abroad, linking up with international resources and strengthening international marketing.</li>
<li>In infrastructure, the administration will turn Taoyuan into a base for innovation exchanges and forge links with nationwide innovation resources while attracting global enterprises and outstanding talents.</li>

He called for nationals to throw their support behind social enterprises.</p>
<p>The premier added that he was glad to see 101 social enterprises had already been registered at the social enterprises registration platform.Chang made these remarks at the press conference for a joint exhibition at the Social Enterprise Hub, which is located at the former official residence of the premier on Jinhua Street in Taipei. At the exhibition,Chang studied the products displayed by social enterprises and learned the products’ characteristics by interacting with social-enterprise members. He also tried agricultural products such as dried fruits, pure fermented plum extract and tomato juice.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the exhibition covers a series of activities held May 14-16 by the Taiwan NPO Self-Regulation Alliance. Today’s events encompass the launch ceremony, fair trade fashion show and Taiwan agricultural social enterprise meal- and wine-tasting. In the following days, social enterprise products will be displayed via passive or active exhibitions as well as interactive experiences based on three major themes: food and farming innovations, fair trade and community culture.</p>

In March 2015 the TAF Innovation Base was inaugurated at the former Air Force Command Headquarters.

This base now comprises the Executive Yuan Start-up Hub—established in August 2015 at the garage of the premier’s former residence—and the Social Enterprise Hub.

<p>The cultivation of information software talents is of the utmost importance, Duh pointed out. He tasked the MOE along with the MOEA and MOL to formulate an overall strategy on information technology education. In the short term, the MOE can encourage universities to open cross-field credit courses, while in the medium to long terms it can adjust or increase relevant departments and quotas in order to meet the development needs of industry.</p>

Essentially, social enterprises use innovative approaches to do business for the good of society. Proponents of the social enterprises movement believe that every social issue also represents a business opportunity.</p>

<p>Hence, social enterprises beneficial to Taiwan’s overall social development. The new “changing society through consumption” charity movement has gradually begun replacing NPOs as the leaders of social change.</p>

<p>Taiwan’s social enterprises are on the brink of taking off. More and more entrepreneurs with a sense of social obligation and creative innovation are beginning to invest to make the world a better place.</p>

<h2>Emerging Social Enterprises in Taiwan</h2>

<p>There are approximately 800 social organizations in Taiwan. Of these, about 200 are corporations, and 600 are NPOs.</p>

<p>To support the social enterprises intermediary organizations for promotion, social networking, fundraising, and capacity building have also begun to emerge. Gradually, the social enterprise ecosystem in Taiwan is taking shape.</p>

<h2>Social Enterprise Action Plan</h2>

<p>To promote sustainable innovation and growth and encourage young people to engage in social enterprises, the Executive Yuan set up the Social Enterprise Action Plan in 2014.</p>

<p>The vision of the plan is to create an ecosystem that nurtures innovation, start-up businesses, growth, and the development of social enterprises in Taiwan.</p>

<p>This will be achieve in four ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deregulation: To create a friendly legal environment for social enterprises.</li>
	<li>Networking: To promote and build a social networking platform for different groups of social enterprises at home and abroad.</li>
	<li>Financing: To provide multiple channels of funding through angels, VCs, credit guarantees, etc.</li>
	<li>Incubation: To build an incubation mechanism for social enterprises and establish a professional support system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Enterprise Cluster</h2>

<p>Because social enterprises need a base of operations in Taiwan, with the support of Premier Mao, the Premier’s former residence was officially launched to be used as the base for social entrepreneurs in May, 2015. The main reasons for using this space are as following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It can promote the concept of and raise public awareness for social enterprises, as well as act as the core networking center for social enterprises.</li>
	<li>The facilities include multi-purpose workspaces, conference rooms, exhibition halls, and markets; the government can also use it as the base to promote youth start-up companies and social innovation.</li>
	<li>The expertise of social entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, social movement activists, social workers, programmers, and designers can be pooled together here to build a social enterprise platform, serving as a reference guide for future social enterprise developmental policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Enterprise Hackathon</h2>

<p>The Hackathon for Social Enterprise Clusters was held on March 28th and 29th, 2015. Social entrepreneurs, startup founders, and experts in the field were invited to join the discussions and &nbsp;&nbsp;co-found solutions in accordance with the themes of “exploring the needs and challenges of social enterprises”, and “social enterprise community clusters.”</p>

<h2>Social Enterprise Meet-up</h2>

<p>The purpose of these meetings is to support the regional communities of social entrepreneurs, investors, campuses, and incubators, to hold conferences, seminars, and workshops, to spread the idea of social innovation, and to encourage more people to participate in social enterprises.</p>

<h2>Social Enterprise Registration</h2>

<p>In order to increase the transparency of social enterprise development, the government is going to assist the private sector set up a registration system for social enterprises utilizing a two-stage verification process (basic and advanced, which may include charity reports and financial reports). The companies that meet the qualifications for the advanced system can also acquire additional support such as mentoring, funding, incubation services, and government procurements.</p>

<h2>International Connections</h2>

<p>So there is a lot happening with social enterprises in Taiwan and the International connections are growing. One old-timer in the social enterprise business is London-based The Big Issue which was founded in 1991 and arrived in Taiwan in 2010. The Big Issue give homeless people the chance to earn a legitimate income by selling their eponymous magazine. They believe in “help them to help themselves” and “selling, not begging”.</p>

<p>Yoder and Wilson likely approve saying that “Innovation leadership skills are key tools that can enable anyone, no matter how poor, to take control of their lives and build a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.”</p>

<p>Imagine achieving all that as a sustainable, on-going social enterprise in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Due to globalization and the development of the knowledge economy, attracting international talent is a crucial competitive advantage. In recent years, Taiwan has faced increased competition for talent which has made it hard for companies to attract top talent.</p>

<p>Starting from 2015, the working population in Taiwan will decline by an average of 180,000 people per year making the need to recruit and retain more foreigners a national necessity.</p>

<p>To attract and retain outstanding executive talent to help Taiwan’s economy transform and become more innovative and thus boost domestic employment, Premier Mao instructed the creation of the Executive Yuan Talent Competiveness Strategy Promotion Group.</p>

<p><strong>They have four main strategies to attracting global talent:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Establishing a talent recruitment joint service center called Contact Taiwan</li>
	<li>Establishing an integrated overseas talent recruitment network</li>
	<li>Raising Taiwan’s talent competitiveness conditions</li>
	<li>Building a friendly environment for retaining talent</li>
</ol>

<p>Contact Taiwan was established on August 7 this year. Case managers will provide global talent matching employment services, help newly arrived employees with pre-arrival assessment, entry application and introduction to life in Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Contact Taiwan website which will go live in December, will provide interactive matching services to attract global talent and provide life and work problem advice.</p>

<p><strong>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has selected 10 areas to concentrate recruiting:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Industry 4.0</li>
	<li>Smarter systems integrated applications including: Big data/ Internet of Things/ cloud services</li>
	<li>Biotechnology</li>
	<li>Renewable energy</li>
	<li>5G &amp; forward-looking communication technology</li>
	<li>High-level manufacturing equipment</li>
	<li>Advanced electronic parts and components manufacturing (including IC design and semiconductors)</li>
	<li>Product and user experience design</li>
	<li>Creative forward-looking research and development</li>
	<li>Global financial services.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Contact Taiwan Center has visited companies in various key industries to learn who they need to recruit and what salaries and benefits they can be provide.</p>

<p><strong>How to apply</strong></p>

<p>The Contact Taiwan case managers are working under the umbrella of the Invest Taiwan organization. So if you are&nbsp;a Taiwanese company looking to recruit&nbsp;foreigners or if you are a foreigner looking for a job in Taiwan, call them at</p>

<p>Apparently, Taiwan “wants to do more,” to use Chris Heivly’s words. He’s the VP Innovation in the Techstars Startup Ecosystem Team and an experienced startup builder. He believes behind the ambition is the realization of “the gap between where the ecosystem is today and probably where it should be.”</p>

<p>As it matches the Techstars’ desire to expand its operations and grow footprint in Asia, the idea to collaborate with TTA has in fact been kindled a year ago. The program, different from the seed accelerator that the organization has been known for, focuses on strengthening the infrastructure of the entire startup ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote>

	<p>Read more: <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45836" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45836">Techstars, Qualcomm, and Taiwan Tech Arena launch program to build international innovation ecosystem in Taiwan</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With multiple tools — including Startup Weekend, Hackathon, and one-on-one meetings — in hand, Techstars aims to develop a fully fledged ecosystem for founders and entrepreneurs in Taiwan, the first spot in Asia where all the tools will be leveraged.</p>

<p><strong>Techstars will deploy these ecosystem-building tools, as in any other countries, based on a bottom-up approach. “We work with founders first and learn how to support founders,” Mr. Heivly said. “There’s an idea and a roadmap, but there isn’t a specific ‘do A, then B, then C, and then D.’” The program isn’t led by a single authority like the government.</strong></p>

<p>Counterintuitive as it may seem to many, he said it’s the best way to build a startup community, as opposed to how the older generation comes to their success, that is, through mastering the idea of hierarchy and structure.</p>

<p>There seems to be no plan, but the direction is clear: to bind together all the actors in the ecosystem with a “founder-centric” attitude. They all can have a role to play in this program if they wish to create meaningful connections with startups and make them stronger, said Mr. Heivly.</p>

<p>His team seeks to facilitate engagement with universities, corporates (e.g., Qualcomm), and government (e.g., MOST and TTA) and pull them closer to the startup community through events and meetups.</p>

<p>Mr. Heivly took corporates for instance. As in most countries, they aren’t yet well connected with the startup community in Taiwan. But there’s great potential for them to collaborate with startups: they can help startups better understand a market and startups can help them drive internal innovation.</p>

<p>While his team’s impact cannot be quantifiably measured, the connectivity they create can be. An indicator may be, for instance, the number of people connected through events.</p>

<p>Instead of following the traditional framework in which an ecosystem is measured by how many jobs it creates or how much capital it deploys, they focus on understanding how the network is formed so as to learn how and why those numbers are achieved. This, he believes, will be the “foundational work” that helps the ecosystem grow better.</p>

<p>With its high-tech pedigree and large base of potential founders, the startup ecosystem in Taiwan can be even more vibrant, said Mr. Heivly.</p>

<p>Based on his observation and research, half of 1% of every given population are high-growth entrepreneurs, but there probably aren’t 115 thousand of them yet in Taiwan. “I want to bring them out,” he said.</p>

<p>While people tend to “culturally sit on the sidelines,” he believes they’re indeed pre-wired to start their venture — after all, he said, western thinking is embraced here. “I just need to nudge them a little bit.”</p>

In his speech, Kneron’s CEO and Taiwanese native, Dr. Albert Liu, PhD, detailed his vision of the Edge AI Net made possible through their unique reconfigurable technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edgeaisummit.com/events/edge-ai-summit-2019" title="https://www.edgeaisummit.com/events/edge-ai-summit-2019">The Edge AI Summit</a> is in its second year and brings together venture capitalists, industry press and analysts, and edge AI companies to foster dialogue and spur growth between vested parties in this growing segment within the AI industry. Even with speeches from the likes of Google, BMW, Microsoft, Facebook and NVIDIA, Dr. Liu’s stood out for its focus on the vision that Kneron has for the future of Edge AI.</p>

<p>More Wall-E than Skynet, Kneron’s vision is to build an Edge AI Net that allows intelligent devices to be able to infer and communicate with each other without going through a centralized AI brain, usually found in the cloud. In effect, this would democratize AI inferencing and distribute its power away from a centralized brain.</p>

<p>The key to realizing this vision is Kneron’s reconfigurable technology. Due to the way it’s built, Kneron’s Neural Processing Unit (NPU) technology is able to not only switch between audio, voice, and 2D/3D vision recognition in near real-time, but can also adapt to all major AI frameworks and CNN models in the market.</p>

<p>This allows Kneron’s hardware and software solutions to enable any device with the ability to communicate and make actionable decisions based on changing conditions regardless of AI framework and without going to a central cloud-based brain. Latency is significantly reduced while security and privacy are improved.</p>

<p>Dr. Albert Liu stated, “It was exciting to open eyes and ears at the Summit when we shared our vision of the Edge AI Net, and that there are already products in the market from major brands that are powered by Kneron edge AI solutions.”</p>

<p>The future looks bright for Kneron as they pioneer the way forward for the Edge AI Net. If they succeed, our future will have more Wall-E’s and less Skynets.</p>

This is made possible partially by around 700 thousand migrant workers, mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. With a dream of various kind in mind, they pluck up the courage to cross the sea and move to Taiwan to work as fishermen, caregivers, or servants, some thousand miles away from their family and native land.</p><p>Five years ago when <a href="https://one-forty.org/" title="https://one-forty.org/">One Forty</a> was founded, one could spot one migrant worker out of forty people in Taiwan. It should be even easier now as the number of blue-collar workers from Southeast Asia increases by more than 10% every year.</p><p>Due to language and cultural barriers, they often find it difficult to communicate with their employers, make new friends, and integrate into the new society. Deeply-rooted stereotypes against them only render their living situation even more precarious.</p><p>Also, not given any opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge at the workplace, they can struggle finding a better job after returning to their home country, and thus be forced to do unskilled, physical work again to earn a living.</p><p>&ldquo;We are the first non-profit organization in Taiwan to empower these workers with education,&rdquo; said Kevin Chen, co-founder of One Forty, who leads his team to run a weekend school in order to help the fast-growing minority population adapt to the new environment and improve their own lives. There, they offer not only language training programs but courses on Taiwanese culture.</p><p>With language skills, these migrant workers may find better-paid jobs after returning to their hometown, Mr. Chen told us about what he has learned from some workers who later work for Taiwanese companies that have set up a branch in Indonesia.</p><p>At the school, One Forty also offers financial planning and business management lessons to help foreign workers break out of the vicious cycle of poverty with new knowledge. They&rsquo;re therefore able to, for example, start their own business in their home countries.</p><figure><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/d7b/b31/b0b/d7bb31b0bb4afc72caf821e5009af7c0883304b5.png" style="width: 800px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></figcaption><figcaption style="text-align: center;">One Forty&rsquo;s language class / Photograph:One Forty</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;During the interviews with our students, we realize there are still a lot of unsolved issues,&rdquo; Mr Chen said. Recently, they found out that many workers can&rsquo;t make it to their offline courses on weekends. His team then started to teach language courses on Youtube and offer free self-learning materials so that the workers can study Mandarin on their own in their free time.</p><p>Mr. Chen described the startup journey to be a series of &ldquo;trial and error,&rdquo; that is, repeated and varied attempts to solve newly discovered problems until success. &ldquo;This is also why I think we are still a startup team,&rdquo; he said.</p><h2>New opportunities</h2><p>Starting from this year, One Forty has been working with a number of privately held companies, including Far EasTone Telecom, who sponsors the project of sending self-learning materials to migrant workers across Taiwan.</p><p>Mr. Chen believes for the organization, there&rsquo;s more room for collaboration with enterprises, who have started to pay attention to this large group of immigrants. &ldquo;Some of them would like to fulfill their social responsibilities as private companies by financing us,&rdquo; he said. Indeed, this attempt can also create a positive brand image for enterprises if they plan to expand to Southeast Asia.</p><p>For companies currently operating in the region, there can&rsquo;t be a better talent pool other than One Forty&rsquo;s school, in which the students are all local people who have learned to interact naturally with the Taiwanese. &ldquo;There are already five of our students working for one Taiwanese company in Indonesia,&rdquo; said Mr. Chen. They earn double to triple the amount that they might otherwise be given to do the same job and have therefore substantially improved the quality of life.</p><p>It seems that everything One Forty does pertains to bridging the gap between Taiwan and Southeast Asia, especially the countries which their students call home. Following the same goal, the organization has started this year to conduct training sessions for migrant workers in Taiwan-based companies as well.</p><p>When it comes to social impact, Mr. Chen said One Forty tries to measure it during the two trips every year to Indonesia and the Philippines, the two main sources of migrant workers in Taiwan. &ldquo;We visit our former students, go to the shops they open or the places where they work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But since we live far from them and aren&rsquo;t able to do it often, we are hoping to work with local non-profit organizations to keep fully informed of any news in their lives.&rdquo;</p><figure><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: 800px;"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/649/0fd/0f4/6490fd0f42535ea8b7dcfee24b9f37bf3a45721c.png" style="width: 800px;"><span class="fr-inner"><br></span></span></span>One Forty visiting Indonesia / Photograph: One Forty</figcaption></figure><p>Mr. Chen believes from a broader perspective, what they&rsquo;ve been doing also helps Taiwan shape better relations with foreign countries, a particularly crucial task for the politically isolated nation. Acting as a citizen diplomat, One Forty support migrant workers to facilitate intercultural understanding and ensure they have a positive experience in Taiwan, which, in the long run, may benefit the country.</p><p>Last year, he shared with a number of like-minded organizations from around the world at International Labor Conference (ILO Conference) how One Forty empowers migrant workers with knowledge and practical skills. &ldquo;A lot of them are surprised to know there&rsquo;s an organization like us in Taiwan working on how to support migrants,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>In fact, social issues stemming from immigration are universal. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s also refugee crisis in Europe, for example,&rdquo; Mr. Chen said. They require every member in the global community to combine forces to come up with innovative solutions.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br><a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45915">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45915</a></p>', '5e1/2f5/5fd/5e12f55fd2b18730993391.jpg', 1, '2020-01-06 08:53:29', '2024-09-01 22:10:18', null);

It estimates the figure of 2019 may hit $8M (NT$240M).</p><p>Founded in 2015, Hahow encourages the skilled to pass their knowledge to those who are eager to learn something new and useful, ranging from programming, financial planning, to painting. The teachers raise funds from a crowd of students before they build the content of their courses, which later usually turn into part of the &ldquo;long tail&rdquo; that brings continuous flow of revenue to the site. Meanwhile, the quality of these online courses is constantly optimized as the students provide real-time feedback for the teachers over the online platform.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;We help teachers sell their knowledge to customers and places they can&rsquo;t reach themselves,&rdquo; Co-founder Arnold Chiang said. &ldquo;This is how Hahow differentiates itself from competitors.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>These words seem to have defined the next steps for the startup company, who has just welcomed a new capital. For one thing, it has started to serve enterprises with its newly-launched sub-site Hahow for Business, whose content includes selected training courses for employees on topics such as presentation skills, data analysis, logical thinking, and so on.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/a82/4e6/269/a824e62697c743105b195c0ce479fc14b0102b9c.png" style="width: 577px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><figure><figcaption style="text-align: center;">Hahow for Business / Photograph : Hahow</figcaption></figure><p>&ldquo;We hope enterprises buy a library for their employees rather than locking them in a classroom,&rdquo; Mr. Chiang said.</p><p>Instead of having students sit and watch videos, Hahow offers customized experience for an online environment.

But the moment the company started to think seriously about tapping into this new market is when they discovered there have been 6,000 business customers on its site.</p><p>In fact, Hahow has offered some preliminary courses to a bank, hospital, and the Tourism Bureau in 2018 and to ten enterprises last year to test the water.</p><p>While &ldquo;companies spend a lot on staff training,&rdquo; Mr. Chiang and his team appear to be quite optimistic about the new service. &ldquo;The calls simply never stop,&rdquo; he said.</p><h2>Going global</h2><p>For another, it has been gearing up for overseas expansion as the site earns 15% of the traffic from Chinese-speaking users across the world.</p><p>With a Malaysian subsidiary, Hahow has been struggling to find its place in the competitive market of China, where each content provider enjoys dominance in a course category. &ldquo;By comparison, we are a site that offers &lsquo;everything,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Chiang described. &ldquo;Therefore, we really need to be clear about whom to authorize the access to each type of our courses.&rdquo;</p><p>As the first step, Hahow has signed a contract with streaming giant Iqiyi, but launching online courses on a Chinese site isn&rsquo;t easy task. They not only need to rewrite all the subtitles and marketing content but deal with the strict Internet policy that makes video transmission unnecessarily difficult. Mr. Chiang said his team is still trying to find a solution to these issues.</p><p>In the future, the startup company seeks to work with foreign teachers, for example, in Japan. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of content that&rsquo;s worth digitalizing such of the knowledge from artisans and craftsmen (shokunin),&rdquo; Mr. Chiang said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the world would want to pay to learn.&rdquo; The long-term plan will expand its base of teachers, enabling the company to scale up.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Startup @ TW〕<br><a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45910">https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45910</a></p>', '5e1/2f6/648/5e12f66489166827616602.jpg', 1, '2020-01-06 08:57:39', '2024-09-01 22:09:37', null);

<p>Hacking House is a global IoT training and entrepreneurship mentoring program launched by French IoT unicorn Sigfox as an effort to address real life problems with innovative prototypes and solutions.</p>

<p>The Taipei Season 2, the fifth batch across the globe after that in San Francisco, Taipei, Paris, and Chicago (in order), attracted over 100 applications from around the world. A total of 25 applicants, mostly students, were eventually selected and assigned to four teams to solve different issues in three months with the Sigfox 0G network, a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) interconnecting low-bandwidth, battery powered devices with low bit rates over long ranges.</p>

<p><strong>The first place goes to eCap, a team developing a bluetooth-enabled wearable to improve safety at construction sites. With devices connected to a bluetooth transmitter, the system control center is able to respond spontaneously to any accidents, determining where they happen and carrying out rescues accordingly.</strong></p>

<p>Following eCap is Factum, a team innovating the logistics industry with its method to sense when a container is unsealed during transportation and thus improve the transparency in shipping.</p>

<p>Pay X comes up with a system that allows mail carrier to track when a letter is dropped into the post boxes within their district; it not only keeps them from checking empty ones but optimizes their route for mail collection.</p>

<p>Seeing the production of coffee beans in Central America threatened by outbreaks of coffee leaf rust, Coffeeye develops an early detection system that prevents the destructive fungus from spreading throughout the fields.</p>

<p>The audience included foreign government officials and scholars from technical universities such as NCTU (National Chiao-Tung University) and NTUST (National Taiwan University of Science of Technology).</p>

<p>“It’s incredible to have such a supportive ecosystem here where government agencies, academics and the industry work together to create such an unique program in Taiwan, and conducive for foreign talent looking for vocational and entrepreneurial path,” said Philippe Chiu, CTO and co-founder of UnaBiz. He described the program as a “launchpad for ‘Technopreneurs’ who wish to launch IoT startups in Taiwan.”</p>

<p>Neil Chuang, Marketing Manager at STMicroelectronics, said: “The Hacking House Taipei Season 2 took place in a very important period for the global Sigfox ecosystem, as the new generation of the Sigfox semiconductor solution, called Monarch, is now available for IoT devices that can roam in any of the 67 countries where the Sigfox network is currently deployed."</p>

<p>“We are pleased to see the growing ecosystem around our first Hacking House\'s franchise managed by UnaBiz with leaders in their area such as STMicroelectronics, Trisco, Might Electronic or IAPS of NCTU,” said Maxime Schacht, Head of Hacking House program. “In just a few years the Hacking House has proven to be one of the world\'s leading IoT incubation programs. The results of this new batch in Taipei prove once again the talent and agility shown by the participants in solving complex business problems in a short period of time.”</p>

<p>In a similar vein, local cold wallet maker&nbsp;<a href="https://coolbitx.com/" title="https://coolbitx.com/">CoolBitX</a> recently developed Synga Bridge, a messaging-based KYC/AML solution that is now being used by Japan-based VC Trade, a crypto exchanged owned by SBI Holdings.</p>

<p>Along the theme of solving real-world pain points, DeFi has seemingly become the most pervasive use case, and rightly so. Existing financial systems are plagued with inefficient legacy systems that centralize data storage and authority, in turn passing on greater levies to increasingly privacy-concerned citizens. DeFi offers to provide a more transparent and secure means of accessing, lending, and transferring wealth.</p>

<p>The total value of DeFi projects has nearly tripled this year to over US$650 million. Although the conversations are largely dominated by opinions and analysis of MakerDAO and its stablecoin Dai, there are many upcoming projects fueling the DeFi movement. Here in Taiwan, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://easydai.app/overview" title="https://easydai.app/overview">EasyDai</a> is a decentralized exchange and lending platform that enables users to earn high-yield interest on Dai via Ethereum deposits.&nbsp;<a href="https://steaker.com/" title="https://steaker.com/">Steaker</a> on the other hand is a digital asset management platform that helps users invest in notable DeFi projects.</p>

<h2>Working on the rails</h2>

<p>In terms of development under the hood, it’s clear there is still much to be done when it comes to the widespread implementation of blockchain technology—engineering teams are still grappling with solving usability, interoperability, security, scalability, just to name a few challenges. But there’s also been a lot of progress made in these areas. Layer 2 solutions such as Plasma and Optimistic Rollup have demonstrated promising results when it comes to increasing transaction throughput and the amount of datasets that protocols like Ethereum can handle. Advancements in foundational technologies like zero knowledge proofs may finally help corporates assimilate into an increasingly privacy sensitive world. Needless to say, it’s still early days of blockchain development, and it’s anyone’s game.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, some may remember the dramatic dissolution of COBINHOOD and its associated protocol initiative DEXON earlier this year, where after a series of shareholder disputes all one hundred of its staff were ultimately let go. Although a major blow to the local ecosystem, their efforts on building an infinitely scalable and more secure public chain have not gone to waste.</p>

<p>The company’s co-founder and CTO Wei-Ning Huang has picked up the reins and began a project of his own dubbed&nbsp;<a href="https://tangerine-network.io/en/" title="https://tangerine-network.io/en/">Tangerine Network</a>, which incorporates many of the same core components from DEXON’s open source code.</p>

<p>Also rising from the ashes of COBINHOOD’s demise are a legion of experienced blockchain developers, many of whom are now pursuing their own founder dreams. Lee Hsuan and Edwin Yeh, the company’s former heads of engineering and business strategy respectively, established&nbsp;<a href="https://portto.io/" title="https://portto.io/">portto</a> (AW#19), a startup focused on bringing blockchain usage to the masses through its seamless dApp browser Blocto.</p>

<h2>Guiding the way</h2>

<p>Facebook made headlines in 2019 with the announcement of Libra, a stable coin meant to establish a frictionless, global payments network. The original consortium consisted of 28 founding members, but five, including Visa and Mastercard, have since dropped out due to the torrent of scrutiny from regulators and policy makers alike.</p>

<p>Regulatory uncertainty and the associated legal ramifications have been the primary inhibitors of blockchain’s adoption. Different markets have embraced the technology to varying degrees, but Asia has arguably been a front runner in this area. Countries like Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have all delineated clear and definite guidelines on how blockchain companies should work and operate, some perhaps more conservative than others.</p>

<p>At the moment, startups in Taiwan are able to raise up to NT$30 million (US$1M) via STOs, and only from accredited investors with a cap of NT$100,000 per person. On the other hand, in Singapore, regulatory oversight only kicks in if an STO exceeds SG$5 million (US$3.7M) and caters to more than 50 investors or any number of non-accredited ones.
	<br>While limiting in some respects, these regulations at the very least clearly stipulate the rules of the game, equipping founders with peace of mind when it comes to planning their long-term operational roadmaps.</p>

<h2>The march goes on</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, blockchain is now a decade in the running. It’s been 10 years since the release of Satoshi’s whitepaper, and in this time alone, we’ve already gone through one major hype cycle, effectively catapulting the terms “bitcoin,” “crypto,” and “blockchain” from developer circles to front page news, and back again.</p>

<p>Last year’s crash likely confirmed the suspicions of many skeptical onlookers. But recent advancements in the underlying technology, uptick in adoption, and growing commercial implementations are surely driving some decision-makers to develop a more loving embrace. China’s regulators and its president Xi Jinping, for example, went from a hardened, outright ban to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-bitcoin.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-bitcoin.html">endorsement</a> of blockchain technology while announcing intentions to develop a state-backed digital currency.</p>

<p>For Taiwan, stakeholders are proceeding with cautious optimism. The private-public blockchain alliance created by the National Development Council (NDC) last June recently outlined a plan to explore the implementation of blockchain in five major areas: public services, finance/insurance, energy, healthcare, and agriculture.</p>

<p>Investors are also getting more savvy, no longer immediately jumping into the feeding frenzy of token sales but carefully prospecting the use of both traditional and non-traditional financial instruments when determining how to best support founders. And the community itself has maintained, if not gained in momentum, as demonstrated by the recent <a href="https://abasummit.io/" title="https://abasummit.io/">Asia Blockchain Summit</a> (now second year in the running) which ultimately brought out over 4,000 participants and 135 speakers.</p>

<p>Whether it’s in terms of technical development, regulatory frameworks, or community activism, Taiwan’s blockchain industry has made steadfast progress in the second half of 2019, catering to both local and international founders alike. We’re also starting to see early instances of the ecosystem maturing, with more and more blockchain founders branching out and interacting with traditional industries, while also, perhaps more importantly, setting longer term goals and ambitions.</p>

<p>Based in Israel, HYPE Sports Innovation is a global network of accelerators focusing on sports innovation. With firm support from the sports administration of the Ministry of Education, it kicked off the first accelerator program in Taiwan and Asia, following the 2017 Summer Universiade in Taipei, and has been working with IAPS (Center of Industry Accelerator and Patent Strategy), a local startup accelerator owned by National Chiao-Tung University, to execute it ever since.</p>

<p>Zvika Popper, COO of HYPE, told Business Next that before bringing their accelerator to the island, his team had been considering expanding to Asia, which he described as a “relatively new market” for sports tech companies. It hoped to set up a new base in a country where sports tech is at its early stage of development — to pick the “low-hanging fruit.”</p>

<p>Taiwan emerged to be one of the best options. With abundant resources for startups and high-quality talent, it’s an ideal location for HYPE to launch its first Asian accelerator and expand its regional network — possibly to Southeast Asia, an area with which Taiwan has strong connection, said Mr. Popper.</p>

<p>Thanks to the business culture in Taiwan, which is relatively similar to that in the Western world, the process has been painless, according to Mr. Popper. He also gave credit to IAPS for the well-executed project, saying that they’re the most committed partner among all in their ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Meet the startups</h2>

<p>Selected from over 150 applicants, the 13 teams in this batch had participated in a three-month training program created by HYPE later last year. It was concluded with the demo day, in which they were given the opportunity to pitch to a jury of industry experts and investors.</p>

<p>The results of the competition were revealed on the same day: DP Smart Technology (Taiwan) and Footbot (Russia) won themselves a booth in HYPE’s signature startup exhibition, and Stryde (Hong Kong) and Red Dot Drone (Japan) a place in IAPS’s accelerator program.</p>

<p>It’s a batch with the most diversity among the three it has recruited for the past one year, said the organizing team. More than half of the cohort hails from a foreign country. Below is the complete list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>DP Smart Technology (Taiwan): panoramic camera named Rogy capable of capturing immersive content.</li>
	<li>Pickups (Taiwan): social app that matches amateur basketball players.</li>
	<li>Strike (Taiwan): IoT-powered, small baseball to help players improve their performance and techniques.</li>
	<li>Quick hitter (Taiwan): AI-powered system that optimizes how basketball players shoot.</li>
	<li>Whiizu (Taiwan): indoor training system for professional cyclists.</li>
	<li>Deepunch (Taiwan): lightweight massge gun that relieves muscle pains.</li>
	<li>Fanlytiks (India): one-stop plaform that analyzes fan behaviors on social media and provides insights for sports clubs and brands.</li>
	<li>Gameconomy (Malaysia): virtual trading platform for game developers.</li>
	<li>Komodo Monitr (New Zealand): athlete development platform for coaches working with amateur athletes.</li>
	<li>Stryde (Hong Kong): gamified fitness platform that stimulates users to reach their goals via betting.</li>
	<li>Footbot (Russia): robotic training system for football players, amateur or professional.</li>
	<li>Red Dot Drone (Japan): automatic aerial filming technology for sports events.</li>
	<li>Freelates (Israel): Pilates training program that activates unused spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>As more and more international startups come to Taiwan to join the program, this one-year-old accelerator expects to grow its presence globally.</p>

<p>The two-year-old company is known for its app that allows users to plan their cycling routes and enjoy rides with a group of friends while keeping track of where they are and how fast they ride at any moment. It also serves as a market where users can find cycling events they may be interested or create their own ones.</p>

<p>Also, the company offers a platform called Velodash Staff for event organizers to manage their events more efficiently. In 2018, it was picked by the Singapore government as the official app to record the performance of the participants in a cycling event on the National Day.</p>

<p><strong>With the new capital, Velodash will be able to optimize these two products by expanding its software team and promote its services to Japan and other Asian markets.</strong></p>

<p>“We believe that Velodash’s products have a huge potential in Japan,” said Taiki Sekiguchi, Executive Assistant of CEO at NIPPON Platform Group. “They may upgrade the sports industry and push forward the burgeoning placemaking projects here.” Indeed, Velodash’s app was used in Japan not long ago, in Green Tour Kyoto, a cycling event that aims to revive the old town with a new form of tourism.</p>

<p>It’s the Japanese firm’s first attempt to invest in a Taiwanese startup. But surprisingly, Molly Huang, one of the co-founders of Velodash, said the deal was clinched soon after they approached the founder of the group, Jun Takagi. “He told me he saw a team that is highly motivated and competent,” she said.</p>

<p>So far, the service that the team provides has been a boon to a number of cycling events across Asia, and they plan to boost many other outdoor activities in the future.</p>

This year, in celebration of its 30-year presence in Taiwan, Microsoft opened an AI R&amp;D center in Taipei. Other notable technology giants such as Google and NVIDIA have also made plans to establish AI R&amp;D centers in Taiwan. To meet this rising demand in AI talents, the Taiwanese government announced this year that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2019/05/26/taiwan-will-train-10000-ai-workers-per-year-for-google-microsoft-and-more-to-meet-rising-demand/" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2019/05/26/taiwan-will-train-10000-ai-workers-per-year-for-google-microsoft-and-more-to-meet-rising-demand/">10,000 AI engineers will be trained</a>. While this sounds remarkable, given that only an estimated 2<a href="https://jfgagne.ai/talent/" title="https://jfgagne.ai/talent/">2,000 people in the world are expert enough to initiate world-class AI projects on their own</a>, as a leader in AI talent within Greater Southeast Asia (GSEA = ASEAN + Taiwan), Taiwan is already a hub for GSEA-based companies to build their tech teams.</p>

<p>Alongside the world’s giants, more and more startups in Southeast Asia have come to Taiwan to recruit talents. From Singapore, we have startups like Carousell, and Shopback, which was part of AppWorks Accelerator #13 (AW#13), setting up their R&amp;D teams in Taiwan. As Taiwan continues to churn out top talent, the new push by <a href="https://ai.taiwan.gov.tw/news/cabinet-plans-to-develop-the-nations-ai-industry/" title="https://ai.taiwan.gov.tw/news/cabinet-plans-to-develop-the-nations-ai-industry/">the government to sponsor a culture of AI development</a>, and private companies to develop their AI teams here, founders in GSEA can start to consider Taiwan as a launchpad to catalyse their efforts at regional expansion.</p>

<p>In AppWorks Accelerator’s semi-annual update of Taiwan’s AI Ecosystem Map, we found that in the past six months, a number of regulatory frameworks have been implemented to support the growing innovation in the field of AI and more startups and AI ecosystem builders are increasing in Taiwan. The following verticals have made significant strides in the development of AI:</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1580352914727.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-01/img-1579680209-45858@900.jpg 900w" title="AI-Map-19H2" data-result="success" style="width: 900px;"><span class="fr-inner"><figcaption>AI-Map-19H2 / Photograph : AppWorks</figcaption></span></span></span>

<h2>With Advertising Gaining Ground in AI, We See a Rise in Video Marketing, Customer Relationship Management, and Remarketing</h2>

<p>As Facebook’s algorithm continues to change and we’ve witnessed an explosion in data and information, it has become increasingly difficult to reach consumers with limited budgets and digital advertising spend. Companies are beginning to manage relationships with consumers through a variety of AI-driven strategies and digital tools, such as remarketing, to retain their most loyal customers. The push to provide increasingly fragmented customer audiences, and distracted loyalists with personalized experiences and products, has opened up more business opportunities for AI startups to provide marketing solutions.</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, <a href="https://ikala.tv/" title="https://ikala.tv/">iKala</a>, an online karaoke and live broadcasting platform, has transformed into a human-centered AI marketing technology company after 8 years. It is the largest partner of Google Cloud in Asia-Pacific and of Facebook for global marketing, and it is currently covering markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. They also announced the completion of their Series A round of US$ 5M early last year. Judging from the services provided by iKala, we can see that there is a rise in audiovisual marketing, influencer marketing, and results-oriented advertising solutions (also known as “performance marketing”).</p>

<p>Other startups, such as <a href="https://www.omnichat.my/" title="https://www.omnichat.my/">Omnichat</a> -- formerly called Easychat -- and <a href="https://www.rosetta.ai/" title="https://www.rosetta.ai/">Rosetta.ai</a>, both AW#16 startups, are focused on providing brand remarketing services. Instead of traditional chatbot services and other communications methods, they help small-and-medium businesses as well as enterprises use an AI model to accurately target customers to create a win-win situation for both their clients and their clients’ consumers.</p>

<h2>Piggybacking on the Strength of Hardware in Taiwan, Security Monitoring and Smart Home Applications Are Accelerating</h2>

<p>Taiwan has world-class hardware and supply chain management, and coupled with the improvement of camera manufacturing infrastructure, we can see that in regards to AI applications there have been several achievements in security monitoring and smart home appliances.</p>

<p>By combining AI technology with security monitoring, enterprises can greatly reduce the waste of manpower and avoid human error, thereby improving the quality and safety of monitoring solutions, which they deem to be one of their most important verticals. In addition to AW#9 startup <a href="https://umbocv.ai/" title="https://umbocv.ai/">Umbo CV</a>, which has successfully entered the European and North American markets, there is also AW#19 startup <a href="https://www.beseye.com/us/home" title="https://www.beseye.com/us/home">Beseye</a>, founded in 2014. It introduced its AI computer vision solution as the human safety backbone of Japan’s Tokyu Railway. When the camera detects that someone has entered a dangerous section of track, the system will automatically notify the central control center or the station’s staff to deal with it immediately and reduce railroad crossing accidents. Beseye currently has over 2,000 corporate clients, including Chunghwa Telecom and other large enterprises. Other startups like <a href="https://www.ionetworks.co/" title="https://www.ionetworks.co/">ioNetworks</a> and <a href="https://www.cycarrier.com/" title="https://www.cycarrier.com/">CyCarrier</a> are also focused on providing related security monitoring services.</p>

<p>As modern-day working people continue to lead busy lives, there is a gradual emergence of home applications and smart home appliances that make it easier for users to care for elders, their children, and their pets. AW#10 startup <a href="https://www.nuwarobotics.com/" title="https://www.nuwarobotics.com/">NUWA Robotics</a> launched the first generation of their companion robots called “Keibi” in 2018. They specialize in STEAM education, theater-style English learning, and sensory interactive education. Their robots are focused on education and can also be a smart home helper. After selling over 5,000 units, they recently launched the second generation of their companion robots called “Kebbi Air” on a crowdfunding platform. They were able to raise NT $1M within half an hour of launching. Other notable startups in this space include Aeolus , which is focused on elderly care, AW#16 startup <a href="https://cubo.network/" title="https://cubo.network/">Cubo</a> which is focused on developing smart baby cameras, and <a href="https://shopus.furbo.com/" title="https://shopus.furbo.com/">Furbo</a>,which is focused on smart pet care services.</p>

<h2>AI Ecosystem Builders: Sandbox Trends, R&amp;D, and Accelerators</h2>

<p>With the developments in AI, machine learning, and big data trends, certain legal topics are widely discussed such as copyrights and intellectual property, legal liabilities, and the impact on the existing regulatory regime in Taiwan. Two laws have been passed in 2018 to tackle these new trends: the Financial Technology Development and Innovative Experimentation Act for a fintech regulatory sandbox and the Unmanned Vehicle Technology Innovation and Experiment Act for autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>Due to the high degree of regulation, the use of AI in financial services is slower than other industries, but given the advantage of having large amounts of data and complete customer information, the potential business opportunities are at an all-time high. The Legislative Yuan for Taiwan has been hosting a regulatory sandbox for companies to experiment with new business models that currently don’t have a legal framework. So far, 11 applications for experimentation or testing of new forms of fintech have been filed since the sandbox was launched. Many fintech startups have also started to cooperate with large-scale financial companies. Instead of starting from the perspective of replacing the existing financial industry, they are able to create a win-win situation and reduce the anxiety of current financial players in the industry. For example, hiHedge and Fubon jointly launched the Fubon hiHedge AI Chip Strategy, which uses AI technology to calculate the chip flow of Taiwan’s daily listed stocks to provide consumers with more complete information. Other new ventures like Adenovo are focused on providing real-time smart financial solutions for financial institutions and enterprises, and have received investment from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund and Zhaofeng VC.</p>

<p>As for the law passed to promote the usage of autonomous vehicles, it is considered one that may provide a more friendly environment for testing the application of AI and IoT technology in transportation. Taiwan will be well-positioned in the autonomous vehicle industry due to its experience in supplying high-quality components for electronics as various high-profile domestic and international players have joined Taiwan’s autonomous vehicle market. The government is organizing a national team for the development of autonomous vehicles and has set out a plan to prepare for the advent of the autonomous vehicle era in Taiwan.</p>

<p>With more and more AI startups emerging, Taiwan is also booming with startup accelerators, education, and research. <a href="https://appworks.tw/accelerator/" title="https://appworks.tw/accelerator/">AppWorks Accelerator</a>, established in 2010 and currently focused on serving AI and Blockchain founders, has so far helped SEA founders launch over 40 AI/IoT startups into the market and continues to inject new energy into Taiwan’s AI ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/" title="https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft for Startups</a>, Taiwan AI x Robotics Accelerator, and many others, are all startup accelerators focused on recruiting AI founders. Taiwan AI School and Taiwan AI Labs are Taiwan’s represented institutions in the field of AI education and research. From 2020 and beyond, more and more resources are expected to be injected into the development of the AI field, which should further solidify Taiwan’s position as an AI hub in the GSEA region.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree Ray Chiu raises $5M for his biotech startup Calyx', '2020-02-04', '', '<p>In July, 2014, when a series of natural gas explosions ripped through the city of Kaohsiung overnight, Ray Chiu was in California studying for his Master’s degree at UC Berkeley. Disconcerted, he called the relatives who live not far from the area where the deadly disaster occurred. He had stayed at their apartment during the months of military service.</p>

<p>As these scenes of devastation stamped on his memory, he made up his mind to optimize the existing solution for chemical detection. Five years later, he landed a spot on the Forbes “30 Under 30" list in energy for the success of his startup <a href="https://calyxtechs.com/" title="https://calyxtechs.com/">Calyx</a> (renamed, formerly BioInspira), the first ever company to build gas sensor with bacteriophage, a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria.</p>

<p>Calyx has so far raised a $5M seed round from venture capitalists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and the US, making its founder a bright shining star among the legions of Taiwanese entrepreneurs based in Silicon Valley.</p>

<h2>Phage, explained</h2>

<p>His sensor is based upon phage, a unique type of biomaterial that is reusable and resilient to any temperature and chemicals of any pH values, unlike many other sensors that aren’t designed to withstand harsh conditions in industrial environments. Instead, they’re for laboratory testing only.</p>

<p>It’s true that electrochemical and some biomaterial-based ones can be turned to Internet-connect devices for real-time monitoring, but they don’t last more than one or two years. Thanks to phage, Calyx\'s sensor can last five to seven years on average. What’s more, the product is highly flexible and customizable because the biomaterial can be genetically modified to detect a certain type of chemical element.</p>

<p>Now, with its so-called “Sensors as a Service Platform,” Calyx serves not only food and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) companies but poultry farms.</p>

<p>“Birds have a respiratory system that are very different from that of mammals. For humans, most of the air we breathe in doesn’t reach our lungs, but for birds, their lungs are constantly ventilated because the air sacs permit,” explained Mr. Chiu. “Their respiratory tract is thus more prone to infection.” Calyx’s gas sensor can ensure the air is healthy enough for the birds to inhale.</p>

<h2>Startup for social good</h2>

<p>It’s difficult to build connections as a Taiwanese person in the Silicon Valley, Mr. Chiu put it bluntly. “At first, we have to show up at activities and events of all kind to know as many people as possible.” He also recounted the experience of taking part in a meeting as one of the two only Asians in the venue.</p>

<p>And it’s only after given cold shoulder by countless investors did he make it to raise $5M from a few.</p>

<p>Speaking of his journey, Mr. Chiu said the key lies not only in partners but in determination along the way. “Some think one has to have a brilliant idea to startup a business, but I don’t.” For him, startups ultimately “serve the social good,” and for that reason, one should go about turning an idea into action as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In fact, the notion of serving the society is also hidden behind the name of his startup, Calyx, which literally means the outermost whorl of flower parts. “It’s an important structure that protects the flower,” said Mr. Chiu.</p>

<p>“Cal,” in the name, can also signify the University of California, where he started the company in a lab. And the remaining “x” and “y,” associated with the two types of chromosome, imply the potential of the next generation.</p>

<p>In 2020, Mr. Chiu said the most effort will be put into sales promotion and Series A fundraising. “I’ve changed my mindset. It’s no big deal to be rejected,” he said, with a laugh. “I won’t feel that I’m not good enough because I’m not invested.” It’s this fearlessness toward failure, perhaps, that leads to Calyx’s success.</p>

<p>In 2006, he joined Google Taiwan as the first employee and since then has stood at the helm of the subsidiary for the following 14 years. As the managing director, he expands Google’s operations, prompts it to ramp up investment in Taiwan, and leads Google Taiwan to become its largest R&amp;D centers in Asia.</p>

<p>Last year, the American tech giant had announced <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45416" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45416">plans to set up a data center in Tainan</a> to support its growth in the Asia-Pacific region, following the inauguration of the same facility in Changhua six years ago.</p>

<p>Over the course of Dr. Chien’s 14 years in office, Google Taiwan has grown into a firm of more than 2,000 employees and 6 offices across the island, in Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chunghua, and Tainan.</p>

<p>He used to serve in Taiwan’s national academy Academia Sinica as a research fellow and deputy director of the Institute of Information Science and at the same time, work as a professor the department of information management of National Taiwan University and as a technical advisor at Microsoft Research Asia.</p>

<p><strong>With well-known expertise in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data search and processing, Dr. Chien has been mentoring entrepreneurs in Taiwan for years, including Appier\'s Chih-Han Yu and iKala\'s Sega Cheng; both of them are co-founder and CEO of their company. According to Appier’s press release, “His business acumen, thorough thinking, and precise judgment have helped many growing companies succeed.”</strong></p>

<p>“Dr. Chien is a proven and distinguished technology expert,” said Mr. Yu. “We are happy to welcome him as our independent board member and to leverage his significant industry know-how in driving Appier’s continued success and long-term growth.”</p>

<p>Not long ago, Appier had just <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760">raised US$80M Series D round</a>, pushing its VC funding to the tune of $162M.</p>

<p>Dr. Chien is looking forward to his new role as a board member, too. “I’ve witnessed Appier’s growth since its early days and have been impressed by its success and the resilience and vision of the founding team,” he said. “Appier, as a leader in AI solutions, will be part of transforming Taiwan into a human capital-oriented business landscape.”</p>

<p>His optimism about the future of AI application couldn’t be more clear, given that he chose to join two AI companies less than a month after retiring from Google. “Taiwan has a great opportunity in AI development, thanks to its legacy in hardware manufacturing and the increasing strength of the software industry,” he said.</p>

<p>In his conversation with iKala\'s CEO Sega Cheng, Dr. Chien stressed the importance for Taiwanese companies to be adventurous as entrepreneurs of the previous generations.</p>

<p>“He said Taiwan is surrounded by sea and short of natural resources. We can only survive with a global mindset,” said Mr. Cheng. “That’s why he greatly appreciates iKala’s move to expand into Southeast Asia.” The nine-year-old company now operates in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>

<p>"It is our honour to have Dr. Chien in our board,” said Mr. Cheng. “We hope iKala can accelerate its global expansion and growth with his international perspective and strong industry experience.”</p>

<p>“With the rapid rise of cross-border social commerce in Asia, iKala aims to provide even more pioneering AI commerce services in this field,” according to the firm’s press release.</p>

<p>A few weeks earlier, the New Zealand based startup had just finished a two-month training program at Hype SPIN sports accelerator in Taipei, Taiwan. It culminated in a <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45997" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45997">demo day</a>, where they pitched to an illustrious group of investors and industry experts about their software platform for coaches to track the performance and physical conditions of their athletes.</p>

<p>We sat down for a conversation with the Komodo team, asking what motivates them to start the venture, what keeps them passionate about what they do, and what brings them to the island some thousand miles away from the Kiwi land.</p>

<p>Sitting next to Mr. Wood was co-founder &amp; CEO Chris Bacon, who has four years of experience in Premier League in England and a PhD at sports science. The product that Komodo offers, in fact, is largely based upon his research project at the university.</p>

<p>“I wanted to do research that makes difference and can be used every single day,” he told us. By helping amateur athletes develop skills and avoid injury, the software will unlock greater athletic potential, as he explained Komodo’s vision on the demo day.</p>

<h2>Taking research into the real world</h2>

<p>“Over the past few years, there has been a 60% increase in youth sport injuries,” said Mr. Bacon. They mainly result from overtraining and poor well-being caused by malnutrition, dehydration, stress, and sleep deprivation.</p>

<p>Athletes suffering from bad physical and mental conditions cannot perform well as they can at most times. The situation only worsens when they try to do exercises they normally do.</p>

<p>Also, S&amp;C (strength and conditioning) coaches often struggle to prepare the athletes under their supervision. In most cases, coaches ask them to fill out surveys in order to understand their body conditions and end up with massive amount of data that are difficult to process. This is where Komodo’s app comes in — to automate the coach’s job, so “they can go and coach instead of having to go through spreadsheets,” said Mr. Bacon.</p>

</figure>

<p>The app automatically collects objective health data, including sleep time, heart rate, and walking distance, from the smartwatch that athletes wear. In the meantime, they’re tasked with inputting some data — about their diet, stress level, and so on — into the app on their own. Combining facts and opinion, the software is able to generate insights into how athletes can get the most out of training without hurting themselves.</p>

<p>Smartwatch isn’t a must have, Mr. Bacon added. But the more data the app collects, the better the advice it can possibly offer. The team is also looking to secure a manufacturing partner in Taiwan to provide the hardware for its customers.</p>

<p>He gave an example to explain the type of advice available: an athlete, who is able to squat 200 kilograms, may have difficulty doing so after a night of one-hour sleep. Instead of sticking to the same weight, the app would suggest that they do 150. “We adapt the program based on the response from athletes,” he concluded.</p>

<p>With the app, athletes are also allowed to report injuries and inform their coaches if they’ve done extra training sessions, which can lead to fatigue.</p>

<p>“Next big development we are doing is being able to develop a program for each athlete,” said Mr. Bacon. The app may suggest that an athlete do a certain number of pushups and pullups, once powered by artificial intelligence in the future.</p>

<h2>Towards the number one choice for developing athletes worldwide</h2>

<p>Positioning itself as a sports analytics software, Komodo helps coaches to supervise and develop amateur athletes with an easy-to-use dashboard. It’s now sold as a service to coaches of school teams and sports clubs on a B2B basis.</p>

<p>“We work with any sport, from football to rugby,” Mr. Bacon pointed out. It’s one of the major advantages that allow the startup to stand out from competitors.</p>

<p>Globally, the market value for such type of software stands at $5B and it’s growing, he said. “A lot of competitors in the space sit in elite sports.” It’s in fact only until recent years that entrants started to emerge in the amateur space, as the awareness towards data collection rises.</p>

<p>Mr. Bacon believes that data, once properly analyzed, can be a valuable asset. For instance, athletes may use them to build resume and apply for universities, and college scouts may use them to find the best players for their teams.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1581734496416.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-02/img-1580668382-54049@900.jpg 900w" title="komodo monitr" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 800px;">

<p>“We want to become the number one choice for developing athletes worldwide,” he said, by helping them monitor high-quality data. The startup expects to close its seed round of funding in February and expand into Australian market this year.</p>

<p>Given their plan to go global, they jumped at the opportunity when offered a place at the Taipei-based accelerator, Mr. Bacon told us. The resources and connections with major sports brands that they then would have access to are another pull.</p>

<p>Speaking of Taiwan, besides a manufacturing hub where they seeks to find a wearable maker to work with, he said it’s a test bed for East and Southeast Asian market. The two co-founders have considered offering their service to private schools in Taiwan such as Taipei American School.</p>

<p>Overall, their experience in Taiwan seems positive. “Everybody is keen to help you succeed here, ” said Mr. Wood.</p>

<p>However, the number of confirmed cases of the virus has still been rising and notably surged after China introduced <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-death-toll-infections-outbreak-evacuations-cruise-ship-latest-updates-2020-02-12/" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-death-toll-infections-outbreak-evacuations-cruise-ship-latest-updates-2020-02-12/">a new way of counting them</a>. The most recent <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-death-toll-infections-outbreak-evacuations-cruise-ship-latest-updates-2020-02-12/" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-death-toll-infections-outbreak-evacuations-cruise-ship-latest-updates-2020-02-12/">reports</a> show that over 70,000 have contracted with the virus and more than 1,700 have died, with the vast majority in China, where major cities have been locked down and travel restrictions have been imposed on citizens to contain the situation.</p>

<p>Outside China, so far, there have been the most confirmed cases of infection in Singapore (75), followed by Japan (61, excluding the cases found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship), Hong Kong (58), Thailand (35), South Korea (30), Malaysia (22), and Taiwan (20), according to <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/3070286" title="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/3070286">Liberty Times</a>. The virus has claimed at least one life in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philiphines.</p>

<p>As the spectre of the epidemic looms over the world, the demand for face masks spike and thereby leads to <a href="https://qz.com/1793749/wuhan-coronavirus-mask-shortage-illustrates-basic-economic-theory/" title="https://qz.com/1793749/wuhan-coronavirus-mask-shortage-illustrates-basic-economic-theory/">shortage</a> and skyrocketing of their prices. In Japan, two packs of seven masks could cost up to 99,999 yen ($910), when the retail price per pack is set at 405 yen, according to <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200206/p2g/00m/0na/011000c" title="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200206/p2g/00m/0na/011000c">The Mainichi</a>. There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks" title="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks">cases</a> where Chinese companies urged their employees working overseas to buy the much-needed masks and send them back to China.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, the situation seems to be in control, compared with that in most neighboring countries. Now, the price of face masks stands at NT$5 ($0.17) per piece, and panic — over having no mask to wear and therefore being exposed to the deadly virus — has been abating.</p>

<p>Last week, prime minister Su Tseng-chang <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/120940/4345088" title="https://udn.com/news/story/120940/4345088">announced</a> that around 10 million masks will be produced each day by the end of February. It’s more than a fivefold rise in production within a month.</p>

<p>As one of the countries closest to the epicenter of the virus outbreak, the number of confirmed cases has been relatively low, too. In addition, two out of 20 virus patients in Taiwan have fully recovered, authorities revealed.</p>

<h2>Government efforts</h2>

<p>Surely, much of the credit goes to the government. First and foremost, it was rather quick to ban all the flights from China, in early February. In the meantime, border control has been tightened and measures enforced to ensure citizens with travel history to China isolate themselves for two weeks.</p>

<p>Authorities have also geared up for the possible spread of the coronavirus. Two weeks ago, minister of health and welfare Chen Shih-chung <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3873436" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3873436">led a medical screening</a> on SuperStar Aquarius as the ship berthed at the port of Keelung. He stressed that the medical staff is extremely cautious in ensuring the health of people in Taiwan. Fortunately, all 1,700 passengers were tested negative for the virus.</p>

<p>In response to the panic buying of face masks, the government put an embargo on the exports of masks at the first moment and later worked with programmers to <a href="https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-mask-real-name-system/" title="https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-mask-real-name-system/">roll out an ID-based rationing system in just 72 hours</a>. It allows citizens to purchase two pieces of masks at a time after presenting their health insurance card in a pharmacy. The premier <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3874734" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3874734">said</a> the system is likely to be phased out by the end of February, when the supplies of masks will be replenished.</p>

<h2>Solid foundations</h2>

<p>Such feat couldn’t have been possible without the country’s superior healthcare system, which has just ranked No. 1 in the world for the second time, according to <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/11/2003730760" title="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/11/2003730760">Numbeo</a>’s survey, and its cloud database built five years ago. Taiwan’s robust and reliable communications infrastructure also prevents the new online system from crashing due to high traffic.</p>

<p>Premier Su attributes the successful launch of the system to the solidarity between the government, industry, and civil society, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gogogoeball/videos/614860152417676/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCSV8c4uySHdvEcF44EHTeBsQ-XvViK9UUf9ci0-kDjEERabVPj0Slpvj-901wNbzTyQE2MvYc-A3D0xg3URSUVj9MFeaHeudG4cun7x7zuCZMBuYoN8kP2XvzMK43xH7rnAYafdcyf8nExRZ_8EnwyqDzEWLqNHouOFeyMgYGS_J_voUZYuw-mwIDfy7pqy_p2irhYv3OqkFGFdYzBF_UE8do75ySx7Xgi1DOMgoe7cZhWXXWkt3m93GB6GXxLURlaaH-RrTDIoGYTlDD_WeLSYdD5E8RzgLteTJYm7byOZ6nrJ3CLDTdAUVJnqE5bZ4yJZ0OSJZ3H-lhJ8k8hTFbyGjPeEw&amp;__tn__=-R" title="https://www.facebook.com/gogogoeball/videos/614860152417676/?__xts__[0]=68.ARCSV8c4uySHdvEcF44EHTeBsQ-XvViK9UUf9ci0-kDjEERabVPj0Slpvj-901wNbzTyQE2MvYc-A3D0xg3URSUVj9MFeaHeudG4cun7x7zuCZMBuYoN8kP2XvzMK43xH7rnAYafdcyf8nExRZ_8EnwyqDzEWLqNHouOFeyMgYGS_J_voUZYuw-mwIDfy7pqy_p2irhYv3OqkFGFdYzBF_UE8do75ySx7Xgi1DOMgoe7cZhWXXWkt3m93GB6GXxLURlaaH-RrTDIoGYTlDD_WeLSYdD5E8RzgLteTJYm7byOZ6nrJ3CLDTdAUVJnqE5bZ4yJZ0OSJZ3H-lhJ8k8hTFbyGjPeEw&amp;__tn__=-R">his Facebook post</a>.</p>

<p>What’s more, with the help of digital minister Audrey Tang, a public API (application programming interface) allowing access to the data on the cloud, such as pharmacy locations and the inventory level of face masks in each spot, has been made available. Developers are therefore given an opportunity to create new applications to contribute to the society.</p>

<p>In fact, the minister herself has set up a <a href="https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/" title="https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/">platform</a> with some local organizations to gather all the apps, ranging from maps, virtual assistants, to chatbots. There have been 80 apps in total built upon the open data from the administration of National Health Insurance so far, she <a href="https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-open-government-implements-mask-supply-and-demand-platform/" title="https://technews.tw/2020/02/15/taiwan-open-government-implements-mask-supply-and-demand-platform/">said</a>, and countries including the US have shown great interest in this nationwide project.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.trade.gov/knowledge-product/taiwan-market-overview?section-nav=5607" title="https://www.trade.gov/knowledge-product/taiwan-market-overview?section-nav=5607">Export.gov</a>, more than 85 percent percent of Taiwanese citizens have access to the Internet and over 70 percent of them do so with a smartphone, making it one of the most connected user bases in the world. As a result, there’s practically no difficulty for anyone to make use of these new services.</p>

<p>The government said it will soon introduce an online platform for visitors to fill out health data as part of the border screening measures, according to <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3876685" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3876685">Taiwan News</a>.</p>

Lee Chun-Yi, Deputy Secretary-General to the President, Audrey Tang, Minister without Portfolio, Chen Jen-ran, Ambassador-at-large, and Raymond Greene, AIT Deputy Director jointly announced that 2020 Presidential Hackathon would be open for submission of proposals from March 2 to April 17. The event will be supervised by the Office of the President, organized by the Executive Yuan, co-organized by the Board of Science and Technology and National Development Council, and implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This year marks the 3rd anniversary of the event. The National Development Council will be the coordinator for national data support in the 2020 Presidential Hackathon. Hackers from the private sector are encouraged to work with the public sector using open-source data to enhance the innovation and efficiency of public services. Representatives from the Legislative Yuan, Examination Yuan, Control Yuan, and central and local governments were also present.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary-General to the President Lee said that the Presidential Hackathon aims to facilitate public-private collaboration by organizing a competition and to innovate public services using open-source data. Under the theme of sustainable development, this year\'s event focuses on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN in 2015 and includes a parallel international track, demonstrating Taiwan\'s determination to expand partnerships and address global and regional issues. We hope that cross-border, cross-agency and cross-domain talents will come up with collaborative proposals and solutions to diverse sustainability issues.</p>

<p>Ambassador-at-large Chen quoted the slogan of g0v in his remarks: Do not ask why there is nobody doing this. You have to admit that you are the "nobody". Almost all of the ten winning teams of the Presidential Hackathon of the previous two years have started to implement their proposals. According to Ambassador Chen, he was glad to see concrete results achieved jointly by the government and experts from the private sector. The event this year aims to bring together teams from different countries to address the current public health emergency and environmental issues, such as climate change, and foster international cooperation.</p>

<p>AIT Deputy Director Greene pointed out that Hackathon is an integral part of solutions to global issues. It is estimated that 2.5 billion people will move to urban areas in the next three decades, imposing great challenges on economic development, environment, and the well-being of people. City governance, thus, will become important. Taiwan will spare no effort to contribute to the solutions to social issues. Mr. Green highlighted the longstanding US-Taiwan partnership in addressing global issues by pointing out that the friendship between the US and Taiwan and their concerted efforts have enabled mutual benefits and significant development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minister without Portfolio Tang stated that the Presidential Hackathon in 2018 and 2019 were themed around \'social innovation\' and \'smart nation\' respectively with a total of 236 teams. The winners\' proposals have become not only references for policy implementation but role models for local initiatives going global. For example, in 2018, the team "Saving Water Resources" from Taiwan Water Corporation was invited to participate in a hackathon in New Zealand immediately after winning the award; in 2019, the team "Rounding Team" from the Ministry of Health and Welfare went to Columbia University in New York to present their proposal. All individuals and teams are welcome to submit their proposals and collaboratively promote Taiwan\'s sustainability and visibility.</p>

<p>The top five SDG topics revealed in the Press Conference are those concerning Taiwan citizens the most from the Civic Wishing Pool up to February 15, though the Pool is going to remain open until March 20. Citizens are welcome to make wishes, and hackers are invited to make them come true!

<p>One after another, they pitched their ideas to an audience of regional investors, entrepreneurs, and media outlets on the demo day in Taipei; the same event will take place in Singapore later this week.</p>

<p>Based in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Malaysia, the ten startups from this cohort target mobile-only users in emerging markets who primarily use their smartphones to carry out daily tasks. Collectively, they have over 10 million users and US$1 million in revenue.</p>

<p>“The first billion internet users accessed the Internet using their PCs, but the next four billion users — Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and South America — are mobile-only," explained William Bao Bean, Managing Director of MOX and General Partner of SOSV. "Hundreds of millions of users are getting on the Internet with smartphones."</p>

<p>With global mentors and partners including smartphone brands, telecom companies, and mobile content providers, MOX helps startups acquire users for free and drive higher lifetime value. Therefore, instead of selling equity to buy online ads, startups in the accelerator program are able to focus on building unit economics before raising additional capital.</p>

<p>SOSV, the US-based VC firm behind MOX and an active early-stage investor, has invested $100K-120K in each company in this batch.</p>

<p>“MOX has been focusing on building real businesses with revenue and even profit. Now that ‘growth at any cost’ is out of style, our startups are specifically positioned to excel because of the focus on positive unit economics from day one,” said Mr. Bao Bean.</p>

<p>Launched in 2015, MOX leads consumer mobile startups in India, Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia and South Asia to take advantage of the massive opportunity created by cheap internet and smartphones. It has famously backed AI-enabled English pronunciation coach ELSA and price-compare and cash-back platform BigGo.</p>

		<p><a href="https://coolbitx.com/" title="https://coolbitx.com/">CoolBitX</a>
			<a href="https://coolbitx.com/" title="https://coolbitx.com/"></a>, a blockchain security startup headquartered in Taiwan, announced this week that it has raised $16.7M in Series B round of funding. It’s spearheaded by returning investor SBI Holdings (a Japanese financial group formerly known as Softbank Investment), with participation from the <a href="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=9F0C4DE5BC5FFEFD" title="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=9F0C4DE5BC5FFEFD">National Development Fund of Taiwan</a>, Japanese financial firm Monex, and Korean crypto exchange BitSonic.</p>

		<p>With this new funding, the company plans to expand Sygna’s presence beyond the APAC region as the first-to-market FATF compliant solution for virtual asset service providers around the world. It also seeks to continue innovating its bluetooth-enabled hardware wallet CoolWallet S, the flagship product with a focus on security, functionality, and usability, according to its press release.</p>

		<p>Last June, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an independent intergovernmental body that develops and promotes policies to protect the global financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing, released a new guidance governing virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which applies the FATF Recommendation 16 to VA transfers.</p>

		<p>To “prevent terrorists and other criminals from having unfettered access to wire transfers for moving their funds” and to detect such misuse when it occurs, financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, <a href="https://www.acamstoday.org/navigating-fatf-recommendation-16/" title="https://www.acamstoday.org/navigating-fatf-recommendation-16/">are required to collect personal data</a> of both the originator and the beneficiary of any given payment.</p>

		<p>CoolBitX then launched Sygna Bridge, a messaging-based know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) solution, in October — to enable VASPs to easily share the data in compliance with the FATF framework.</p>

		<p>The startup has signed a memorandum of understanding with 12 exchanges that are currently using or testing the service, including Japan-based VC Trade (owned by SBI Holdings), Korea-based BitSonic, Taiwan-based MaiCoin, and so on.</p>

		<p>“Sygna’s progress has been in line with our strides made in crypto KYC/AML in various Asian jurisdictions, especially Japan,” said Founder and CEO Michael Ou. “As such, CoolBitX will be establishing a Sygna entity in Japan this year as we are committed to having open dialogues with local stakeholders.”</p>

		<p>With Sygna and CoolWallet S, he said the company aims to “build the infrastructure necessary to bridge the gap between crypto industry and the mainstream market.”</p>

		<p>“The borderless nature of digital assets requires a solution that isn’t bound by geographical boundaries,” said Yoshitaka Kitao, President and CEO of SBI Holdings. “We are proud to partner with CoolBitX on their journey to bring a secure and easy-to-implement system to the world.” The Japanese financial giant <a href="http://www.finsmes.com/2018/09/coolbitx-raises-13m-in-venture-capital-funding.html" title="http://www.finsmes.com/2018/09/coolbitx-raises-13m-in-venture-capital-funding.html">has also invested</a> in the Taiwanese startup in its previous funding round last year.</p>

		<p>“CoolBitX and Michael Ou have been a steady presence in the growing blockchain space in Taiwan,” Chen Mei-ling, Minister of the National Development Council. “We are proud to support a home-grown Taiwanese firm like CoolBitX as it continues to accelerate its growth on the global stage.” The national fund it manages has also backed Gogoro and Appier, both of which are commonly regarded as the first unicorns born in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Until now, more than $50M has been pumped into the four-year-old company, supporting its operations across Asia, in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea, where it claimed to have served over three million students.</p>

<p><strong>With this new funding, Snapask plans to expand into Vietnam, launch a regional headquarter in Singapore, and focus on markets in Southeast Asia where it sees growing demand for tutoring and other private education services. As it reaches more customers, another focus will be on developing data analytics products and video learning content.</strong></p>

<p>“Snapask is a clear illustration of Asia Partners’ focus on solving the growth capital funding gap for tech companies in Southeast Asia,” Nick Nash, co-founder and managing partner of Asia Partners. “The company has already demonstrated a strong product market fit in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore and is already successfully expanding in emerging markets like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.”</p>

<p>He added that the company is a great example of rhino, which he defines as a startup “focusing on sustainable growth with a clear path to profitability.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, Snapask entered the market with its app that matches students with questions to quality tutors for instant one-on-one learning sessions. Dubbed as the “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/29/snapasks-timothy-yu-on-creating-the-uber-for-tutoring-in-asia.html" title="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/29/snapasks-timothy-yu-on-creating-the-uber-for-tutoring-in-asia.html">Uber for tutoring</a>,” the startup promotes a personalized, self-directed learning journey in which a student can upload a question or photo of their question to the app and connect in about 10 seconds with a tutor, who will then offer an answer within seconds.</p>

<p>Founder and CEO Timothy Yu <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/56716/snapask-got-investment" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/56716/snapask-got-investment">believes</a> that “self studying is the only effective learning approach in the future,” and he hopes students start direct their own learning by “asking why.”</p>

<p>Students can pay $108 (NT$3,290) per month to ask as many questions as possible, or they can pay every time they ask a question on the app.</p>

<p>The company has been expanding its offerings: it now delivers online courses covering topics of university entrance and industry-specific exams and provides AI-enabled learning progress tracking and analysis. In addition, it also runs after-school self-study space and offline classes in Hong Kong, Taipei, and Seoul, called Lab.</p>

<p>“Snapask is not only leveraging fragmented education resources,but also developing AI-enabled, low cost, tailor-made education,” said Randolph Hsu, founding partner of Ondine Capital.</p>

<p>It has established a strong market presence in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore in the past three years, where it said that 20- 60% of the student population aged between 10 to 17 have registered and experienced its tutoring service. In Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, it sees the number of users grow at a high speed.</p>

<p>Besides gaining traction in new markets, Snapask aims to collaborate with more schools and educational institutions to take advantage of the data it has been collecting from students like learning behaviors and obstacles, which will help not only students to learn better but teachers to teach better.</p>

However shocking, it’s a tip of the iceberg as this damaging crime is on the rise.</p>

<p>Formerly known as man-in-the-email attack, BEC is a sophisticated type of scam in which a hacker compromises business email accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds, as the FBI defines. The US agency has been tracking the financial cyber threat since 2013, and revealed in its <a href="https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf" title="https://pdf.ic3.gov/2019_IC3Report.pdf">2019 Internet crime report</a> that BEC, though accounts for only 5% of the reported cases of fraud, causes 50% of the loss from all cyber activities last year. It <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-bec-scams-accounted-for-half-of-the-cyber-crime-losses-in-2019/" title="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-bec-scams-accounted-for-half-of-the-cyber-crime-losses-in-2019/">costs each victim $75,000 on average</a>, which translates to a loss of over $1.7 billion in a year.</p>

<p>Earlier this year in January, Taiwanese startup <a href="https://www.chainsecurity.asia/" title="https://www.chainsecurity.asia/">BlockChain Security</a> launched an email verification tool called ChkSender as a response to the growing number of BEC attacks. As a Chrome extension, it goes through each email in Gmail to ensure it’s not tampered with during transmission.</p>

<p>With ChkSender installed, the user has access to an array of data about the sender of any given email, including server location, domain name, and domain owner. Meanwhile, the extension verifies the sender’s identity based on these data and examines other parts of the email like address and the message body.</p>

<p>Before sending out an email, the user is offered two options to protect themselves from potential fraud: to sign the email with a digital signature and record a copy on the blockchain, or encrypt the entire email with a password known only by the recipient (who has installed the extension to Chrome).</p>

<p>The former allows ChkSender to compare the footprints in the received email and on the blockchain and tell if the email is altered in transit; if so, it means that the mail server may have been hacked. The latter prevents attackers from changing what’s been written in the email in a rather straightforward way, since the recipient is supposed to be the only person capable of decrypting and later reading it.</p>

<p>As the next step, according to its CTO, BlockChain Security expects to develop a version for Outlook users and build AI into the product so that it can analyze what the message in the email means and better identify hackers who pretend to sound like the sender when illegally rewriting the email. The extension is currently free for download.</p>

<p>ChkSender is the two-year-old company’s second application, following Blockchain Witness, an app used for evidence collection launched last year in July. With this blockchain solution, the user can take photos, record videos, or do screenshots while ensuring that these data are trustworthy enough to be presented in court.</p>

<p>The app uses GPS to pinpoint when and where a piece of evidence is collected, and as a unique digital footprint (hash value) is generated, a copy of it will be recorded on the blockchain. What the user needs to do to authenticate the evidence in court is to compare the two footprints in the device and on the blockchain. If there isn’t a mismatch, the evidence is tamper-proof.</p>

<p>In the long run, CEO Po Huang said the team plans to build a “cloud platform for blockchain solutions” across a wide range of use cases and go global.</p>

<p>Taiwanese startup <a href="https://www.appier.com/" title="https://www.appier.com/">Appier</a> is one of them. With <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45760">the $80M Series D round last year</a>, it has so far raised a total of $162M from venture capitalists to "innovate in AI for industries beyond digital marketing."</p>

<p>This week, the firm announced in a press conference that a former computer science professor Dr. Shou-De Lin has just come on board as a Chief Machine Learning Scientist. With over 20 years of academic experience in AI, knowledge discovery, and natural language processing, he is the third scientist to be invited to join the team. He called Appier “the first international AI company born in Taiwan.”</p>

<p>During his teaching career at National Taiwan University (NTU), Dr. Lin famously set up the Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining lab and won six championships in the KDD Cup, an annual data mining competition organized by the Association for Computing Machinery.</p>

<p>Also, as a former consultant, he helped Appier optimize a machine learning model that detects hesitant online shoppers, following its <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45571" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45571">acquisition of Japanese startup Emin</a>.</p>

<h2>Taking research into the real world</h2>

<p>Before joining the team, Dr. Lin said he had met Appier’s Co-founder and CEO Chih-Han Yu in major AI conferences and was pleased to see how the startup tries to keep up with the latest tech trends. “Appier puts a lot of focus on turning research results into new products and services,” Mr. Lin added.</p>

</figure>

<p>As a former professor and Chief Machine Learning Scientist for Appier, one of his main missions is to bridge the gap and facilitate the synergy between industry and academia.</p>

<p>“I am already immersed with my colleagues and I look forward to both working alongside and guiding them in further developing solutions that not only solve challenges for our customers but also open up new business opportunities,” he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Lin believes the experience in the startup will give him the opportunity to understand and learn from the market that new AI applications can benefit in many ways, too.</p>

<p>He compared building an AI model to taking an exam: “It’s easy to score 60 (out of 100), but difficult to score 90, and the 30 points (for optimization) is what makes all the difference.”</p>

<p>Besides recruiting experts from the university, Co-founder and CEO Mr. Yu also announced in the press conference another way his company promotes the collaboration between industry and academia: by sponsoring the newly-launched Appier AI Chair Professor Program. He said the goal of the program is to “invite experts from around the world to come to Taiwan and train local talent.”</p>

<p>In fact, Appier has been running a program since 2016 to sponsor selected students to attend top conferences like NeuroIPS, ICML, and ICLR and present their research findings. So far, over a hundred have benefited from the program and stood on the global stage to showcase Taiwan’s research capabilities in AI, according to the firm.</p>

<p>With past experience in the university, Mr. Yu and his team understand well how important yet challenging it is to turn insights derived from research studies into valuable, real-life applications. “Researchers has a quite different perspective than us,” he said. That’s why the company strives to build a bridge between the two worlds by offering travel grants for students and inviting them to share what they’ve learnt with the team.</p>

<h2>Trends and challenges</h2>

<p>"The evolution of AI will bring about a paradigm shift in technological development,” said Dr. Ming-Syan Chen, Executive Vice President of NTU. “Exploring innovation in AI is one of the most important topics in the global technology community.”</p>

<p>He pointed out three areas where AI has the most potential: healthcare, manufacturing, and the service sector. The technology not only change industries but “form its own industry.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Mr. Yu said more efforts should be made in several areas to unleash the potential of AI, including ensuring data integrity and accuracy and preparing the public for the wide application of AI technology.</p>

<p>While the technology enables a number of new services, Dr. Chen said, it’s vital for companies like Appier to acquire industry-specific domain knowledge to build what users need.</p>

<p>In response to this, Mr. Yu shared his startup story: “In the early days, when we just started Appier, a lot of our solutions failed because we didn’t know what users need,” Mr. Yu said. “Now, we learn from them to decide what solution we can provide to help them.” This is what he called “market-driven innovation” based on a user-centered approach.</p>

<p>The next step, for Appier, is to see if they can adopt such solution across different industries and markets.</p>

This article provides answers to some frequently asked questions according to the latest information released by the Centers for Disease Control under the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Which countries and territories are classified as affected areas that will require me to undergo 14-day home quarantine?</strong>
	<br>All foreign nationals are forbidden from entering Taiwan starting March 19, with exceptions for those who hold Alien Resident Certificates or documents proving they are on urgent diplomatic, business or other special missions. All entrants are now required to undertake 14-day home quarantine, regardless of nationality.
	<br>
	<br><strong>How is 14 days prior to arrival defined?</strong>
	<br>If a passenger arrives in Taiwan on April 15, the 14 days prior to arrival will be April 1-14.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Must I undergo quarantine if I have a passport from a listed country but have not been there in the past 14 days?</strong>
	<br>Arrivals are only subject to quarantine if they have been in a country or territory under a level three travel advisory in the past 14 days, including airport transfers through China, Hong Kong, Macao and Dubai.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Can I shorten the quarantine period if I spend time in a third country before arriving in Taiwan?</strong>
	<br>No. The quarantine will be enforced for all those who have visited a specified country or territory in the past 14 days, including airport transfers through China, Hong Kong, Macao and Dubai.
	<br>
	<br><strong>When does the quarantine process start?</strong>
	<br>Immediately upon landing at the airport. Arrivals will be given a health declaration and home quarantine notification form before passing through immigration, which they must complete and sign. This form can be filled in <a href="https://hdhq.mohw.gov.tw/">electronically</a> to save time.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Where does quarantine take place?</strong>
	<br>Quarantine takes place at your home or at your planned place of stay in Taiwan. As of March 17, foreign nationals can rent a room in a public quarantine center. Please call 1922 (toll free) for more details.
	<br>
	<br><strong>How to travel to your place of quarantine?</strong>
	<br>Arrivals subject to quarantine must not take public transport. If you do not have a private vehicle, regularly disinfected taxis with drivers wearing protective gloves and surgical masks are available at all Taiwan airports. All passengers must wear a surgical mask during transport.
	<br>
	<br><strong>What must I do during quarantine?</strong>
	<br>Stay in your accommodation. Do not go outside or leave the country. Keep daily records of your body temperature and any symptoms as listed in the health declaration and home quarantine notice.
	<br>
	<br><strong>What should I do if symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, breathing difficulty, headache and fatigue) occur during quarantine?</strong>
	<br>If you experience any of these symptoms, wear a surgical mask and call 1922 to obtain instructions on seeking medical attention. Telemedicine services are also available for those in quarantine.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Are there any mental health support services I can access during quarantine?</strong>
	<br>A toll-free hotline 1925 can provide counseling services for those in quarantine.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Can I leave my accommodation to buy food or other items?</strong>
	<br>Leaving your accommodation is strictly prohibited until the end date indicated on the quarantine form.
	<br>
	<br><strong>If I agree to leave Taiwan can I leave quarantine early?</strong>
	<br>Leaving Taiwan before the end of the quarantine period is strictly prohibited.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Will anyone check on me? What happens if I break the rules?</strong>
	<br>You will be checked on once or twice a day by officials in charge of quarantine. Leaving your accommodation will result in a fine of up to NT$1,000,000 (US$33,063).
	<br>
	<br><strong>Must I be alone in my accommodation during quarantine?</strong>
	<br>Quarantine is a precautionary measure for people who do not have symptoms, but there is no need to avoid contact with others staying with you if you are feeling well. But you should maintain a social distance of at least one meter and observe strict hand hygiene. Other measures include keeping your accommodation clean and well-ventilated, sticking to a designated quarantine room, disinfecting the kitchen, bathroom and door handles daily, as well as avoiding sharing towels.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Is home quarantine the same as 14-day self-health management?</strong>
	<br>Arrivals who have visited a country or territory subject to a level one or level two travel advisory are asked to conduct 14-day self-health management. This involves taking your temperature daily, wearing a surgical mask in public, avoiding crowded places and watching for symptoms. Unlike quarantine, self-health management does not require people to stay in their accommodation.

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('Taipei-based Italian entrepreneur breaks into international markets with his solution helping game apps acquire real users', '2020-03-11', 'Startup News', '<p>Imagine you’re a mobile game developer, who invests millions of dollars in developing a game. After around a year of struggle with the team, you finally release it on App Store and Google Play — only to realize it’s a drop in the ocean of the six million games in these online stores.</p>

<p>As you try and build stickiness into your product, you might need to double down on paid user acquisition. It’s indeed one of the few, if not the only, ways to be noticed in the deluge of game apps when you don’t have a large user base of early adopters. Unfortunately, here comes another challenge: statistics show that 40% of the online ad spending goes to fake users and 59.5% is wasted on users who don’t even spend a dime on the app. In other words, investing on these ads is pretty much like pouring money down the drain.</p>

<p>This is what Stefano Roncari encountered when he was working on his previous startup in Beijing. He and his team spent a lot on promoting their game but didn’t see many users download it on their phone, let alone paying for it.</p>

<p>Most games die exactly because of the low return on ad spend, he told Business Next. “The average cost for acquiring a user is much higher than the revenue you can get from a user.”</p>

<h2>Looking into the black box</h2>

<p>Fraud is one of the most common issues around online ads, including fake clicks and installations. “On mobile phones, every app is like a black box,” Mr. Roncari said. Unlike on a web browser where cookies are available, it’s almost impossible to know how the user uses the app, what they search, or even if they’re real users.</p>

<p>It can also happen that an ad publisher “steals” an organic user, claims that the advertiser acquires it by running a pay-per-download campaign on one of its pages, and asks for a fee. “It’s easy to cheat but difficult to catch a cheater,” he said. What’s worse, an ad publisher can charge the advertiser more for a user they buy from another publisher.</p>

<p>To help game publishers avoid these pitfalls and attract high quality users, Mr. Roncari co-founded <a href="https://www.bubbleye.com/" title="https://www.bubbleye.com/">Bubbleye</a> in Taipei in 2016 to launch Kraken, “the world’s first user acquisition autopilot.”</p>

<p>To maximize ROI, the AI-powered solution optimizes the advertising strategy — how it allocates budget by channel, country, and ad placement — as it monitors and controls campaigns across multiple platforms and channels in real time. It would take some weeks for a group of human advertising managers to achieve the same results.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Every second, it sees who has seen your ad, who has clicked on it, how many of them have installed, in which location they are, what time they click it, and how they behave after installing your app,” Mr. Roncari explained. “All these data are used to verify if the users are authentic and assess how much they’re worth.” The autopilot can also stop allocating budget to sites that bring in fake users and re-invest in others that bring in real users right away.</p>

<p>To use their service, an advertiser needs to offer “a definition of a good source of users” for the AI to learn, adapt, and spend the budget in the goal of achieving positive ROI.</p>

<p>“We provide a dashboard for our clients, but they normally check it only once in a week because everything is automated.” Mr. Roncari also said there isn’t yet a similar auto-optimization solution for apps in the market.</p>

<p>Unlike ad platforms that charge advertisers by cost per acquisition, Bubbleye prides itself on positioning the autopilot as an unbiased, third party platform so that it can not only identify fraud and inefficiencies but actively deal with it to make better use of ad budgets. “We bring in good users, [without concerning] where they come from,” Mr. Roncari concluded. “We become game publishers’ friend.”</p>

<p>Also, since they’re not involved in the cash flow (between ad platforms and advertisers), their clients are willing to share their data, collected from mobile measurement partners, with them while they wouldn\'t do so with other ad platforms.</p>

<p>Bubbleye Mobile Targeting : Kraken</p>

<h2>From Taiwan to the world</h2>

<p>Mr. Roncari told us that many people ask them if they would automate advertising for other types of clients in the future besides game publishers. “Every mountain is climbed one step at a time,” he said, noting their solution applies to many other industries.</p>

<p>Besides the team’s experience in gaming industry, the sheer size of the market also prompts them to focus on user acquisition for game apps first. According to Mr. Roncari, a mid-sized game publisher spends around $10M to $50M to gain online exposure every month, and one fourth of the mobile advertising spending worldwide, about $50B, goes to mobile games.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Taipei, Bubbleye now serves clients across the world, from East Asia, West Asia, North America, to Europe. “Because of word of mouth, we get to offer services to clients we have never thought before,” Mr. Roncari said with excitement.</p>

<p>When asked about why basing his business in Taipei, he said it allows easy access to engineering talent, funding, and global markets. Most importantly, he lives a happy and productive life here.</p>

<p>Selected to join the first <a href="https://mobileonlyx.com/" title="https://mobileonlyx.com/">MOX (Mobile Only Accelerator)</a> cohort, he and his team had visited Taipei for the first time after staying in Beijing for 13 years, and decided to relocate within a week.</p>

<p>2020 seems to be a year of turning point for the five-year-old company. With a new round of funding raised months earlier from Taiwan-based <a href="http://www.darwin-venture.com.tw/english/index.html" title="http://www.darwin-venture.com.tw/english/index.html">Darwin Venture</a>, it plans to expand its team and go global in 2021. The first stop will be Japan, whose gaming market is a “big missing part” in their business, and next, Europe and North America.</p>

With the funds, the company expects to double down on customer acquisition in Taiwan and prepares to expand into Singapore and Malaysia in 2021.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Founded in 2018, Omnichat specializes in cross-platform marketing, helping e-commerce stores improve conversion rates by tracking customer behavior, offering guidance to shoppers throughout their online experience, and launching effective retargeting campaigns.</p>

<p>It also offers a customer service system that integrates e-commerce sites with social media platforms such as LINE, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp; WeChat and Telegram will be added to the list this year.</p>

<p>Omnichat also expects to launch an initiative this year for digital marketing companies, agencies, and consultants to gather and develop innovative e-commerce solutions.</p>

<p>The company said e-commerce stores using its services enjoy conversion rates that are three to seven times better than others.</p>

<h2>Taiwan as launchpad for startups</h2>

<p>According to statistics, Taiwan has an e-commerce market worth $42.7B, two times as large as that of Indonesia, the largest economy in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>With a minimum viable product, Co-founder Alan Chan had come to Taiwan in 2018 to join Appworks accelerator and explore the market, according to the company\'s website.</p>

<p>But there are other reasons for him to start developing his business in Taiwan. "There\'s a great number of e-commerce stores in Taiwan and they\'re mostly very mature," he said.</p>

<p>"Even small e-commerce businesses attach great importance to marketing indicators such as traffic, data analysis, membership management, and marketing conversion rate." In other words, he believes they\'re well-positioned to use Omnichat\'s services.</p>

<p>In 2019, the company has served around 3,600 new customers, over 70% of whom are from Taiwan, including feminine care brand HH Herbal and smartphone case brand TOYSELECT.</p>

<p>Notably, in February, with its direct messaging platform, the company has helped two Taiwanese e-commerce stores monetize the sudden twofold increase in social media messages from customers as the demand for their products soars due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>Omnichat believes its story mirrors a trend for Hong Kong-born startups to cross the strait, explore Taiwan market, and prepare themselves for the bigger Southeast Asia market.</p>

<p>“SparkLabs Taipei encourages entrepreneurs to target the international market from day one," said Mr. Chiu. "That’s the mindset entrepreneurs in Taiwan must have."</p>

<p>Steven Chen, Youtube co-founder who has joined the accelerator months earlier as venture partner and advisor, said he has met many Taiwanese entrepreneurs who are hesitant about going global. “They often say: ‘I will wait until I have more traction and resources before I can expand into the international market,’ but crossing borders into new markets is actually not as expensive or difficult as one may think.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chen has <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45686" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45686">once encouraged Taiwanese founders</a> to “always think outside of the 23 million people in Taiwan.”</p>

Major investors include the Arm IoT fund and the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund; the former is an early-stage fund sponsored by Arm Holdings, a global semiconductor company owned by the Japanese Softbank Group and its Vision Fund, and the latter is a fund managed by the WI Harper Group.</p>

<p>Founded in 2014, the company has been known for its smart home devices, NextDrive Cube and Plug. It pivoted to energy management in 2017 and later secured a Series A round led by the Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund for its hardware design and data-gathering technology.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, NextDrive announced that the two devices will no longer be sold in Taiwan and NextDrive Connect, the app that connects them with mobile devices, will be unavailable by the end of August.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company has been developing its energy management business in Japan, where it introduces Cube J1 to promote the implementation of Home Energy Management System (HEMS), a technology platform that monitors and automates the use of energy within households. Connected with smart meters, the device serves as a gateway to such platform.</p>

<p>NextDrive says the energy market in Japan is still in its early stage of development. But the demand for devices like Cube J1 can be huge, as the Japanese government plans to install 80 million smart meters by 2023, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/47126/taiwan-startup-nextdrive-iot-energy-management-solution-welcomed-by-japanese-market" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/47126/taiwan-startup-nextdrive-iot-energy-management-solution-welcomed-by-japanese-market">Business Next</a>. The firm has been selling this solution to Chubu Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, two of Japan’s ten leading energy companies.</p>

<p>Alongside the liberalization of the energy market, these companies are then allowed to sell Cube J1 to households to know how they consume electricity so as to better decide how much to supply and thus reduce the cost of generation.</p>

<p>With the product, consumers are able to monitor their use of electricity and lower utility bills. It also allows them to store electricity from the grid during off-peak hours.</p>

<p>With the strategic investment from Arm IoT Fund, NextDrive says it looks to expand into other global markets and plans to further develop its services based on Pelion, Arm’s IoT platform that integrates connectivity technology with data and connected devices management. The company aims to help its clients extract new value from fragmented data and offer a one-stop platform for energy management.</p>

<p>Taiwanese crowdfunding news site <a href="http://crowdwatch.tw/" title="http://crowdwatch.tw/">CrowdWatch</a> publishes a report about Taiwan’s crowdfunding ecosystem every year. In the 2019 report, it <a href="https://www.2019.report.crowdwatch.tw/" title="https://www.2019.report.crowdwatch.tw/">points out</a> that over 900 local crowdfunding campaigns hit their funding goals and raised a total of more than NT$1.6B ($55.5M) last year.</p>

<p>In 2019, the 20 most-backed projects are backed by 9,511 people and the 20 most-funded projects receive NT$24M ($800k) on average. Both figures have seen a 50% growth over a year.</p>

<p>Since 2017, the number of projects that make it to raise more than NT$10M ($330k) doubles every year. In 2019, there are at least 35 such cases, including <a href="https://www.flyingv.cc/projects/24437" title="https://www.flyingv.cc/projects/24437">POIEMA Fit</a> (created by POIEMA), an air purifier for home that raises a whopping NT$134M ($4.4M) on flying V and makes the most-funded product ever in Taiwan. The same company has also raised around $1M for its car air purifier in 2018.</p>

<p>In recent years, there have also seen an increasing number of Taiwanese startups launching their products on US-based Indiegogo (such as personal air purifier <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45535" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45535">Luft Cube</a>), Japan-based Makuake (such as AI-powered coffee machine iDrip), and other overseas crowdfunding sites.</p>

<p>On local crowdfunding platforms, everyday consumer products -- such as bluetooth earbuds (created by XROUND), smart baby monitor (created by Cubo AI) and AI-powered, portable instant voice translation device -- are the most popular among backers. Eco-friendly products like reusable water bottle and straw for bubble tea have also seen increasing popularity as consumers are going greener to stop producing plastic waste; it can be linked to the ban on single-use straws that went into effect last year, too.</p>

<p>There are other crowdfunding products that attract numerous backers for how they address a real-life issue:</p>

<p><strong>Qbi magnetic toy blocks</strong>
	<br>Why are kids bored of toys so quickly? Qbi, believing it’s because they don’t have playmates sometimes, creates <a href="https://www.zeczec.com/projects/qbitoy" title="https://www.zeczec.com/projects/qbitoy">a modular set of magnetic toy blocks</a> to encourage children to have fun with their parents and at the same time develop logical and creative thinking skills. The company is confident that the toy not only is safe to kids but provides much better experience than others that are more affordable yet less interesting to play with.</p>

<p>1. Make face masks available online
	<br>You can do online purchases by inserting your National Health Insurance (NHI) card or Citizen Digital Certificate card into a card-reader linked to the computer with Internet access so that the pre-ordered masks can be sent to a nearby convenience store after you pay online. Download the National Health Insurance app and insert your NHI number can work as well. This new mechanism can be helpful for office workers and students who lack the time to go to pharmacies and public health centers.</p>

<p>2. Quarantine Package
	<br>The CECC also announced that starting from March 19, inbound travelers will be subject to a 14-day period of home quarantine after entering Taiwan. Each city offers different “quarantine package” for their citizens who are under home quarantine to take care of their stomach and mind. Everyone will get 14 face masks from the package. You may get household bleach water, instant noodles, seeds for you to grow and gain patience or a free account which you can watch TV series and movies during these 14 days.</p>

<p>3. Cut Your Hair Short!
	<br>One of our colleagues always wash hands and change her clothes the moment she arrives home. She won’t sit on her sofa or lie in her bed before washing her hair. To get rid of viruses and protect the health of her mother who lives with her, she cut her hair short so that she can wash it quickly and efficiently.</p>

The virus has infected thousands of people, with <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" title="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">more than 350,000 positive cases confirmed</a> by the time this article was published, leading to its <a href="https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/" title="https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/">recent</a> categorization of pandemic by the WHO.</p>

<p>As precautionary measures, the population starts to wear face masks and avoid physical contact with others to protect themselves from the highly contagious virus. It has also become commonplace for people to have their temperature checked before entering public spaces, especially hospitals and clinics.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, infrared temperature systems for mass screening can be seen in many high pedestrian areas like train stations and shopping malls. Earlier in March, Taipei Metro announced it may refuse to offer transport services to passengers that present a body temperature higher than 38°C.</p>

<p>The situation, grim as it is for everyone, has proved to be a boon for thermometer manufacturers in Taiwan like <a href="https://taidoc.com/" title="https://taidoc.com/">Taidoc</a>; it\'s expecting to sell twice the amount of forehead thermometers in March than it did in February. Others like Avita and Radiant Innovation have also noticed the increased demand for their products as numbers of their shares traded on the stock market skyrocket.</p>

<h2>Camera lens module for infrared temperature screening</h2>

<p>Alongside these established companies, some startups have also seen business boom as many countries attempt to contain the virus. For example, <a href="http://ade.tw/" title="http://ade.tw/">ADE Technology</a>, a company developing its own camera lens module for infrared temperature screening, says it expects to ramp up its annual production to 200,000 units by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Local schools have been installing the aforementioned module on their own surveillance camera to undergo temperature scans for students and teachers before they enter the campus. With the gadget installed, the surveillance camera can measure their temperature when they’re one to two meters away from it and report cases of fever in real time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1585272819118.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1584358085-63938@900.jpg 900w" title="Surveillance camera" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 1000px;">

</figure>

<p>The entire system serves as a convenient replacement for ear thermometers, which are widely used in many public spaces. For schools, a module for an existing camera is also way more affordable than a new set of screening facilities. In response, ADE Technology stated that it plans to lower the price of its proprietary surveillance system, making it one quarter to one fifth of the price of similar systems manufactured by international brands.</p>

<h2>The world’s smallest smart thermometer</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.iweecare.com/" title="https://www.iweecare.com">iWEECARE</a> is another startup that has received benefit and shown to be beneficial to combat the virus outbreak. The five-year-old company has been known for its mini wearable thermometer named Temp Pal. It’s so far the world’s smallest smart thermometer, which connects to the cloud and an app on the phone to provide real-time access to temperature data. Approved in the US and EU, it’s also a precise thermometer with a range of +/- 0.05 degrees of accuracy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1585272819176.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569307112-68491@900.jpg 900w" title="Temp Pal" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 1000px;">

</figure>

<p>As a B2C company, iWEECARE\'s target customers have long been mother-to-be and parents with newborn kids, who are sensitive to changes in body temperature. It’s only until recent months that it sees a significant growth as a B2B business. Since January, orders for Temp Pal from medical institutions across the world have been flowing in, including orders from Thailand and China.</p>

<p>The major reason behind such growth is their competitive advantage: Temp Pal allows healthcare workers to check the body temperature of multiple patients simultaneously without having any physical contact with them. Considering the duty of medical staff to take patients’ temperatures once every one or two hours, it is not difficult to imagine how helpful the functionality of their products turns out to be.</p>

<p>The Taiwanese company has been selling this temperature tracking solution to ten global markets, including countries worst hit by the coronavirus like Spain, Italy,and Germany. Interestingly, it has also been exhibited in a science museum in the UK.</p>

<p>In September last year, iWEECARE had raised a $1M Pre-A round led by Singapore’s Verge HealthTech Fund and participated by Taiwan- and US-based Translink Capital and Darwin Venture, seeking to disrupt a market forecast to reach $1.5 billion by 2025, currently dominated by digital pen and ear thermometers, according to <a href="https://e27.co/taiwans-smart-thermometer-startup-iweecare-raises-us1m-for-global-expansion-20190531/" title="https://e27.co/taiwans-smart-thermometer-startup-iweecare-raises-us1m-for-global-expansion-20190531/">e27</a>.</p>

	<br>
	<br>The new measures come into effect April 1 and include temperature checks for passengers at the Taiwan High Speed Rail stations of Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan and Zuoying; 192&nbsp;stops along the Taiwan Railways Administration train routes; and all airports, bus stations, highway service areas and post offices. Those who have two successive readings of over 37.5°C by forehead thermometer or 38°C by ear thermometer will be prohibited from entering these public facilities.
	<br>
	<br>To facilitate screening, thermal imaging cameras will be installed at the five THSR stations and 22 TRA stops ahead of the four-day holiday, the ministry said. All stations on the THSR system will be disinfected every two hours, and only reserved seats will be available April 2-5 to prevent overcrowding, it added.
	<br>
	<br>All THSR and TRA stations throughout the country are expected to have temperature checks in place from May 1.
	<br>
	<br>According to the MOTC, the constraints are in line with Article 37 of the Communicable Disease Control Act, which gives the government the right to restrict or prohibit patients or suspected patients with communicable diseases from taking public transportation or entering specific places during epidemics.
	<br>
	<br>Latest statistics from the CECC show 306 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan as of March 30, with five deaths. A total of 702,879 cases have been identified in 176 other countries and territories. (YCH-E)</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On March 6, President Donald Trump&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-centers-disease-control-prevention-atlanta-ga/" rel="follow" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that “anybody” in the US can take the coronavirus test although doctors and health officials reported a shortage of tests in the country.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The statement created confusion, and the media scrambled to fact-check the statement and reconfirmed with doctors and the statement turned to be false.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is just one of the many examples of how misinformation spreads in the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fake news is a grave problem, not just in the US but across the world, including Asia. Fake news and disinformation are created and spread through social networks and propaganda sites, which will have far-reaching consequences. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taiwan based&nbsp;</span><a href="https://e27.co/startups/qsearch/" rel="follow" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QSearch</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;came up with a remedy to tackle fake news&nbsp;</span>a few years ago<span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The company combats disinformation by helping government officials track high-velocity content that generates negative emotions by sending an email alert to government agencies, so the officials in charge can determine if the content needs to be removed.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its services are now being used by the governments in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines in their respective local languages.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In this interview with&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">e27,</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;QSearch Founder Roger Do shares his concerns about how the crisis is affecting businesses in Asia and what startups can do to cope with or how to recover from the crisis.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a data company, tell us how about your latest initiative that plans to help the community during this time?</span></strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Just like COVID-19, misinformation can go viral and does not respect borders; it replicates and travels faster than the physical virus. We have already seen self-medication-induced death stemming from President Trump’s statement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Therefore, to combat this as a social intelligence data platform, QSearch is offering free viral COVID behaviour alerts to government agencies.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When social media shows high-velocity content or content that generates high negative emotions, we send an email alert to the government agency so the officials in charge can determine if the content needs to be combated, mediated, or can be safely ignored.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While we were preparing the alerts for the Arab-speaking countries, we saw that the top news that went viral were fake remedies and cures. In fourth place, it was a Russian Today’s article broadcasting China’s claim that COVID-19 was a US biological weapon. A hazardous situation if left unmanaged.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wow, I guess conspiracy theories are not subjected to any location. But aside from that, which countries are you currently helping out? Are there other countries that you think are at a potentially higher risk for misinformation to spread?</span></strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QSearch started by offering the service to regional governments, and the agencies of Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines are already receiving frequent alerts in multiple languages.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We worked with the former Dean of Lee Kuan-Yu School of Pubic Policy, Dr Eduardo Araral, to offer this service through their alumni network since most of them are connected with their government.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We even had queries from Russian language-speaking countries, and we’re setting up alerts. We aim to help various governments in Asia, which have been hit the hardest, to have some digital assistance.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right now, we’re concerned with Indian, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The COVID-19 pressure is increasing and even though some people want to hide their emotions most of us are freaking on the inside. What steps do you think startup leaders must take during this tumultuous period?</span></strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">All startups must have two operating plans based on a world that will recover in 2019 and one where it won’t recover until 2021. When going through these planning processes, it’ll become apparent if a startup will survive or not.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you can survive, startups must plan and operate on the assumption of recovery and a potential bounce back. However, if your startup won’t make it its best to do a control shut-down, return the funding, take care of your people and your supporters.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Right now is the time to show one is a responsible leader, and life will ultimately reward one with another opportunity based on how the inevitable is handled.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That being said, on the brighter side, many companies are also offering free and additional services to combat the crisis, but what do you think could be the repercussions of this in the future? Would this be a problem?</span></strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Actually, it is the opposite many of the world’s powerful brands were created during times of struggles and therefore had an enduring emotional connection with the people they helped.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is very heartening to see so many startups pitching in to help as this is also a time to forge more inclusive bonds.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some startups will emerge from the epidemic with a life-long bond with their users, so this is the time to solve problems with the community rather than see it is a monetary hit.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a parting message, what advice would you give to entrepreneurs right now?</span></strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Never waste a good crisis. All companies must solve a problem, and this epidemic is a stress test on our modern lifestyle.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What startups and astute entrepreneurs can do at the time of a crisis is spot the cracks in the way society has operated and they will come up with solutions that may improve on the reliability, resiliency and the redundancy of the foundation of our everyday life.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is an opportunity to make our society and global community better and stronger, and only innovation can do that.</span>

<p><a href="https://www.ondinecap.com/" title="https://www.ondinecap.com/">Ondine Capital</a>’s founding partner Randolph Hsu, based in Shanghai, has been staying in his homeland Taiwan recently. He told Business Next via video conference that he has cancelled all business trips to Mainland China and Southeast Asia, where most of its portfolio companies are located, including <a href="https://snapask.com/" title="https://snapask.com/">Snapask</a>, <a href="https://www.carsome.my/v3/?" title="https://www.carsome.my/v3/?">Carsome</a>, and HiAR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hsu was visiting the Indonesian capital Jakarta for a local startup event expected to draw more than 450 attendees, but the plan fell through after it was scrapped due to concerns around the fast-spreading virus. However, he said overall, event cancellations have little impact on his deal flow as many roadshows go virtual.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with trade shows and conferences cancelled, <a href="https://www.infinityventures.com/" title="https://www.infinityventures.com/">Infinity Ventures</a> (IVP) told Business Next that its plans to connect with startup teams and other VC investors have been disrupted.</p>

<p>While its own event -- an annual summit for CEOs, scheduled in June -- is likely to be held online, the VC firm has also seen startups in its portfolio holding virtual events. “How to cultivate the community remotely is a big challenge,” said IVP partner Joseph Huang.</p>

<h2>Communication is the key</h2>

<p>As many companies, VCs are making the switch to remote work, and fortunately, the process has been almost painless. Mr. Huang told Business Next that his firm had given employees full flexibility to work from home long before most companies started to ask theirs to do so.</p>

<p>Early-stage VC firm <a href="https://cherubic.com/" title="https://cherubic.com/">Cherubic Ventures</a>, with offices in Beijing, San Francisco, and Taipei, said the transition to the new style of work is smooth because they have always been collaborating remotely.</p>

<p>The firm’s managing partner Tina Cheng said it’s true that meetings with portfolio companies aren’t held as frequently as before, but it doesn’t mean they communicate less. “Instead, we enhance communication with these companies in other means because of the current situation,” she explained.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1585705913071.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569296722-85540@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569296722-85540@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2019-09/img-1569296722-85540@900.jpg 900w" title="" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 1000px;">

<p>As companies “reconsider their plan for the year,” she said her team has been helping them prepare for the impact of the situation, ranging from reducing payroll bills to developing a plan in case an employee is put in quarantine or contracts the virus. “In general, they might need to be more thrifty,” she added.</p>

<p>Mr. Huang said his team has also had “more communication with their portfolio companies” recently to learn how they adapt and ensure they survive the economic downturn by reducing cash burn.</p>

<p>The reduction of face-to-face meetings, though doesn’t seem to affect much how VCs work with their portfolio, does make it a little more challenging than usual to make investment decisions. Mr. Huang said, for instance, it’s difficult to perform due diligence remotely, when one needs to go through a company’s financial statements.</p>

<p>Mr. Hsu from Ondine Capital recognizes the necessity of in-person meetings, noting that it’s “not just about meeting the startup founders but understanding how they work with others in the workplace.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in times of economic uncertainty, VC firms are also ramping up communication with their limited partners (LPs), from whom they raise capital for various funds. “Most LPs want to slow down and be careful,” IVP partner Mr. Huang said. “We also apply more scrutiny to the companies we invest.”</p>

<p>As a managing partner, Ms. Cheng said her team can give a second thought to companies in hard hit industries or markets, though they have been receiving phone calls as usual from startups pitching for investment. Recently, they have been working more closely with their LPs, too.</p>

<p>Mr. Hsu, instead, said he wouldn’t avoid funding companies working in the most affected B2C industries. “You still jump at it if there’s a good deal,” he said.</p>

<h2>Opportunities are emerging</h2>

<p>Besides B2B businesses based in China, Ondine Capital’s portfolio comprises B2C businesses based in Southeast Asia; many of them have been shut down, as the impact of fear over the disease has been widely perceived.</p>

<p>However, a consumer-facing startup like <a href="https://www.carsome.my/v3/?" title="https://www.carsome.my/v3/?">Carsome</a>, whose business involves staff visiting customers to check the car they want to sell on its trading platform, is still doing quite well because “it has enough cash in reserve and has just closed a funding round,” Mr. Hsu explained.</p>

<p>Cherubic Ventures’s Ms. Cheng said her portfolio companies working on healthcare, online learning (like <a href="https://hahow.in/" title="https://hahow.in/">Hahow</a>), e-commerce (like <a href="https://en.pinkoi.com/" title="https://en.pinkoi.com/">Pinkoi</a>), and even meditation (like <a href="https://www.calm.com/" title="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>) have noticed a business boom recently.</p>

<p>“Because of Covid-19, people start to pay more attention to their health, and this benefits healthcare startups,” she pointed out. “It would also be easier for them to fundraise.”</p>

<p>IVP’s Mr. Huang, optimistic about startups taking advantage of the situation, also told Business Next that <a href="https://www.buyandship.today/en/" title="https://www.buyandship.today/en/">Buyandship</a>, a portfolio company that provides global shipping services, has seen a 50% user growth so far since the outbreak started.</p>

<p>The VC firm invests mostly in Series A startups offering Internet-based services, so the impact of the virus has been either positive or subtle.</p>

<p>He believes the current situation will boost the growth of Internet industry and open up new opportunities for investments like ghost kitchen, food-preparation facilities that support virtual food brands. He also sees great growth potential in <a href="https://www.kiwibot.com/" title="https://www.kiwibot.com/">Kiwibot</a>, his firm’s portfolio company that offers robot delivery service.</p>

This ongoing influence leads us to continue to watch the next video that is recommended by the algorithm.</p><p>According to studies, about 78% of people are watching online videos every day in Taiwan, therefore the average time of watching is 1.6 hours per day. The thriving media industry is also bringing an increased demand for audio and visual equipment. The research institute, GHK, indicated that the first half of 2019, the global speakers and headphones market reached USD 8.7 billion. In this industry with a bright future, there is an acoustic design startup from Taiwan, that will undoubtedly blow our minds and show us the innovative technology of audio hardware design. The Taiwan-based startup - Sounds Great is founded by Mr. Chou, his classmates, and his instructor in college. Their core technology is using semiconductors and electromagnets to redesign traditional audio speakers. &nbsp;The team responded, &ldquo;Long story short, we will reduce the size of traditional speakers by 99%, whereas the volume is fifty times louder than before.&rdquo; Mr. Chou, the founder of Sounds Great, took out a coin from his pocket and spoke, &ldquo;just imagine that we put a boombox into this coin.&rdquo; &nbsp; Sounds Great and their core technology makes them stand out from a crowd, as they have also gained many acknowledgments from professionals as well as businesses. Sounds Great also got selected and awarded by the FITI innovation and startup program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>【It starts with an idea of bulletproof vest】&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/1de/8e8/42b/1de8e842bc7ac55dfc77bfe1aa3c783bca985499.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>(Picture 1: Sounds Great team picture)</p><p>Mr. Chou flashed back to his college life when he was an undergraduate majoring in Chemistry in FJCU. He found a high-strength fiber material in the lab and was pondering about how to commercialize this material. The initial idea that crossed his mind was &ldquo;I can use this fiber material to strengthen the bulletproof vest and it will save many soldier&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; As a result, Mr. Chou sent testing samples to a testing laboratory and waited for the feedback. The researcher of the testing laboratory showed them the outcome of the testing results and introduced a speaker diaphragm manufacturer, which was looking for a similar fiber material they made. Therefore, Sounds Great pivoted their bulletproof vest business idea to the game-changing acoustic material startup.</p><p><strong>【Early stage - money burning to survive in the winter of R&amp;D】</strong></p><p>The very beginning of startup life was a tough time. &nbsp;As a hardware startup is not like SaaS, software, and mobile app startup. The capital is burning for the salary, rent, equipment, testing materials and so forth. It wore out their passion and entrepreneur dream of this budding startup and suddenly brought them back to reality. Mr. Chou recalled their early stage. To gain more financial aids, Mr. Chou brought their proposal to meet with various investors, apply for government subsidies, and exhibit in startup expo. &nbsp;Then, Sounds Great received a wonderful chance to be chosen in the FITI program organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology and represented Taiwan startup to receive business training in Singapore for a month. In the early stage, they adjusted and restructured their business model from the opinions by mentors in Singapore. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>【External investment - the spring is around the corner】</strong></p><p>After burning the midnight oil day by day, Sounds Great has finally proved its core technology and collects enough experiment data. Recently, Sounds Great is a partner with the semiconductor market leader to start further steps of product-market fit. Mr. Chou showed the chairs in the office and said, &ldquo;we have some nice and comfortable chairs here because we seep at the office often.&rdquo; Sounds Great is a member of the STARTBOARD incubation program. The first investor meetup does not have any financial support, but that was an excellent experience for them to sharpen their pitch skills and business proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Entrepreneurship is hard, especially for the first couple of years; however, Sounds Great has developed a strong foundation for their business from previous failures. The student startup&ndash;Sounds Great has transformed and became more mature in both their mentality and product. Then, their pitch and business are receiving more and more helpful feedback from different pitch competitions and investors. Sounds Great was enduring through the winter of being an underdog and finally obtained the investor&rsquo;s monetary support and received a lot of public attention last year. This investment boosts the team and their product; Meanwhile, there are some global brands that see the potentiality of the innovation of audio devices.

<p>California native Alex Garcia moved to Taipei last year to live in a city he had enjoyed during his short stay as a visiting student at National Taiwan University. He told Business Next that he knew he wanted to come back, so after working for ridesharing company Lyft for two years, he boarded a plane that crosses the Pacific ocean and soon found himself re-exploring the Taiwanese capital by bicycle -- an integral part of the city’s public transport system.</p>

<p>Garcia praised Taipei for its developed infrastructure: subway and bus services are reliable and affordable, and “you can get anywhere in Taipei safely on a bike,” he said. “I want to live in a city where I can bike everywhere.”</p>

<p>Since 2009, the city of Taipei has been working with local manufacturer <a href="https://www.giantcyclingworld.com/" title="https://www.giantcyclingworld.com/">Giant</a> to offer a public bicycle rental service called Youbike; there are 13,000+ bicycles served by 400+ docking stations, many of which are outside subway stations.</p>

<p>He believes it makes the city an international hub for talent. “If people want to live here, it’s so easy to just come here,” he said. In Taipei, one can rely on public transport without investing in a car or bike.</p>

<p>As a person who enjoys walking, he also likes the walkability of the city. “Convenience stores and restaurants are within walking distance,” he said. “I don’t need to leave my area to go to the gym, doctor, pharmacy, [and so on.]” By contrast, in typical American cities, residents tend to spend some hours every day on travelling to and from different places, and there’s no way to reduce the amount of time spent on these trips unless they move to the downtown.</p>

<p>Working in the mobility sector, Garcia said he has been interested in “expanding transportation options that are sustainable and affordable.” During his two years at Lyft, he helped launch the bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area and build 400+ bike stations. Now in Taipei, he told Business Next that he hopes to help other cities develop a transportation system of the same quality. “I want to live in a place that lives the values that I\'m trying to help other cities have,” he explained, as the founder of transportation consulting firm <a href="https://taipeiurbanism.com/" title="https://taipeiurbanism.com">Taipei Urbanism</a>.</p>

<h2>As a gold card holder</h2>

<p>Launched two years ago, the Taiwan Employment Gold Card is part of a government initiative to attract highly-skilled foreign talent to Taiwan. The government has identified several key areas, under which qualified foreigners can apply for the Gold Card, like Science &amp; Technology, Economy, Finance, among others. They will be assessed under a set of specific requirements defined by the corresponding government agencies (such as the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and Ministry of Economic Affairs).</p>

<p><em>The card, valid for up to three years, puts together four crucial documents for foreigners to live and work in Taiwan: resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC; the card which proves the holder’s right to legally reside in Taiwan), multiple entry permit, and open work permit (it allows the holder to work for any employer(s) in Taiwan).</em></p>

<p>Garcia applied under the category of Economy and has just recently received his gold card. He said it’s the simplest option as all he needed to do is to verify that his income was above a certain threshold last year, though he hopes submitting the W-2 form that comes out once a year isn’t the only way to do so.</p>

<p>The card ensures him a stable home and health insurance in Taiwan for three years, and he doesn’t need to be sponsored for a regular employment visa by working for a local company. The open work permit gives him full flexibility to work on his project or for a Taiwanese company and any transition will be seamless.</p>

<p>Describing his mindset as “Asian,” he applauded that the gold card allows him to develop his business at a slower pace. “I can create company [in Taiwan] when I’m confident enough, when there’s enough clients, [and] when I can give someone a stable job,” he explained. In his hometown California, most companies, like Uber, don’t make a single cent for years, and “everyone thinks that\'s ok.” However, he believes only revenue pushes his business forward.</p>

<p>In Taipei Urbanism, he helps mobility companies from the US and Europe complete their proposal for transportation projects to be submitted to the government. He has also noticed a great interest in East and Southeast Asia from several clients. “I submit the work in a way that’s easy to look at for them to make a decision or get to the next step of the project,” he explained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he now works as a volunteer in the city government of Taipei; this allows him to learn from the local community and later apply the lessons to his work. Also, due to the nature of the industry he works in, it’s valuable for him to be close to the government.</p>

<p>In the future, he plans to create a Taiwanese branch for his company, which should make it easier for him to compete for government grants, for example, on energy transition and smart mobility. He’s also open to working with Taiwanese companies -- that are developing mobility solutions or manufacturing hardware products -- and helping them go global.</p>

<p>“There’s so much potential for Taiwan to be a big player in electric trams, buses, and batteries,” he said. For example, the southern city of Kaohsiung boasts the world’s first wire-free light rail system in which trams charge their batteries for around ten seconds at each stop to make it to the next. Electric buses are also <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014%20%22https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014" title="https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910080014 ">becoming more and more common</a> on the streets of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Jerome Shen, General Partner &amp; Head of Life Science Investments at Taiwania, believes it’s now the time for Taiwan to prepare for the economic recovery after the health crisis comes under control. “Taiwan should turn crisis into opportunity to stay ahead in the biotech industry in post-pandemic times,” he said.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017, <a href="https://www.taiwaniacapital.com/" title="https://www.taiwaniacapital.com/">Taiwania</a> is an early stage VC firm launched by the <a href="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=9F0C4DE5BC5FFEFD" title="https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=9F0C4DE5BC5FFEFD">National Development Fund of Taiwan</a> and private enterprises. It closed the second fund in 2018 with NTD$ 5.9 billion (US$ 200M) to invest in pharmaceutical product research and development, gene/cell therapy and medical technology, according to the firm’s site.</p>

<p>Taiwania\'s recent portfolio companies include <a href="https://regenacy.com/" title="https://regenacy.com/">Regenacy Pharmaceuticals</a>, a US-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough treatments for diabetic and other peripheral neuropathies, and <a href="http://www.pointroboticsinc.com/" title="http://www.pointroboticsinc.com/">Point Robotics</a>, a Taiwan-based medtech company developing a robot-assisted system for minimally invasive spine surgery.</p>

<p>As the coronavirus shakes the global economy, companies across various industries are likely to experience a precipitous drop in revenue. But for the biotech industry in particular, Mr. Shen pointed out that the economic fallout can be even more immense as the R&amp;D cost in this industry tends to be higher.</p>

<p>With medical resources largely allocated to fight against Covid-19, clinical trials for other treatments can be <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1172" title="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1172">suspended</a> or terminated; this temporary measure may lead to devastating outcome for patients around the world.</p>

<p>Lauded globally for their ability to contain the spread of the virus, Mr. Shen encourages Taiwanese medical institutions to evaluate their capabilities and what they can offer to the global community so as to attract multinational pharmaceutical giants to set up a base for clinical trials in Taiwan. He believes this should take Taiwan’s research capacity to the next level.</p>

<p>According to Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center, three local health institutions were cleared to <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003190017" title="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202003190017">participate in the clinical trials of the antiviral drug Remdesivir</a> for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, while official statistics show that at least 128 hospitals and medical institutions in Taiwan are eligible to perform these trials.</p>

Probably yes, and this is reasonable. We simply can’t afford to verify all the information we have access to. Even if we want to, it’s extremely difficult if not impossible for us to do so -- because there’s virtually no way to trace the source of, say, a picture or video.</p>

<p>In the meantime, most of us are aware that we live in an era of fake news. With malicious intent or not, individuals, organizations, and even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/17/spreading-fake-news-becomes-standard-practice-for-governments-across-the-world/">governments</a> are spreading misinformation to manipulate public opinion over social media platforms and beyond.</p>

<p>For example, on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Luk_Anikos/status/1064107115835531264" title="https://twitter.com/Luk_Anikos/status/1064107115835531264">a photo</a> of a scene at the "Je Suis Charlie" demonstration in 2015 was shared as evidence of the Yellow Vests taking to the streets to protest against a surge in oil price. Also, a video Donald Trump tweeted in which some thousands of protesters chant his name as they dodge tear gas in Paris turns out to be <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/12/08/falling-les-fake-news-trump-spreads-lie-french-protesters-chant-name/" title="https://theintercept.com/2018/12/08/falling-les-fake-news-trump-spreads-lie-french-protesters-chant-name/">a lie</a>.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, it’s not surprising to see a <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php" title="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trust-in-media-down.php">lack of trust</a> in media outlets around the world. Taiwan startup Numbers is launched in 2019 to tackle this issue. With blockchain, the team develops an app named Numbers Capture that is able to ensure the integrity of a digital image over its life cycle. “We’d like to rebuild people’s trust toward data,” the team told Business Next.</p>

<p>In a video conference, <a href="https://numbersprotocol.io/" title="https://numbersprotocol.io/">Numbers</a> team explained that the issue of trust has two aspects. From the perspective of the person who takes a picture (data producer), whether a random individual or journalist, they would not know if their photo is copied, misused, or edited and then re-published as it circulates on the Internet. Meanwhile, for those who use a picture (data consumer), there’s no guarantee that it’s the exact version produced by the original photographer instead of a photoshopped version.</p>

<p>In order for data to be trustworthy, it needs to be traceable, and for Numbers, this means that to “capture its source” and record it on the blockchain. Whenever a user takes a picture with their phone, the Numbers Capture app will hash its metadata (like when, where, how, and with what type of device the picture is taken) and other relevant data (like weather and temperature) in order to generate a digital footprint. It will later be encrypted and uploaded to the blockchain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the picture itself will be encrypted and stored on a distributed file system (InterPlanetary File System; IPFS); however, Numbers also offers the option for their clients to store their pictures on a private cloud, in case some shy away from keeping their data in a decentralized system.</p>

<p>A scenario for a user to utilize the app is when they provide a picture to news sites, co-founder Sophia Yen told Business Next. They will be able to prove that their material isn’t tampered with by granting access permission to the digital evidence previously recorded on the blockchain. In addition, an AI algorithm is implemented to help news sites verify the source.</p>

<p>Similarly, with Numbers’s service, a user can ensure their evidence is sufficiently reliable to be admitted at trial.</p>

<p>Ms. Yen pointed out one of the advantages of their product is that it’s more than a mobile app. Instead, it integrates with some Canon cameras so that photos taken with them can be rendered traceable, too.</p>

<p>The startup’s B2B model involves providing SDK for image source capturing, integrating the app with an existing storage system, and maintaining the entire system that allows users to record data and verify its integrity; they also plan to provide the service to end users like photographers, bloggers and Youtubers, who will be charged based on the number of pictures they take.</p>

<p>“We are ourselves data producers,” Mr. Yen said. “It’s vital that we know who uses our data and how it’s used.” She also recognized the necessity of educating the general public about the issue of data ownership and verifiability.</p>

<p>Currently, Numbers has been offering their service to international news sites (in the US and Europe), NGOs, war correspondents, and independent photographers. Their partners include hTC Exodus and Binance.</p>

<p>Ms. Yen told us the startup has taken the first step in combating fake news by making data traceable and verifiable, and the next step is to build a platform for users to trade and monetize their personal data.</p>

<p>With an app called DeMiner, developed by Midas Labs, Exodus 1S users are able to mine open-source cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) easily and cost-efficiently; that is, the app enables the smartphone to be comparable to regular desktop computers in terms of hashrate ability but consume far less electricity.</p>

<p>According to the startup, the app inactivates mining automatically when the phone is in regular use or isn’t plugged in. It will be available for download by the end of Q2, 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier, Midas Labs has raised a seed round led by <a href="https://proof.fund/" title="https://proof.fund/">Proof of Capital</a>, a blockchain-focused venture capital fund managed by Phil Chen, who leads the Exodus team for HTC as the Decentralized Chief Officer.</strong></p>

<p>The executive said the the dominance of giant mining pools threatens the crypto world. They pour a huge amount of computing power into the network so as to enjoy a greater probability to be given the opportunity to add a block into the chain and reap the rewards.</p>

<p>To him, making crypto mining accessible for everyone is the most effective way to change the status quo. By making the process cost-efficient, he believes the DeMiner app incentivizes individual miners to help decentralize the network.</p>

<p>Dr. Jri Lee, founder and CEO of Midas Labs and a professor at National Taiwan University said today, a typical laptop consumes around 65W of electricity -- which costs $0.16 -- to mine $0.04 worth of Monero per day, and the app is able to cut the cost by at least 50%.</p>

<p>Based in Taiwan, Midas Labs is an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design company specializing in blockchain mining and associated applications. Its unique “super hash engine” provides the world’s first re-programmable mining ASIC, a chip that supports dozens of hash algorithms.</p>

<p>Proof of Capital said it’s excited to work with the Midas Labs team, whose members are experienced experts in the IC industry. Believing that Asia is the global center of crypto mining, the firm is also confident about the market potential of the team’s innovation.</p>

The 28-year-old Taiwanese who started an anonymous social networking platform at the university is one of them.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.dcard.tw/f" title="https://www.dcard.tw/f">Dcard</a> co-founder Kytu Lin was named to the magazine’s newly released list of “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/under30/list/2019/asia/" title="https://www.forbes.com/under30/list/2019/asia/">30 Under 30 Asia</a>” in the Consumer Technology category. He’s the only Taiwanese honoree in this category.</p>

<p>In 2011, Lin launched Dcard as a matching-making site for university students where they gain access to a random user’s profile at 12 am every day; a match is made when they send a friend request to someone who also shows interest to connect.</p>

<p>Now, the social media platform is one of the most-visited websites in Taiwan, attracting more than 1.5 billion page views per month from university students who discuss their relationships, careers, and various hot topics with others anonymously or semi-anonymously. It’s said to have encouraged the young generation to participate in politics and <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2019/07/08/2003718298" title="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2019/07/08/2003718298">make their voice heard</a>.</p>

<p>Like Mark Zuckerberg, Lin began his entrepreneurial journey in late teens and has reached a milestone that only few others can. However, he told Business Next that looking back at the years, he has never thought about his title of entrepreneur. “You are an entrepreneur once you take action,” he said.</p>

<p>As a new 30 under 30 honoree, this young entrepreneur shared with Business Next his experience of starting a business in the prime of his life. His words have been slightly edited for brevity.</p>

<p><strong>Spending your youth running a startup, what have you sacrificed?</strong></p>

<p>"I\'ve learned so much from the experience that I don\'t think I\'ve sacrificed anything for it. There are not only challenges ahead but also a great opportunity to learn and think about how to lead a better life. Plus, the startup allows me to build wealth and gain a sense of accomplishment and mission. It’s hard to say I’ve made any sacrifice."</p>

<p><strong>What are the challenges and opportunities faced by entrepreneurs in their twenties?</strong></p>

<p>"Starting a company comes with a lot of pressure. It’s difficult to distinguish whether it’s due to a lack of experience. However, I do believe we need to overcome such lack of experience through reading extensively and learning from those who have the experience we need. I’m optimistic about young entrepreneurs, who are able to learn fast and as blank slates."</p>

<p><strong>During these years running a startup, have you thought about giving up? What makes you who you are today?</strong></p>

<p>"Yes, I’ve thought about giving up. At the lowest point of my life, I turned to biographies of CEOs and founders of great companies, such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, and realized that they have all been through the same time in their life. I also learned that you need to face your fears in order to grow, and after the biggest difficulty comes the biggest breakthrough in life."</p>

<p>"There are two reasons why I didn’t give up. First, I have a big dream to achieve. Also, I’ve received support from so many people. They’ve been with me through good and bad times and I hope to give back someday."</p>

<p><strong>If you could make the decision again, would you choose to start your journey as an entrepreneur in the second year of university?</strong></p>

<p>"If I had the chance, I would not only make the same decision but start the journey as early as possible. However, I normally don’t encourage students to start their own business. A true entrepreneur is one who doesn’t give up even if the world tells them to."</p>

<p><strong>What is work–life balance for you as an entrepreneur?</strong></p>

<p>"I’ve never tried to achieve work-life balance since balance means separation to me. Every life experience helps me make better decisions at work. Plus, it’s hard for me not to think about work when I’m off work."</p>

<p>This week, Taiwan-based restaurant tech startup <a href="https://www.ichefpos.com/" title="https://www.ichefpos.com/">iCHEF</a> announced <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46338" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46338">collaboration with KGI Bank</a>, one of the many banks who apply for the relief loans offered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on behalf of businesses who see a 15% decline in revenue for two consecutive months.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, over the four-day holiday in early April, revenue for restaurants in five major municipalities has declined by 23%, according to <a href="https://www.foodnext.net/news/newstrack/paper/5111437815" title="https://www.foodnext.net/news/newstrack/paper/5111437815">foodnext</a>.</p>

<p>For iCHEF, the collaboration entails giving the bank access to the data on its platform. Then, KGI Bank is able to examine the financial health of the restaurants using iCHEF\'s POS device and help them apply for the government lending program without requesting them to submit documents that prove a negative growth in revenue.</p>

<p>The streamlined process should benefit those who suffer less severe decline in revenue and thus aren’t qualified as a beneficiary of the coronavirus relief.</p>

<p>Restaurants with NT$5M annual revenue can now submit loan application to KGI Bank directly through iCHEF’s system and, if approved, receive a three-year emergency installment loan <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844" title="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844">worth up to NT$1M</a> within five days. Also, personal loans will soon be available to restaurant owners making $200k revenue every month; they can expect to receive up to NT$450k at a preferable interest rate within three days.</p>

<p>KGI Bank estimates that these two plans should help 5,000 and 6,000 restaurants, respectively, <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844" title="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5613/4497844">Economy Daily News</a> said.</p>

<p>“We know it’s been a tough time for small restaurant owners,” said iCHEF co-founder Ken Chen. “Therefore, we not only hope to make technology accessible to them but provide loan programs that will help them survive.”</p>

<p>iCHEF develops a POS system to help restaurant owners increase their revenue through data analytics. Founded in 2012, it has provided the service more than 6,000 restaurants around Asia, in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.</p>

<p>The Taiwanese company usually provides an iPad for restaurant owners and charges a fixed fee (US$100/month) for access to its data analytics platform. However, in response to the crisis faced by restaurant owners, iCHEF has rolled out a new pricing model where users are charged based on how heavily they use its service every month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company has waived the monthly subscription fee for around 60,000 small restaurants in Taiwan and Hong Kong. This measure applies to new clients, too.</p>

<p>The NDF is the investment arm of the National Development Council (NDC), the policy-planning agency of the executive branch of the central government.</p>

<p><strong>With NT$560 billion under management, NDF plans to offer six to twelve months of funding in exchange for preferred stock; it doesn’t give shareholders the right to vote on company policies and decisions.</strong></p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.df.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=D46464AD1E4F9017" title="https://www.df.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=D46464AD1E4F9017">official page</a>, all startup companies affected by the COVID-19 crisis are eligible to apply for the program, if they’re owned by Taiwanese or based in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Applicants must spell out why they qualify as a startup, how their business is impacted, and how funds will be used if granted to them. They also need to provide the conditions for issuing the stock and explain how they want to redeem the stock.</p>

<p>In principle, the NDC says the stock should be redeemed in two years, but conversion to common stock is also an option.</p>

<p>NDC Minister Chen Mei-ling says despite many ways to define what a startup is, innovation in business model is the key determinant of whether the council considers a company to be a startup.</p>

<p>Bryan Huang, attorney at Taipei Law, adds that companies registered overseas must state in the application that their principal place of business is in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Startup companies should submit applications during a period of six months, from April to September. But an extension is possible if the outlook for the global economy continues to worsen.</p>

<p>To ensure that companies receive funding within a month, the NDC says it accepts applications on a rolling basis, reviewing each application as it arrives.</p>

<p>The council also permits startups who have benefited from the program to apply for the stimulus loans offered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and public banks.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier this month, the central government announced a stimulus package <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan-economy/taiwan-hopes-35-billion-stimulus-package-will-be-enough-against-coronavirus-idUSKBN21K0CU" title="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan-economy/taiwan-hopes-35-billion-stimulus-package-will-be-enough-against-coronavirus-idUSKBN21K0CU">worth NT$1.05 trillion</a> to cushion the economy from coronavirus fallout</strong>, and according to Premier Su Tseng-chang, it’s possible that the government makes it a bigger one if the viral disease continues to spread around the globe.</p>

<p>A number of stimulus provisions, from funds to loans, are aimed at helping SMEs across industries hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic: service, tourism, retail, restaurant, and manufacturing. Premier Su says the government has reached a consensus with banks on speeding up the process of reviewing loan applications.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has also cut interest rates for companies and ordered banks to defer the repayments on existing personal or business loans.</p>

<p>To prevent mass layoffs, the Ministries of Labor, Finance, and Economic Affairs help subsidize employee training. They will also cover the expenses of organizing training sessions as well.</p>

It goes without saying that we should continue to work on killing the virus, identifying the virus (with test kits and equipments), and treating the infected.</p>

<p>Professor Jason Wang from Stanford University, whose journal article on Taiwan’s response to COVID-19 has garnered international attention, also joined the event to chart the path forward toward a post-pandemic future while highlighting the importance of understanding “where we are now” as a global community.</p>

<p>Taiwan has done an incredible job in containing the spread of the virus and therefore has never seen the necessity to implement mitigation measures like city-wide lockdowns, Wang said. In many parts of the world, however, governments are struggling to flatten the curve, keeping people at home or staying away from each other in public spaces. As these measures harm the economy, they are also considering easing the lockdown, but it remains a question if they can prevent a second wave of infections.</p>

<p>To respond to these challenges, Prof. Wang raised a series of questions: “how much viral load matters for infectivity, how many different types of tests are out there, and how do we do contact tracing and follow-up care at a massive scale now.” It’s only from knowing the answers to these questions can we start to think about solutions, or “find problems worth solving.”</p>

<p>For example, having a clear picture about the wide range of existing test kits, one may go about comparing their levels of sensitivity, specificity, and costs and make testing more accurate and efficient.</p>

<p>As a professor at the School of Medicine, he also called for a better understanding of the biology of the virus disease and its symptoms to be able to produce therapeutics and vaccines. “Are you prevent the binding of the virus [to the cell], disrupt the replication of the virus, or prevent the virus from going out of the cell?” These are all opportunities to tap into, he said, as the world works on the most urgently needed solution.</p>

<p>Overall, he believes it’s most valuable now to “develop an integrated tech package for contact tracing and follow up care” for those seeking solutions to do “plug and play,” and come up with strategies to scale and deliver them to the customers. Ultimately, he expects an “integrated and secure platform” that could put together various solutions that make it to the market.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as mitigation measures, like lockdown and social distancing, hit the most vulnerable in the society, Prof. Wang also encouraged entrepreneurs come in and offer solutions.</p>

<p>Techstars’s pre-event has attracted a great number of non-Taiwanese, who are interested to learn about the nation’s success in containing the virus and keeping the economy running. Mr. Chen, the head of the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology (MOST), explained that this is because Taiwan is well-prepared for an epidemic, proactive in tackling the virus, and quick to adapt new technologies, including the monitoring system described as <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3912429" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3912429">digital fence</a>.</p>

<p>His ministry, notably, has been funding over 300 science labs all around the island since the SARS pandemic, and the discussion on the novel coronavirus has started among medical experts and doctors way before the first case of infection was confirmed.</p>

<p>More broadly, Taiwan is no stranger to disasters, he said. Frequently hit by earthquakes, typhoons, and flooding, Taiwanese citizens are used to taking action in an emergency, such as following <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004030007" title="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202004030007">orders to wear a mask on public transport</a>.</p>

<p>With flexible regulations in disaster management, the government is also able to respond timely to a sudden crisis; for example, in early April, when visitors were flocking to several tourist attractions during the holiday, the Center for Disaster Reduction under MOST sent a text alert to their phone, asking them to wear a mask and keep distance with other people.</p>

<p>As one of the few countries in the world where the situation is contained, Prof. Wang said there is great opportunity for Taiwan to export its solutions to help developing countries and allies weather the crisis.</p>

In the 54-hour hackathon, 133 participants came together and formed 39 projects to tackle various challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The event attracted participants from all walks of life -- engineers, UI/X designers, medical school students, marketing specialists, AI researchers, data science experts, and startup founders -- and all around the world, from Taiwan, the US, Australia, Japan, Belgium, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>The Online Startup Weekend followed a live-streamed pre-event where Minister of Science &amp; Technology Chen Liang-Gee and Jason Wang, Professor from the Center for Policy Outcomes and Prevention at Stanford University, talked about the lessons from Taiwan in containing the coronavirus and <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46368" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46368">how entrepreneurs can jump in</a> to contribute to the global community with their innovation.</p>

<p>On Sunday (4/26), the last day of the hackathon, a total of eight teams pitched to a jury of 20 mentors one after another; they selected the final three to be awarded with cash prize, provided by the Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency (ASVDA), Taiwania Capital, and KPMG Taiwan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.physioq.org/neo" title="https://www.physioq.org/neo">Neo</a> won the first place with its self-monitoring technology for health. Chris Peng, the leader of the team, said the idea of the project is twofold: with connected wearable devices, they help families track the health of their loved ones; medical institutes can also use the product to monitor the health of patients in quarantine. For the team, the ultimate goal is to build an extensive database that supports and accelerates COVID-19 research.</p>

<p>ChanceCake and MyLog, respectively, earned the second- and third-place awards. The former develops a jobs platform that helps those who have gone unemployed due to the coronavirus crisis find remote jobs that suit them, and the latter builds an open data platform that allows citizens to record their own symptoms of the virus disease and receive reward for their contribution.</p>

<p>Other teams included CoTrace, who develops an app that verifies the sources of medical supplies like masks and ventilators, Lucky 7, who builds an online platform that matches counseling psychologists with those who suffer from mental health issues due to COVID-19, and Project Proactive, a team that uses voice recognition technology to help the elderly report their health condition.</p>

In Taiwan, for example, CVC business units and firms have participated in 52% of all the deals made for the past five years, according to <a href="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/" title="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/">Taiwania Capital</a>’s report.</p>

<p>Based in San Francisco Bay Area, <a href="https://msad.vc/" title="https://msad.vc/">MS&amp;AD Ventures</a> is a CVC firm of MS&amp;AD Insurance Group Holdings, a Japanese insurance company that operates in 47 countries around the world. With 120M fund under management, the firm invests in early-stage startup companies across continents and industry verticals, from fintech, AI, to cybersecurity.</p>

<p>While many CVC investors shy away from backing young startups, MS&amp;AD Ventures have had 32 companies in portfolio and seeks to invest more; these companies hail from the US, Germany, Israel, Singapore, and so on. To explain their strategy, Tiffine Wang, partner for the CVC firm, told Business Next that they bet on “what’s going to happen in three to seven years from now.”</p>

<p>Their parent company is aware that innovation shouldn’t only be incremental -- a series of minor improvements to existing products -- but also disruptive. “I invest in a company I think is going to kill my portfolio company,” she chuckled.</p>

<p>MS&amp;AD Ventures has a team of business development leads that source technologies to be implement into business units in the next six to twelve months. On the investment side, the decision making sits with the three partners, who focuses on disruptive models.</p>

<p>This is just one of the many features that make Ms. Wang’s firm unconventional. Others include the ability to make an investment decision within two weeks, though it usually entails a series of evaluations and negotiations.</p>

<p>“Our team, especially from the investment side, is known for being agile,” she said. “We stand on top of things about moving fast, and that’s what we pride ourselves on doing because we want to be mindful of how entrepreneurs are treated.”</p>

<p>The pandemic has slightly slowed down the process, but she said it’s because they have been helping portfolio companies revamp their plan to ensure they have enough cash runway of 12 to 18 months.</p>

<p>She believes now it’s a great time for investors to bet on early stage startups, as they may focus on building a product in the time of economic downturn and be ready to launch it when the crisis comes under control.</p>

<h2>We want them to come to us when something is wrong</h2>

<p>Like her other partners, Ms. Wang had been working with entrepreneurs for years before moving into the VC space. She has built incubator and accelerator programs to help talent with technical background start their own business, including the <a href="https://alchemistaccelerator.com/" title="https://alchemistaccelerator.com/">Alchemist Accelerator</a>, and most recently, worked for Singaporean holdings company Singtel on innovation and venture investment.</p>

</figure>

<p>Because of their experience, she said they try to be respectful and responsive to entrepreneurs. “We want them to come to us when something is wrong...because we can help them manage it,” Ms. Wang said.</p>

<p>With educational background in psychology, she has a unique perspective about how to coach startups and entrepreneurs. “As a case manager, you don’t go in there with an idea about what this person is gonna say or do,” she said.</p>

<p>She and her team lead and guide entrepreneurs to grow and expand globally -- without telling them explicitly how to achieve it. Instead, they aim to be a resource for their entrepreneurs, introducing them to other VCs, customers, and a “holistic perspective” about how to run a global business.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, she said, most problems in a startup team are people problems; this is, again where her knowledge in psychology comes in handy. She described what she would do for them as a “massage.”</p>

<p>Speaking of investment strategy, Ms. Wang explained that her team tends to follow instead of leading a deal -- because they try to avoid sending signals to other companies. “We don’t want to say this company is our company and no one else can work with them.”</p>

<p>While many CVCs who may prefer exclusive deals, she said her team seeks to be part of the ecosystem and open up as many new opportunities for their companies as possible. However, it’s still possible that they lead a funding round if their relationship with the startup team “clicks.”</p>

<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79="34402" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79="1" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79="34402" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79="100">Growing presence in Taiwan</h2>

<p>As she manages portfolio companies spread all over the world, Ms. Wang has been visiting Taiwan in search of VCs to co-invest with. At the moment, she said she’s still learning from the ecosystem from Taiwanese VCs and some others from Singapore who having been talking about Taiwan.</p>

<p>Alongside traditional CVCs, there are several younger emerging managers in Taiwan that are operating more like a global VC like her, and this is a great opportunity for the country if their global perspective turns into part of its culture.</p>

<p>“It’s not about Taiwan become Silicon Valley or Israel, but about Taiwan becoming fully Taiwan,” she said. “You have to take all the things you’ve learned from all over the world and turn it into the Taiwan DNA and make that successful.”</p>

<p>Ms. Wang took herself as an example of continuous learning: it’s only spending enough time at Singtel did she become well-versed in the telecom industry. She encouraged Taiwanese founders to go and learn from the companies in the ecosystem where their industry is thriving.</p>

<p>For example, “if you’re building a security company, it’s wise to spend some time in Israel, meeting the entrepreneurs who are part of the ecosystem,” she said.</p>

<p>In the meantime, she stressed that Taiwan should keep working on what it’s been good at, such as healthcare and hardware design, and “do it in a way that no one else can do it.”</p>

<blockquote>

	<p><strong>“I don\'t want to invest in the Taiwanese version of Uber,” she asserted. “I want to invest in something I can only find in Taiwan, so the world comes to Taiwan to find this thing.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ms. Wang believes Taiwan has the potential to stand out on the world stage, but founders have to be committed to building technologies that can scale globally. With a great talent pool, Taiwan should dare to take bigger risks and go after big ideas, she concluded.</p>

<p>Before moving to Taiwan, an Italian had gone through several stages of his life in China: he first went to Shanghai to study engineering, started a company that builds a platform for second hand goods trading, and later worked as an analyst for Chinaccelerator and SOSV, the venture capital firm that backs the program.</p>

<p>Marco Mirabella told Business Next that he visited Taiwan for the first time for work and the idea of relocation soon began to grow in his mind. “Taiwan is like a hidden gem in Asia,” he said, noting that it’s an island of impressive natural landscape, friendly people, and the best quality of life for expats.</p>

<p>Therefore, after returning to China, he asked to transfer to the team at the <a href="https://mobileonlyx.com/" title="https://mobileonlyx.com/">Mobile Only Accelerator</a> (MOX) in Taipei, another accelerator operated by SOSV, and started his new life in Taiwan, which is no short of surprising turns of events.</p>

<h2>Journey as a tech entrepreneur in Taiwan</h2>

<p>In 2017, while working on business development and partnership expansion at MOX, he met two crypto curious entrepreneurs and a university professor, with whom he would later co-found <a href="https://cartesi.io/" title="https://cartesi.io/">Cartesi</a> to build a Linux infrastructure for scalable decentralized apps. The startup, notably, has recently released <a href="https://creepts.cartesi.io/en/" title="https://creepts.cartesi.io/en/">Creepts</a>, an app they claim to be the first fully decentralized game on Linux.</p>

<p>In the same year, Mirabella also met Kevin Yen of <a href="https://biggo.com.tw/" title="https://biggo.com.tw/">BigGo</a>, CEO of a MOX portfolio company that he managed. In January 2020, BigGo’s search engine, which allows customers to compare prices of products from various sellers and enjoy cashback rewards, is <a href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/TW" title="https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/TW">ranked as the 31th most visited website in Taiwan</a>.</p>

<p>He said he would make phone calls with Yen every week to discuss business strategies, and it was him who advised the CEO to break new ground by adding cash back feature to his price comparison website. This proved to be a success, with around two millions users in Taiwan now benefiting from this service every month.</p>

<p>It wasn’t surprising that Yen later offered him to work as the Chief Strategy Officer for BigGo. “He told me that ‘we need someone that does what you do,’” Mirabella recalled. In fact, the opportunity to transfer to a new position couldn’t have come more timely, as he had been struggling to contribute to the startup he co-founded in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Since the day he came on board, the Taiwanese company has been embracing a series of changes -- streamlining operations to expand to as many countries as possible, he said. The company has gained traction in Japan and Thailand, and now, they’re moving on to Indonesia and Italy.</p>

<p>“We are one of the few consumer-facing software companies going global from Taiwan,” he claimed, “and we are proud of that.”</p>

<p>As COVID-19 forces people to stay at home and shop online, BigGo has seen the number of its monthly users grow from 13 to 14.3M, Mirabella said. With greater efforts to expand into new markets, the company expects to “double or even triple the number.”</p>

<p>Besides growth, he is also keen on turning BigGo into a global company. He has been offering training sessions for employees in English and most recently, promoting a shift to remote work to attract foreign talent.</p>

<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79="49904" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79="1" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79="49904" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79="100">Encounter with a cohesive community for entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>Mirabella came to Taiwan four years ago and since then, has been active in the startup space. He is also one of the early applicants for the Taiwan Employment Gold Card, a government initiative to attract highly-skilled foreign talent to Taiwan.</p>

<p>The card, valid for up to three years, puts together four crucial documents for foreigners to live and work in Taiwan: resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC; the card which proves the holder’s right to legally reside in Taiwan), multiple entry permit, and open work permit.</p>

<p>The government has identified several key areas, under which qualified foreigners can apply for the Gold Card, like Science &amp; Technology, Economy, Finance, among others. They will be assessed under a set of specific requirements defined by the corresponding government agencies (such as the Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and Ministry of Economic Affairs).</p>

<p>With experience of running a tech startup and endorsement from MOX and Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA), Mirabella said it wasn’t difficult for him to “prove that his skills benefit Taiwan” and apply for the gold card under the category of Technology.</p>

<p>He described the startup community in Taiwan as “small but cohesive.” Being part of the community means receiving support from not only organizations like TTA but effectively, everyone, he said. This is also the reason why he believes it may be easier to apply for the card from Taiwan.</p>

<p>In addition, he appreciates the National Development Council (NDC)’s efforts in building up a community for Gold Card holders by organizing meetups on a regular basis, where they share their experience of living and working in Taiwan and have direct conversation with policy makers. It’s also nice to meet people from various backgrounds, he said.</p>

<p>However, as an entrepreneur, he believes there are several issues that Taiwan should work on to enable the startup ecosystem to thrive. For example, the government should simplify the process of opening a company to attract foreign startups to come to Taiwan.</p>

<p>If they come to Taiwan in great numbers, he said, then investors will start to see Taiwan and the gap of early stage funding can possibly be filled. “It’s a chicken-egg problem.”</p>

<p>Taiwan has the potential to become a international hub for talent and startups, and it has been working toward unleashing it. Initiatives like the Taiwan Employment Gold Card and <a href="https://ltl-taiwan.com/taiwan-entrepreneur-visa/" title="https://ltl-taiwan.com/taiwan-entrepreneur-visa/">Entrepreneur Visa</a> are both part of the efforts.</p>

<p>“At international startup events, I feel like I represent not only my company but Taiwan,” he said.</p>

<p>When asked why he decided to settle down in Taiwan, he said he usually turns the question around and asks “Why not Taiwan.” Having stayed in Taiwan for four years, he now plans to stay for an indefinite period of time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.physioq.org/" title="https://www.physioq.org/">PhysioQ</a> builds a software that helps researchers manage clinical trials with multiple participants outside the lab setting, and it has recently launched a new system called <a href="https://physioq.org/neo" title="https://physioq.org/neo">Neo</a> to support COVID-19 research.</p>

<p>The system collects health data from wearable devices, including temperature, heart rate, and activities (exercise and sleep), and users can choose to opt in to donate these data to help medical researchers study the coronavirus and figure out how to treat it effectively.</p>

<p>“We aren’t looking for a vaccine,” Chris Peng, co-founder of PhysioQ, told Business Next. “What we are looking at is really how the disease progresses, how we detect it early on, which symptoms are important, and so on.”</p>

<p>The data from users will be anonymized -- stripped of personally identifiable information like name and age -- and aggregated into a massive database. All researchers are eligible to apply for free access as long as their research is compliant with regulations and institutional policies. Several scientists from UC San Diego and Harvard University have already been using this database for COVID-19 research.</p>

<p>With the same data, Neo also helps families monitor their health in real time. Based in Taipei, Peng said the system enables him to track the health of his family members living in the US at any time without making phone calls. To be precise, it analyzes the data and sends signals when a family member is sick or possibly infected with COVID-19.</p>

<p>For instance, if the pattern how a person’s blood oxygen drops is similar to that of other people with the virus, then it’s sufficient to say he/she is infected.</p>

<p>In comparison, the temperature gun widely used to screen for the coronavirus is highly unreliable, he said. “The mass majority of people who have a fever don’t have COVID-19.” By launching Neo, his team hopes to create new standards to detect the infected.</p>

<p>Within a month, 200 families from 15 countries have signed up for early access of the service. It will be open to everyone by the end of the next week (May 15).</p>

<p>They may use compatible devices, including Garmin wristbands and smartwatches and Polar heart rate sensors, or manually input their data into the system for this service. Invalid data will be flagged for removal.</p>

<p>With Neo, PhysioQ won the first prize earlier last week in the <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46382" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46382">Global Online Startup Weekend in Taipei</a>, a 54-hour hackathon event where entrepreneurs and innovators came together to tackle the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship does often lend itself to the question of ‘what if’ leaning a business away from its initially steered direction toward the ideal. It’s compelling to imagine what the world would look like today if either W.

<p>Ann Chen the entrepreneur is merely one of four Ann Chens. She is one of the Olympic gold medalists in history, TV host, and by all accounts, hardly less remarkable as an author.

<p>For in an eerie way, the soap ideas each entrepreneur left us seems complete, as though nothing more left to be said. It is difficult to imagine soap going beyond cleanliness or skin-nourishing, difficult to imagine soap going beyond the chemical reaction between lye and oil ingredients. Ask yourself: What more could we have expected from a bar of soap?</p>

<p><strong>[The Social Entrepreneurship]</strong></p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Peter Drucker defined the social enterprise as any business creation that does not only pursue financial objectives and profitability but mainly a certain social change. According to Digital Minister Audrey Tang, diverse forms of social innovation have been developed in Taiwan in the past 20+ years, tackling a wide range of social issues. This leads to a culture shift in redefining success: The success of a social enterprise is the success of ALL involved.</p>

<p><em>The nearly-expired cooking oil can do a lot of good- Ann Chen (24<sup>th</sup> April 2020)</em></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>In 2017 alone, 12,000 tons of waste cooking oil (WCO) are discarded in Taiwan. The nearly-expired oil is under the umbrella of the WCO- to this, Chen asks, “Are we really discarding that much of WCO at the expense of other people who do not have anything?” Due to its chemical composition, recycling WCO seems the most cost-effective option as it contributes to a growing negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, vapor explosion, to name a few.</p>

	<br>
</p>

<p><strong>[The Sustainable Soap Project]</strong></p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>With all these considerations in mind, Chen initiated <em>The Sustainable Soap Project</em>. The objective of this project is to maximize the utility and value of the nearly-expired cooking oils across Taiwan. Instead of ending up in landfills, Chen desires to reuse the nearly-expired oils and transform them into scrumptious-smelling soaps. Meanwhile, all soaps are free of packaging to embrace the spirit of zero-waste. Chen’s first company has been so successful. It inspired her to start a series of handmade soap workshop events for the disabled group, availing them to become business leaders of their community.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Ann Chen is always trying her very best to help people around her. The fragrance of home-made soaps is not only because of aroma of flowers but also with the positive impact of social innovation and SDGs. &nbsp;Ann Chen sets an amazing example for female entrepreneurs, athletes and social innovation advocates. The Olympic gold medalists does not stop her becoming the best herself, neither does the title of business owner. Now, Ann Chen is ready for the next match which is fighting against pollution and waste. No matter who is going to win this match, Ann deserves our respect and applause because she is fighting for each of us and our mother nature.</p>

When Chen joined the STARTBOARD incubation program, she already knew what she wanted. &nbsp;Sitting around the meeting table one late Friday evening, Chen and Mason Lin (STARTBOARD&rsquo;s Project Manager) were discussing the details and direction to transform her vision into reality- The Sustainable Soap.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/395/7e6/3ff/3957e63ff727d91713987cf7e4e45d77b8becf70.jpg" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>Ann Chen was sharing the vision of her ideal startup with Mason Lin during the mentoring session.</p><p>For in an eerie way, the soap ideas each entrepreneur left us seems complete, as though nothing more left to be said. It is difficult to imagine soap going beyond cleanliness or skin-nourishing, difficult to imagine soap going beyond the chemical reaction between lye and oil ingredients. Ask yourself: What more could we have expected from a bar of soap?</p><p><strong>[The Social Entrepreneurship]</strong></p><p>Peter Drucker defined the social enterprise as any business creation that does not only pursue financial objectives and profitability but mainly a certain social change. According to Digital Minister Audrey Tang, diverse forms of social innovation have been developed in Taiwan in the past 20+ years, tackling a wide range of social issues. This leads to a culture shift in redefining success: The success of a social enterprise is the success of ALL involved.</p><p><em>The nearly-expired cooking oil can do a lot of good- Ann Chen (24<sup>th</sup> April 2020)</em></p><p>In 2017 alone, 12,000 tons of waste cooking oil (WCO) are discarded in Taiwan. The nearly-expired oil is under the umbrella of the WCO- to this, Chen asks, &ldquo;Are we really discarding that much of WCO at the expense of other people who do not have anything?&rdquo; Due to its chemical composition, recycling WCO seems the most cost-effective option as it contributes to a growing negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, vapor explosion, to name a few.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/4c3/867/258/4c38672589b34069c0efbb7aeaa8acc64bc370f0.jpg" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>(Picture: Soap)</p><p><strong>[The Sustainable Soap Project]</strong></p><p>With all these considerations in mind, Chen initiated <em>The Sustainable Soap Project</em>. The objective of this project is to maximize the utility and value of the nearly-expired cooking oils across Taiwan. Instead of ending up in landfills, Chen desires to reuse the nearly-expired oils and transform them into scrumptious-smelling soaps. Meanwhile, all soaps are free of packaging to embrace the spirit of zero-waste. Chen&rsquo;s first company has been so successful. It inspired her to start a series of handmade soap workshop events for the disabled group, availing them to become business leaders of their community.</p><p>Ann Chen is always trying her very best to help people around her. The fragrance of home-made soaps is not only because of aroma of flowers but also with the positive impact of social innovation and SDGs. &nbsp;Ann Chen sets an amazing example for female entrepreneurs, athletes and social innovation advocates. The Olympic gold medalists does not stop her becoming the best herself, neither does the title of business owner. Now, Ann Chen is ready for the next match which is fighting against pollution and waste. No matter who is going to win this match, Ann deserves our respect and applause because she is fighting for each of us and our mother nature.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c0f/4f9/105/c0f4f91056629f5f65ffbe6f8252643ae77744a5.jpg" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>(Group Picture STARTBOARD team and Ann Chen)</p><p>Written by Annjil Chong<br>Edited by Mason Ching-Yen Lin</p><p><br></p>', '5eb/4da/f06/5eb4daf068dab210200705.jpg', 1, '2020-05-08 04:09:46', '2024-09-01 22:06:34', null);

	<a href="https://picsee.co/" title="https://picsee.co/"></a>, a Martech startup based in Taiwan, announced last week that it has raised a $1 million Pre-A round led by <a href="https://www.hiveventures.io/" title="https://www.hiveventures.io/">Hive Ventures</a>, a seed to early stage VC. The National Development Fund (NDF) of Taiwan, which manages a NT$2 billion ($67 million) angel fund, also participated.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, PicSee is known for its URL shortener that allows marketers to optimize the ads they share across social media channels and measure campaign performance. On average, the site attracts 100 million visits per month -- from online businesses and social media influencers.</p>

<p>With the new funding, PicSee plans to expand the presence of its solution in Southeast Asia. The startup says it has been doing so in Vietnam and Thailand, and the traffic from these two countries has grown so significantly that it overtook that from Taiwan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, PicSee has been growing in Taiwan. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a 60% increase in the use of its link shortener since the beginning of the year, and more and more companies are showing interest in the solution, including retailers who are moving their brick-and-mortar businesses online or ramping up their efforts in digital marketing, says co-founder Wu Cheng-ho.</p>

<p>Companies have seen the benefit of using customized, shortened URLs in the time when customers are deeply suspicious of random links in an email or SMS message, according to co-founder Ray Wei. PicSee’s clients now include banks, e-commerce sites like Shopee and Taobao, as well as Eslite, one of the largest bookstore chains in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Using shortened links increases click through rate by more than 30%, according PicSee’s press statement. But Wu says providing these links is only part of what they offer to their clients.</p>

<p>He says PicSee is building a data analytics platform that tells marketers what brands fans follow on social media, what they consume on the Internet, and even gives suggestions about whom to build co-branding partnerships with.</p>

<p>Yan Lee, founder and managing partner of Hive Ventures, says PicSee helps companies open up the black box of data analytics controlled by social media giants and give it back to the content producer.</p>

<p>While focusing on taking such capability to the next level, PicSee hopes to work with other Taiwanese Martech companies and explore the Southeast Asian market together.</p>

	<a href="https://www.m17.asia/en" title="https://www.m17.asia/en"></a>(M17), a social media startup founded in Taiwan, announced yesterday (May 12) that it has raised a $26.5 million Series D, which will allow the company to not only grow in Taiwan and Japan but also expand into the US and emerging markets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vertexgrowth.com/" title="https://www.vertexgrowth.com/">Vertex Growth Fund</a>, a growth stage VC based in Singapore, is the lead investor. Stonebridge Ventures from South Korea, Innoven Capital from Singapore, Kaga Electronics from Japan, and ASE Global Group from the US also participated in the funding round.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017, M17 is the holding company for live streaming apps <a href="https://17.live/" title="https://17.live/">17 Live</a> (or <a href="https://www.wearelivit.com/" title="https://www.wearelivit.com/">Livit</a> in English speaking markets) and Meme Live, business-to-business live commerce service HandsUP, and artist agency Unicorn Entertainment.</p>

<p>Since this year, dating apps <a href="https://www.gopaktor.com/" title="https://www.gopaktor.com/">Paktor</a> and Goodnight aren\'t part of the M17 Group anymore, according to a <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46439" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46439">Business Next</a> report. After this structural change, the group says it aims to focus entirely on its live streaming business, which accounts for 91.4% of the overall revenue.</p>

<p>CEO Joseph Phua says what M17 provides is “a virtual stage for performers to explore what is possible both artistically and financially." That is, it allows them to "showcase their talent and interact directly with fans everywhere in real-time” to receive rewards.</p>

<p>The startup now holds 60% share in the live streaming market in Taiwan and Japan, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/m17-entertainment-limited-announces-us26-5-million-in-series-d-funding-301056388.html" title="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/m17-entertainment-limited-announces-us26-5-million-in-series-d-funding-301056388.html">press statement</a>. In Japan, it claims to be the largest “pure-play” video live streaming company.</p>

<p>Last year, M17 <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/m17-acquires-meme-live" title="https://www.techinasia.com/m17-acquires-meme-live">acquired Meme Live</a>, a live streaming platform focusing on APAC markets, including India and Southeast Asia, to bring its market share in the Asian live streaming space to 60%.</p>

<p>Impressed by its growing dominance in Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, Tam Hock Chuan, managing director of Vertex Growth, says his firm believes that M17 is well prepared for the next phase of growth with a "unique value proposition and battle-hardened management team."</p>

<p>With a strong presence in Asia, M17 plans to expand into the US and emerging markets, including the Middle East, to include more artists and viewers into its ecosystem.</p>

<p>As on-demand viewing is gaining traction, M17 turns the opportunity into a commercial success. As Jeff Chang, managing director of Vertex Growth, describes, the startup is “a beneficiary from the accelerating shift towards building a digital economy.”</p>

<p>For the past few months, the startup says it has seen a significant growth in the number of artists and viewers, as the coronavirus pandemic leads to an increased consumption of digital content.</p>

<p>Since then, he has been on a mission to promote it to the people of Taiwan, who suffer from one of the highest rates of retinal detachment in the world.</p>

<p>As he helps people improve their vision at <a href="https://yogacharles.com/?fbclid=IwAR0axeeMlk_gLQkR_fjnnqMAj6F-s_5I4aA5TXiGRzx7CKSoDUDk9TYI7tM" title="https://yogacharles.com/?fbclid=IwAR0axeeMlk_gLQkR_fjnnqMAj6F-s_5I4aA5TXiGRzx7CKSoDUDk9TYI7tM">Yoga Charles</a>, Du also seeks to achieve personal growth in multiple dimensions -- physically, intellectually, spiritually, and etc.</p>

<p>“To me, growth is change, which means ‘to be better today than I was yesterday,’” he explains. “I feel like right now Taiwan is the best place for my growth.”</p>

<h2>Life as digital nomad</h2>

<p>Before leaving his hometown, Du has led a successful career as a product manager: he has developed NASA’s first app, worked on consumer products for Apple, and co-founded carsharing unicorn Getaround, where he helped with the company’s first prototype.</p>

<p>To him, the experience of working for big companies has been valuable. “It made me efficient and good at certain skills,” he says. “There’s also a lot of really smart people that you can learn from.”</p>

<p>However, he understands that he eventually needs to grow his own business if he ever wants to fully focus on personal growth, instead of working for a company, which aims to bring values to the shareholders.</p>

<p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, companies are laying off their workforce to stay afloat, and this is the time when people realize their jobs aren’t as secure as they may expect, he says.</p>

<p>From there, Du left his career behind and started to travel around the world. He has become a digital nomad, who works from everywhere from Prague to Taipei.</p>

<p>“To grow naturally, I have to have the freedom to change my environment,” he says. “If I can find an environment that grows me in the area that I want, then all I have to do is to be inside it.”</p>

<p>With a clear vision, a person knows where to go and grow themselves, he says. However, in absence of such vision, they have to expose themselves to various experiences first.</p>

<p>Du says he has experienced a high rate of growth during a burning man event, a weeklong festival where tens of thousands of people gather in the Nevada desert to create a temporary community.</p>

</figure>

<p>In this period of fast growth, “new ideas come to us and we get transformed in a way,” he tells Business Next.</p>

<p>It was his first time to experience what he calls “growth spurts" and also the moment he realized that he needs to lead a location and time location independent career to experience different environments.</p>

<p><strong>“If you live in one place doing one thing, you’re only doing linear growth,” he says. “But if you’re placed in a different environment, you have the potential to do exponential growth.”</strong></p>

<p>For the past few years, he would move to a new location every month and later every season, and now, he\'s in Taiwan, where he discovered what he\'s willing to devote his life to.</p>

<p>"By coming to Taiwan, I came across eye yoga, and that’s the effect of traveling," he says.</p>

<p>Drawing on his experience, Du encourages them to travel outside Taiwan and live in a different country to truly experience what wouldn’t be possible in Taiwan. “If they want to be global, they should go and experience it,” he says.</p>

<p>In addition, he also suggests that founders take their entire workforce to live in a foreign country in order to broaden their horizon.</p>

<h2>Develop a feeling of truth</h2>

<p>On top of experience, personal growth involves self-reflection. That is, after being placed in and learning from a new environment, a person has to reflect on the experience to “toss out what’s not pertinent to their life,” he says.</p>

<p>Du describes this process as a “cycle of expansion and condensation,” and it’s only after going through a series of these cycles can a person pick up what they feel true and lead their life with a clear vision.</p>

<p>Some people make life decisions based on logic, so they may weigh the pros and cons on paper before doing so. “But in the end, your heart is telling you something,” he says. “A lot people ignore their feeling and listen to their parents and the society, and the truth becomes a little hazy.”</p>

<p>Eventually, this feeling of truth translates into “a faith in the universe,” he says. “You feel you’re going to the right direction and the universe rewards you, and you ask yourself: ‘what are the chances that this has happened to me right now.’”</p>

<p>In the meantime, such feeling is also a source of innovation.</p>

<p>As an award-winning product manager, he says to be the best product person isn’t to be data driven -- but data informed. In other words, they don’t make decisions based on what data tell them; instead, they make decisions and see how data backs them up.</p>

<p>He takes Steve Jobs as an example. The innovative mind behind Apple draws a lot of truths from his feelings, and the data prove to be supporting them, he says.</p>

<p>“There are so many things we experience that we know are true, but it’s hard to find data to justify they’re true,” he says. Du, therefore, suggests that we “lead more with the heart, less with the mind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://pinjamwinwin.com/" title="https://pinjamwinwin.com/">PinjamWinWin</a>, a fintech company based in Surabaya, Indonesia, is known for its P2P lending app that offers fast and easy loans to individuals and small businesses.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, the startup has recently released a mobile app called Konek, whose users sign up to collect overdue payments for the company and earn extra income -- of up to Rp25 million (US$1,700) per month.</p>

<p>On PinjamWinWin, over 90% of the loans are repaid on time, founder and CEO James Susanto says. He regards the app as a great addition to make sure the lending platform is 100% secure and trustworthy for lenders.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>With the app installed and their identity verified, a Konek user -- or agent, as Susanto calls them -- will match with a borrower who fails to repay the loan on time and pay a visit to their place of residence to demand payment.</p>

<p>PinjamWinWin’s lending app collects user data, including home address, and every borrower has to grant the app access to their location data. Since it shares the data with Konek via backend services, an agent will only match with those who are physically close to them.</p>

<p>The borrower will be notified when an agent is on their way to visit them, Susanto explains. That’s why there are cases where borrowers repay their loan before someone knocks on their door, or even when they see the notification.</p>

<p>On average, a visit takes around three to five minutes and ends with the two people taking a selfie to prove the visit has taken place.</p>

<p><strong>In a broader sense, Susanto says sending people to visit the borrowers is a way to “ensure they stay connected with the lending platform.”</strong></p>

<p>PinjamWinWin also tasks Konek users with meeting new borrowers face-to-face to verify their identity or to learn the reasons why they uninstall the lending app.</p>

<p>Susanto says his startup is the first in the world to roll out such service and is actively looking for new gig workers based in major Indonesian cities, including the capital Jakarta, where most of its funds are disbursed.</p>

<p>Last year, PinjamWinWin <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45338" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45338">was accepted into Mobile Only Accelerator (MOX)</a>, a Taiwan-based accelerator that focuses on emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and South Asia. It also <a href="https://e27.co/surabaya-based-pinjamwinwin-secures-funding-from-sosv-mox-aimed-to-help-finance-unbanked-indonesian-20190916/" title="https://e27.co/surabaya-based-pinjamwinwin-secures-funding-from-sosv-mox-aimed-to-help-finance-unbanked-indonesian-20190916/">raised an undisclosed sum from SOSV</a>, the VC firm that operates the program.</p>

<p>With the funding, the company says it will be able to provide insurance-backed loans for more unbanked Indonesians, who account for over half of the entire population, and also dominate the Indonesian P2P lending market valued at $60 billion.</p>

<p>PinjamWinWin’s lending app allows individuals and small businesses to apply for a Rp500 thousand ($34) to Rp5 million ($340) loan at a low interest rate. Powered by artificial intelligence, the KYC process takes less than a day.</p>

<p>As lenders, users enjoy a 12 to 48 percent annual interest rate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the company also offers business loans of up to Rp2 billion ($135 thousand) to larger companies, which are the main source of revenue for the company, Susanto says to <a href="https://e27.co/hailing-from-surabaya-this-p2p-lending-platform-quietly-makes-it-to-the-countrys-top-fintech-scene-20191203/" title="https://e27.co/hailing-from-surabaya-this-p2p-lending-platform-quietly-makes-it-to-the-countrys-top-fintech-scene-20191203/">e27</a>. It has been profitable since 2017.</p>

<p>Following the success in Indonesia, Susanto says the startup seeks to expand into Thailand, India, and the Philippines with the goal of promoting financial inclusion in the developing world.</p>

<p>Customers in these places are also able to collect their orders in three days, at the soonest, while paying a lower delivery fee.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, most retailers are used to shipping their goods to convenience stores for local shoppers to go and pick them up, but it’s usually not that easy when they want to serve shoppers from overseas.</p>

<p>To sell their products beyond Taiwan, online retailers often need to set up their own logistics network and payment gateway, and some of them simply cannot afford to so.</p>

<p>Fiona Lau, co-founder and COO of Shopline, says many Taiwanese retailers in fact have the potential to expand into foreign markets. She points out that on Shopline’s platform, more than 40% of these online sellers have received orders from overseas, despite their focus on the Taiwan market.</p>

<p>Founded in 2013, the Hong Kong-based company builds an e-commerce platform helping retailers launch and manage their online shops. It announces expansion into Taiwan in 2015 and since then has helped more than 120 thousand local retailers start their online business, including Taiwanese tea brand Jing Sheng Yu, skincare brand Greenvines, and accessory brand Lucy’s.</p>

<p>Shopline’s collaboration with 7-Eleven makes it easier for online sellers to ship their products abroad. What they need to do is to print out a special label from the store management system, paste it on the product, and send the product to 7-Eleven’s distribution center.</p>

<p>While the product is on its way to the aforementioned three destinations, the seller is able to track the shipment and enhance logistical efficiency.</p>

<p>Besides 7-Eleven stores, Shopline says it also gives shoppers the option to pick up their orders at a number of coffee shops, drugstores, and banks, with which it has signed partnership.</p>

<p>By bringing convenience to shoppers, Lau says her company helps encourage spending on products from Taiwan.</p>

<p>Working with 7-Eleven is part of Shopline’s wider effort to help the online retailers on its platform sell their products internationally, especially to Southeast Asia, a market that sees a rapid growth in e-commerce.</p>

<p>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research and Google <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/google_export_tw/go_global_whitepaper_tw_2019/" title="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/google_export_tw/go_global_whitepaper_tw_2019/">forecast</a> that the size of the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia will grow from $23 billion in 2018 to $102 billion in 2025.</p>

<p>Shopline says it aims to build a robust ecosystem for cross-border e-commerce for retailers by expanding its partner network in logistics, payment, warehousing, and so on.</p>

<p>The company now has offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, and Malaysia.</p>

<p>Globally, more than 90% of the freight is <a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/freight-forwarding/ocean-freight/" title="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/freight-forwarding/ocean-freight/">shipped via ocean</a>. Massive in size, the industry has a great potential for profitability; however, due to the low level of digitization, marine carriers have been mired in the swamp of low return on invested capital.</p>

<p>“If you think about how a shipper books a container to move from point A to B, it’s done largely the same way as it has been done over the last 20 years,” Sean O’Malley, co-founder and CEO of BlueX, tells Business Next.</p>

<p>The communication between the shipper and carrier usually involves a great deal of paperwork, phone calls, and emails, and takes up to two days. However, “that’s just to get your ticket to get a container onto the boat,” he says. After the booking, shippers still need to work with providers of other logistics services, from financing to warehousing, to send the goods to the right destination.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Malley, therefore, co-founded <a href="https://www.bluextrade.com/" title="https://www.bluextrade.com/">BlueX</a> two years ago to connect the carrier and their shippers with an “open freight marketplace” and serve the latter by leading them to complete everything they need in order to ship their freight internationally, free of hassle.</p>

<p>In the time of COVID-19, companies are realizing the necessity of digitizing their business and going paper-free, and BlueX has been seeing interests from carriers as well. “This is how the future needs to work,” Mr. O’Malley says.</p>

<h2>Agoda of FreightTech</h2>

<p>The startup found inspiration in the airline industry that has been actively digitizing for the past 20 years. People used to need to call a travel agent to book a flight, but now, there are websites like Agoda and Expedia, through which they can buy a ticket, book a hotel, and take out an insurance for their trip.</p>

<p>Today, in the container shipping industry, carriers like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have been investing heavily in digitization and <a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2020/02/19/ap-moller-maersk-to-acquire-performance-team" title="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2020/02/19/ap-moller-maersk-to-acquire-performance-team">acquiring</a> a number of trade services providers to diversify their revenue stream. The strategy allows them to enjoy a higher market cap than many other un-digitized carriers.</p>

<p>By doing so, Mr. O’Malley explains that these asset-heavy digitized players aim to gain market share by offering not only shipping but downstream services, from financing and insurance to tracking and warehousing, which are the real source of profits.</p>

<p>According to BlueX’s calculation, an whopping $2,100 can be extracted from a full ocean container in addition to the value of the freight. In other words, the services around shipping can potentially generate around $160 billion in fees annually.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the company is taking another approach to helping carriers grow market cap -- by building an asset-light digital ecosystem.</p>

<p>BlueX provides its carriers a white-label software platform and a marketplace of third-party logistics services to be plugged into the platform. They can benefit from the efficiency that e-bookings bring and being an aggregator of various trade services.</p>

<p>“We help our carriers become a stronger company from not only a cost cutting but a revenue generating perspective,” Mr. O’Malley says.</p>

<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79="14186" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79="1" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79="14186" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79="100">In the carrier backyard</h2>

<p>The list of carriers, notably, includes Evergreen Marine, the largest shipping company headquartered in Taiwan. BlueX has just launched a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evergreen-and-bluexs-integrated-logistics-platform----greenx----receives-over-1000-sign-ups-at-launch-300988775.html" title="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evergreen-and-bluexs-integrated-logistics-platform----greenx----receives-over-1000-sign-ups-at-launch-300988775.html">digital booking platform called GreenX</a> for Evergreen in January, allowing the carrier’s more than 3,000 customers to enjoy digital bookings and access to integrated services.</p>

<p>“It’s a simple model but a powerful one," Mr. O’Malley says. “Our strategy is to go after the biggest carriers and help them monetize their containers better than anyone else in the world.”</p>

<p>Therefore, basing his business in Taiwan is strategic, as the island nation boasts three of the largest container shipping companies in the world, including Evergreen Marine, Yang Ming Marine Transport, and Wan Hai Lines.</p>

<p>“We could be really have advantage over other companies in the world,” Mr. O’Malley says. “It’s difficult for a company in the Silicon Valley to do what we are doing because there are no carriers in the Silicon Valley and even in the US anymore. You need to be in the carrier backyard to build products with them.”</p>

<p><a href="https://eventxtra.com/" title="https://eventxtra.com/">EventXtra</a>, an event tech startup based in Hong Kong, launched a new solution for virtual exhibition half a year ago and reported last week that it has seen a threefold growth in revenue.</p>

<p>The startup says the exponential growth implies that organizing exhibition online is becoming a major trend. “For the past few months, we receive inquiries from 30 to 40 companies every day,” co-founder Sum Wong discloses in a press conference held on EventXtra’s new platform for virtual events.</p>

<p>Despite a huge drop in demand for physical events, the new solution has covered the loss of profits and turned the tide. Mr. Wong explains that virtual events currently account for around 80% of the overall revenue.</p>

<h2>Creating virtual environment with networking elements</h2>

<p>Founded in 2014, EventXtra offers a full stack of software for each stage of event planning, from attendee registration, engagement, to post-event analysis.</p>

<p>The company has organized more than 5,000 offline events for 200 clients, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Alibaba, according to its website.</p>

<p>In response to the impact of Covid-19, EventXtra now also helps organizations create a virtual exhibition environment where attendees can visit booths, join conferences, and schedule online or offline meetings with potential business partners as they do in physical events.</p>

<p>Mr. Wong says some are concerned that virtual events may be less interactive, but his company manages to keep the networking elements in the exhibition. In the online environment EventXtra creates, attendees can still strike up a private conversation and even exchange digital business cards.</p>

<p>While the company expands the new revenue stream, an investor knocks on its door.</p>

<p>In the virtual press conference, EventXtra announces that it has received a new funding from UB Ventures of <a href="https://www.uzabase.com/" title="https://www.uzabase.com/">Uzabase</a>, a Japanese information technology company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange; in addition, it acquired New York-based business media company Quartz in 2018.</p>

<p>EventXtra is the first company that UB Ventures has ever invested outside Japan, which marks the <a href="https://www.uzabase.com/ex/company/news/ub-venntures-invests-in-eventxtra/" title="https://www.uzabase.com/ex/company/news/ub-venntures-invests-in-eventxtra/">beginning</a> for the investment arm to back SaaS companies overseas.</p>

<p>With the new capital and help from Uzabase, EventXtra says it will expand into Japan and grow local presence.</p>

<p>The spending on event software has grown fast in Asia, co-founder Mr. Wong says. “Our goal is to ride on this wave and become the top player in the region to serve as many organizers as possible.”</p>

<p>While serving customers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, EventXtra plans to expand in Japan, South Korea, China, and countries in Southeast Asia like Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

Innovation is part of its competitive advantage while entrepreneurship and industry cooperation is realized through its developmental objectives. The presentation focuses on the Executive Operation Office for Industry-Academia Cooperation (EOOIAC) of CYCU. It provides the approaches and practices of transforming a campus idea into successful startups. Best approaches suggest that the value-added is the systematic support system to shepherd potential entrepreneurs to have confidence in transitioning ideas into facilitating the need of humanity.</p><p>CYCU is a leading integrated private university in Taiwan that traces its roots from its early beginnings in 1953 and 1980 when it became a university. &nbsp;Currently, it offers 38 graduate programs and 13 Ph.D. programs in 29 departments. It produces more than 120,000 alumni and most of them devote their best to the progress of society. &nbsp;Integrating, Creativity, and Innovation are the competitive advantages of CYCU through its development objectives of Holistic Education, Human Concern, and Service Learning.</p><p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has ranked CYCU since 1995 as being the integrated and most prestigious institution of higher education among private universities.

While she is driving the EOOIAC, Mr. Ming-Yen 李明彥 Lee, Ph.D. &nbsp;is providing tactics and strategy as Director of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center (IEDC).</p><p>I met Ms. Chang while she promoted the in-campus startups during an international forum in CYCU sometime in October 2019. After that event, I had an opportunity of linking STARTBOARD with her and possible future collaboration and not competition.</p><p>Although both CYCU and STARTBOARD are offering almost identical services, I highlighted to her that STARTBOARD is the first that incubates students&rsquo; start-ups from ASEAN Countries and India. It is not under any school, university, or government. As an incubator, it has resources that can strengthen incubatees&rsquo; performance. It has its law, patent, and marketing business group. &nbsp;As a flexible and versatile incubator, it considers branching out to countries it supported. Currently. it has an office in Thailand.</p><p>In November 2019, she provided me a call for startups. &nbsp;I was interested in and submitted my idea. &nbsp;Luckily, my idea was one of the projects that have the potential for innovation and development. Accepted start-up entries included 3 projects of international students from the Philippines, Indonesia, India, and Haiti aside from the majority of its participants from local Taiwanese students and alumni. Start-up proposals were ranging from architecture, IT, farming technologies, and digital apps. &nbsp;Initial screening to clear plagiarism and novelty of ideas was done before the projects were enrolled in the tutoring module. &nbsp;I had the opportunity to attend expert advisory of marketing, general business management, and technology transfer that provided me insights and plans if I will decide to pursue my project. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>EOOIAC facilitated rough ideas for its potential innovation and development, product development, and ultimately to become startups. These are enabled through Intelligence Resource and Creativity Integration which composed of value-added module and capability module. &nbsp;Another resource in the international cooperation which implements the tutoring module such as expert advisory, business opportunity, leading technology transfer, venture capitalists match, industrial innovation settlement, international integration counseling, and accelerated development of enterprises. Theoretically, these are just module, what works best is the collaborations and support from 29 departments who have professors that become experts and consultants to these budding potential entrepreneurs. Likewise, the different centers such as Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Cooperation &amp; Technology Licensing, Industrial Accelerator &amp; Incubation, and Industrial Liaison are specialized to facilitate the developmental needs of the project transformation to become startups.</p><p>The schematic diagram below summarizes the whole process;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/db0/c24/929/db0c249297f4458acac3ebae9a8ee2d67d9987a7.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p><!--[if !vml]-->From laboratory to startup is promoted through its campus entrepreneurship mechanism for professors. &nbsp;Each professor will do the original technology screening and background surveys of projects.

<p>“Innovative solutions for contact tracing, smart resource allocation, and remote learning and working are crucial in the combat against COVID-19, and talent is the key to developing these solutions,” she explained at the launch for the <a href="https://www.ait.org.tw/talent-circulation-alliance-white-paper/" title="https://www.ait.org.tw/talent-circulation-alliance-white-paper/">Talent Circulation Alliance (TCA) white paper</a>.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019, the <a href="https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/" title="https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/">TCA</a> is a public-private partnership between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taiwan authorities, which facilitates the circulation of talent between Taiwan, the United States, and other like-minded countries. To be published annually, the white paper provides recommendations on how Taiwan can improve its policies to become an “international talent hub.”</p>

<p>Tsai first underscored two main aspects in talent cultivation: improving English proficiency and digital skills. To turn Taiwan into a “bilingual nation” by 2030, the government has been helping universities set up English education centers and encouraging public service workers to speak English at work.</p>

<p>“Improvements made in these areas will allow Taiwanese talent to stand out in the globalized era,” Tsai said.</p>

<p>As tech giants like Microsoft come to Taiwan to set up R&amp;D centers, the President said the government is engaging international companies in the cultivation of local talent.</p>

<p>Taiwan also seeks to continue helping young Taiwanese to study or work abroad and return to their home country with new skill sets.</p>

<p>“Many of Taiwan’s most successful leaders in industry, government, academia and civil society first gained experience abroad, primarily the United States, and then returned to Taiwan to make a positive difference,” said AIT Director William Christensen. Examples include TSMC Founder Morris Chang, who spoke at last year’s <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45674" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45674">Talent Circulation Summit</a>.</p>

<p>The TCA aims to help replicate Taiwan’s economic success story in the digital age by bringing in expertise from the US and other democratic countries.</p>

<p>“Taiwan has few natural resources, but it has an abundance of talented people,” the TCA white paper writes. “If the people of Taiwan are equipped with the necessary skills and then connected to the world, Taiwan will naturally succeed and be able to chart its own future for decades to come.”</p>

<p>The inaugural white paper offers five key suggestions for the nation to transform into a hub for global talent: develop a national strategy for talent circulation, facilitate international academic exchange, leverage foreign talent already in Taiwan, encourage the free circulation of startup talent, and increase the participation of women in Taiwan’s professional life.</p>

<p>Besides internationalizing Taiwan’s talent for the digital era, President Tsai also recognizes the importance of attracting talent from other parts of the world to stimulate creativity and innovation.</p>

<p>“Since 2018, we have also issued more than 720 <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/search/tag/Employment%20gold%20card" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/search/tag/Employment%20gold%20card">Employment Gold Cards</a> to top talent around the world, and in the future, we will loosen restrictions and incentivize local companies to hire foreign nationals,” she said.</p>

<p>With the National Development Council’s efforts, Tsai expects Taiwan to build stronger relationship with the US in talent circulation.</p>

<p>In the long run, the circulation of talent with like-minded countries may help grow Taiwan\'s talent and prevent a brain drain. “If Taiwan’s top talent is deeply connected with the free and open Indo-Pacific, then its future will likewise remain centered in the democratic world,” said Director Christensen.</p>

<p>The AIT believes having sufficient talent is a prerequisite for accomplishing all of Taiwan’s policy goals, and learning how to cultivate and manage them will help solve virtually all the other challenges Taiwan faces.</p>

<p>Seeing how inefficient these two main types of COVID tests -- the PCR and the antibody tests -- can be, a Taiwanese biotech startup decides to dive into developing a rapid antigen test, which is still rare in the market in comparison with antibody test.</p>

<p>Min-Wen Chung, co-founder of <a href="http://www.lumistar.com.tw/" title="http://www.lumistar.com.tw/">LumiSTAR</a>, says their rapid test detects an infection in patients within 15 minutes -- far more quickly than a regular PCR test does. “Since the launch of this new project, our goal has been to tell the patient as soon as possible if they have the virus.”</p>

<p>Antibody tests are performed to see if a blood specimen contains antibodies, a sign that the human body tries to fight off pathogens like the novel coronavirus; however, it takes a week or two for the body to develop antibodies, co-founder Yu-Fen Chang says. “During this period of time, some patients might be infecting many others.”</p>

<p>For asymptomatic carriers, antibody tests can be quite helpful, she goes on. But for frontline workers like airport staff, who need to deal directly with a large number of people, antigen tests like theirs stand out as a better option.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1592533211776.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1585085718-51811-121220200616165551@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1585085718-51811-121220200616165551@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-03/img-1585085718-51811-121220200616165551@900.jpg 900w" title="LumiSTAR co-founder Yu-Fen Chang" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 800px;">

<p>Based on the rapid testing technology, LumiSTAR is building an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device for these workers to screen visitors who can come from anywhere in the world by taking a swab of their throat. It’s an electrochemical gadget like blood glucose meter.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of manufacturers of this kind of meters in Taiwan, so it shouldn’t be a problem for us to find one and work together,” Chung says.</p>

<p>Performed outside the lab setting, LumiSTAR’s point-of-care testing (POCT) technique allows test results to be shared instantly with test performers and later on, healthcare providers for them to take necessary action like hospitalization.</p>

<h2>Detecting the virus with a glow</h2>

<p>Nowadays, most antigen tests for the novel coronavirus are paper-based strips coated with antibodies. Like rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), they have often been criticized for giving false negatives. The same issue was raised around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-white-house-test-staff-kits-accused-false-negatives-2020-5" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-white-house-test-staff-kits-accused-false-negatives-2020-5">Abbott’s rapid testing system</a>.</p>

<p>Chang says her team abandoned the idea of developing paper tests, which take a matter of minutes for results but has serious limitation in terms of sensitivity and specificity. But still, there are other difficulties lying ahead.</p>

<p>Creating an antigen test often involves a large-scale antibody production in lab animals like mice, rats, and rabbits, but it not only causes unnecessary suffering but ends up prolonging the development of an urgently-needed solution by four to six months.</p>

<p>To avoid sacrificing animals, LumiSTAR turns to E. coli, a type of bacteria commonly found in human intestines, and Chang says now they are able to generate a sufficient amount of antibodies for experiments in just three days.</p>

<p>“With the time spent on antibody production shortened, the cost also drops significantly,” Chung adds.</p>

<p>What’s more, during the manufacturing process, a fluorescent protein-based indicator is attached to all the antibodies, so when they bind to the coronavirus, a chemical reaction occurs and induces a glow with a light color.</p>

<p>By converting the light into electricity, the same reaction that indicates a viral infection can be detected by the IVD device. Chung notes that among many advantages, the device is easy to use and allows high throughput screening.</p>

<p>In their Taipei office, Chang says there are also several “readers” that can examine 96 throat swab specimens at a time, and if operated an entire day, can go through three to four thousand.</p>

<h2 data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-2401869_79="1284216" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-2401869_79="1" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen-2401869_79="1284216" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-2401869_79="100">Looking for new COVID-19 treatments</h2>

<p>Before the pandemic, LumiSTAR has been developing an all-optical platform for drug screening, and now, the startup plans to launch a similar platform for COVID-19 treatments.</p>

<p>“A drug works by blocking the virus at multiple points in its life cycle, from the entry into the cell, replication, to reorganization, and our platform examines if the blocking is effective.” Chang says. “If it inhibits viral replication, for example, the fluorescence is weakened.”</p>

<p>The most effective treatment may be like HAART for AIDS, which typically comprises of a combination of multiple antiretroviral drugs, Chung adds.</p>

<p>Rather than repurposing known drugs, LumiSTAR is inclining towards identifying new treatments for COVID-19 -- in a wide array of herbal extracts provided by Taiwan’s Medical and Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center (PITDC).</p>

<p>Once it discovers an unknown but effective drug, the startup plans to license it to pharmaceutical companies or collaborate with contract research organizations, who conduct clinical trials for pharmas.</p>

<p>“There’s still a long way to go,” Chang says. As VC money flows into Taiwan due to its effective response to COVID-19, LumiSTAR has been actively talking with investors, hoping to scale up its business and make contributions to the society.</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, the startup has gone through several pivots to become a multinational business as it is today. Starting from a live-streaming karaoke platform, iKala now operates two main divisions -- for cloud and retail solutions -- and offers services across Asia, from Japan, Taiwan, to countries in Southeast Asia like Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. Their clients include Ogilvy, L’Oreal, Foodpanda, and others.</p>

<p>“As the pandemic hits the global market, iKala has seen a 45% QoQ growth in revenue due to the strong demand for digital transformation,” said co-founder and CEO Sega Cheng. iKala’s cloud division was launched earlier this year.</p>

<p>As ad blockers and AI drive a paradigm shift in digital marketing, iKala decided to jump into smart retail to help clients sell their products more effectively and efficiently in Southeast Asia, where social commerce is taking over the online shopping arena.</p>

<p>Cheng said the cloud division now makes up 60% to 70% of iKala’s revenue, “but as we expand in Southeast Asia, we are confident that the smart retail division will be on par with it within a year.”</p>

<h2>A head start in social commerce</h2>

<p>With 350 million Internet users in Southeast Asia and 90% connecting to the Internet via their smartphone, the opportunity for e-commerce businesses is massive. According to Google’s <a href="https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf" title="https://www.blog.google/documents/47/SEA_Internet_Economy_Report_2019.pdf">SEA e-conomy 2019 report</a>, the size of the market is forecast to exceed $100 billion per annum by 2025.</p>

<p>It’s noteworthy that the region has seen a leapfrogging in e-commerce. “Before traditional e-commerce sites become widely used, local customers are already turning to sellers on social media,” Cheng said. By contrast, in other Asian countries like Japan and Taiwan, customers tend to shop on e-commerce sites rather than buying from individual sellers.</p>

<p>In response to this phenomenon, iKala has developed <a href="https://www.shoplus.me/en/" title="https://www.shoplus.me/en/">Shoplus</a>, a social commerce solution that “turns a Facebook fan page into a online retail shop in ten seconds.” With visual recognition, natural language processing technologies, and AI chat bot, Shoplus helps social media sellers communicate with their customers efficiently and send out retargeting messages. The solution increases conversion rate by 20% and reduces labor costs by 80%.</p>

<p>During a citywide lockdown, the solution has also helped Unilever Philippines move physical shops online and significantly boost its ROAS.</p>

<p>With two main strategies -- integrating existing physical sales channels and exploring new channels on social media, iKala hopes to empower companies with AI solutions and help them drive sales performance, according to a press release.</p>

<p>By using AI to put together the vast amount of data gathered both offline and online, iKala said it’s able to provide a clear picture of how each customer behaves and allow enterprises to achieve precision marketing.</p>

<p>The company also boasts a proprietary technology that collects and analyzes data on social media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram to help companies identify the best influencers they should work with to maximize the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>iKala said it aims to become a dominant player in nine Asian countries, from Taiwan and Japan to Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>

<p>“Even if Taiwan as a market cannot sustain the growth of a hugely successful startup company, it might be possible for multiple markets of the same size,” said Lee Feng Chien, the former Google Taiwan managing director. He has joined iKala in February as an independent board member.</p>

<p>The size of Taiwan’s population, at just 23 million, makes it challenging for a startup to scale up domestically. However, located at the center of East Asia, with Japan and Korea in the north and SEA in the south, the island nation offers a great opportunity for businesses to expand regionally. Collectively, the population of these countries stands at around 800 million.</p>

<p>Most East Asian countries have been managing the coronavirus crisis much more effectively than others, Chien said. Confident in the future of the region, he believes Taiwanese startups should work to get ahead of the game.</p>

In this article, we are going to see the best performing social media channels in Taiwan.

You can both post photos or short videos of your business and target them to your customers. It is intuitive rather than an informative platform. So the more unique your content is, the more followers you receive. According to the survey in the year 2016, 51% of internet users and 71% of youths aging 16-24 are using Instagram in Taiwan. Teenagers and youngsters aging 13 to 24 are engaging with the brand if they feel the contact is unique.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="text-align: justify;">2.

About 19 million people are using this platform, which is about 79 percent of the entire population. People here use this platform for checking the shops, finding the events, and also buy or sell on Facebook, etc. There is an N number of ways to promote our business on Facebook, but usually, we do it by creating a fan page to develop our business. 18-44 years of age are the mainstream group using this platform, but there are also millions of users above 45 years of age using Facebook.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="text-align: justify;">3.

On PTT, there are bullet boards of different topics, including CVS, gossips, politics, sports, literature, etc. It is so powerful that it can integrate youths for the social movement and regroup non-governmental powers. It is also used for entertainment purposes and to gossip about other information. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the peak time, there will be at most 150000+ people online, and most of them are at the age of 18-35. However, you directly can&#39;t promote your products or service in PTT, as it might increase negativity. Customers or the general public will be the ambassadors who promote the brand using word of mouth marketing.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="text-align: justify;">4.

It is more like a platform to share daily life rather than to promote products or services. The content discussed here is mostly related to life, especially schoolwork, current news, and affection. Dcard is similar to PTT, but it emphasizes more on linking with others. Most of the users are college students due to restrictions. 50.8% of users belong to ages 15 to 24, and there are about 42.5 thousand daily visitors visits Dcard.

You can build connections through this platform by word of mouth marketing.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p style="text-align: justify;">6.

It has one of the biggest audiences in Taiwan, and the people of 16-24 years of age, on average, spend 2.5 hours a day. It has also become the platform for all the age groups, as per research 40% people consisting of age 55-64 watched YouTube every day for 1.5 hours. Mostly the users reach out to this platform for viewing recreational content and also informative content as per their needs. So, YouTube is the best channel to promote services and products by casting ads or sponsoring You Tubers.

<p>In 2007, when Jameson Hsu turned down Google’s offer to buy his startup for $10 million, he was expecting the tech giant to raise the price to $55 million, but it didn’t.</p>

<p>Instead, “they told us ‘we’re going to build what you’re building,’” Hsu recalls. “It was quite naive of us...it was just two of us (co-founder Bob Ippolito and himself) and the company clearly isn’t worth that much.”</p>

<p>Three years later, Hsu and Ippolito agreed to sell Mochi Media, a Flash-based games platform, to Shanda Games, one of the largest operators of online games in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/11/mochi-media-acquired-by-shanda-games/" title="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/11/mochi-media-acquired-by-shanda-games/">for $80 million</a>.</p>

<p>With Google’s offer, Mochi Media has raised $14 million over two venture rounds in the Bay Area prior to the acquisition in 2010. Hsu believes the tech giant’s early interest in his startup shows a “good sign” that they’re going in the right direction.</p>

<p>As for the risk of turning Google into a potential competitor, he says he wasn’t concerned. “Big companies do a lot of things, but they don’t do a lot of them well,” he explains.</p>

<p>All the same, investors can hesitate to bet on startups that compete with big tech firms, especially the Big Five.</p>

<p>For that reason, Phil Chen, a general partner of Race Capital, says it didn’t seem smart to him to invest in Zoom back in 2016 -- but the video conferencing company has just reported a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/daily-crunch-zoom-reports-spectacular-growth/" title="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/daily-crunch-zoom-reports-spectacular-growth/">$169% YoY growth</a> due to the shift to remote work.</p>

<p>“When I was in Horizons [Ventures], we were once investing in three companies at a time,” Chen says; they are Impossible Foods, Modern Meadow, and Zoom.</p>

<p>While the first two are ahead of their time, what Zoom offers is a similar service that Google and Microsoft have also been developing. The company tried to convince his team that it has the potential to grow much faster, but Chen says he remained dubious.</p>

<p>However, looking back, he says he knows how they made it, despite working on a “boring” product: “Even though Google and Microsoft have similar services, they are also focusing on other sexy things like AI.”</p>

<p>Indeed, having limited resources often put startups in a less favorable position than big companies, but it allows them to focus on the success of a single product.</p>

<p>“As a startup, you don’t have a lot of money and resources to work on many different products,” says John Chen, the founder and managing partner of Hive ventures. “You have to focus on your core strength.”</p>

<p>Having said that, he admits it\'s certainly not easy. In a startup he worked for, he has once run four different product lines due to customer requests. “Customers always have a lot of suggestions like whether you should build this feature or not,” Chen says; “but customization kills scalability.”</p>

<p>To be clear, unlike customization, he believes standardization is necessary in product development, and to standardize a good enough product -- to replicate and sell it in global markets -- it’s still crucial to talk to users and learn from their feedback.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of “a startup that focuses” is Armorize Technologies, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/240159768/proofpoint-seals-25-million-deal-for-armorize-technologies.htm" title="https://www.crn.com/news/security/240159768/proofpoint-seals-25-million-deal-for-armorize-technologies.htm">the cybersecurity company from which Jordon Forssman exited in 2013</a>.

<p>Forssman says Armorize has gained market leadership in the anti-spam technology space that Microsoft and Google have been working on for years but gradually losing interest in. Like how Phil Chen describes Zoom’s service, he calls this area “boring” to many businesses.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, at the time "when people are getting malware in pdf documents and malicious URLs, nobody has the answer to that except Armorize,” Forssman claims. “Microsoft tried to get in too late with bad technology and it couldn’t do it right.”</p>

<p>In fact, it takes eight years for Armorize to focus on its core technology before the $25 million acquisition. “Sometimes, things that are not sexy are worth a lot of money because everyone has moved on,” Forssman says.</p>

<p>To out-compete tech Goliaths, for one thing, startups need to identify what they are best at. “Being number one in that thing is better than being number two in multiple things,” John Chen explains. For another, what’s more difficult but equally important is to persevere.</p>

<p>Founded in 2016, Swingvy runs a cloud-based platform that offers HR, payroll, and benefits solutions to small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) on a freemium basis.</p>

<p>Jin Choeh, co-founder and CEO of Swingvy, Taiwan as a market presents great opportunities for growth, with its 1.5 million SMEs in need of an effective solution to replace paperwork and legacy software.</p>

<p>“In Taiwan, there isn’t a market leader in HR tech for SME yet,” the CEO says. “Our goal is to be one of the top 3 HR tech startups in a year, and we want to gain a dominant market share in three to five years.”</p>

<p>With its product, Swingvy is working to help Taiwanese SMEs deal with basic HR tasks, expense management, as well as automatic payroll calculation and processing, for saving the time and cost spent on HR; by using the software, a company needs to spend just three hours per month on traditional HR matters, reducing associated costs by 80%.</p>

<p>Swingvy’s solution, in addition to cutting significant costs by bringing HR functions in-house, saves a lot of time for a company by handling all of them in a single platform. All employees can submit a claim, apply for a leave, or time-off in the Swingvy platform instead of turning to a human HR, who then often needs to go through a series of paperwork to process them.</p>

<p>Since the task of entering data into the system falls to the employees, HR managers will have the time to do other things that matter to the growth of the company, like building a organizational culture that values creativity and innovation, Cheoh explains.</p>

<p>For companies who haven’t built an HR team, they may invest the capital in other functions like R&amp;D and sales/marketing, which Cheoh considers the two main columns that support a tech startup like his own.</p>

<p>As in Singapore and Malaysia, Swingvy says it plans to provide insurance options for companies in Taiwan in the near future. It means HR managers will be able to get the employees insured in several clicks.</p>

<p>“From day one, we have a vision that we want to be the operation system of companies,” Choeh says. “In the following two years, we are launching Swingvy insurance and will need time to expand this product line to Taiwan.”</p>

<p>Now serving over 8,000 clients across Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, Swingvy looks to expand into Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia, which makes up a market of 70 million SMBs.</p>

<p>Choeh believes to fully enjoy the benefits from his product, customers need to be in a market where the GDP is above $8,000 per capita. “Rather than relying on low-cost workforce, they will realize that using a software will bring a higher return on investment,” he explains.</p>

<p>Globally, COVID-19 has expedited digital transformation for companies, and it has been a boon for Swingvy.</p>

<p>Although the company says it has lost some of the SME clients who shut down their business amid economic fallout from the pandemic, a great number of mid-sized companies have taken to implement its solution.</p>

<p>“While SMBs care more about saving time and cost, these mid-sized companies shifts to us from traditional HR software as part of their crisis management plan,” Cheoh explains.</p>

<p>Legacy HR software, often installed on office PCs, might not be relevant after COVID-19, since many companies are considering allowing their employees to work from home.</p>

<p>As a SaaS provider, this policy change creates a huge growth opportunity for them, Cheoh says, and in response to that, Swingvy is adding a new time attendance system to its platform and plans to make it available to clients in all markets. Their employees will soon be able to punch in/out every day via an app.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, Cheoh suggests that businesses create a protocol for remote work and be sensitive to the needs of their employees.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('Taiwan, catching up in software economy: Interview with Jordan Forssman', '2020-07-14', '', '<p>Fifteen years ago, software and Internet startups were few and far between in Taiwan. The country was still reveling in the success of indigenous semiconductor and PC industries, and with the vast majority of investors balking at investing in software due to the dotcom bust of 2000-2001, most companies preferred building their business around hardware to software solutions.</p>

<p>It was around the same time when Jordan Forssman and his teammates started to fundraise for their cybersecurity startup Armorize Technologies. He recalled meeting local investors, mostly from investment banks, who were old fashioned in how they communicate, operate, and structure their firm.</p>

<p>Back in the day, most people in the investment sector are old at age, wear a suit with tie, and favor hardware companies. But as the local venture capital industry emerges, they’re being replaced by young analysts, in a T-shirt and jeans, passionately talking about new technologies they focus on like AI, blockchain, and genomics.</p>

<p>It’s “a whole different vibe” in the investment community, Forssman described. He had been working as the head of business development for Armorize Technologies before it was <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquire-armorize-technologies-inc" title="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquire-armorize-technologies-inc">acquired by Proofprint in 2013</a>. “There was nothing like this when we started in Armorize, not even close.”</p>

<p>During his 17 years of living in Taiwan for study and work, Forssman witnessed first-hand not only how the the local investment environment has become more vibrant but also how drastically the country has changed in an effort to catch up in a software-based economy.</p>

<h2>How far Taiwan has gone</h2>

<p>Historically, hardware companies in Taiwan achieved their success by competing on price. With the cheapest products in hand, they didn’t need to reach out to customers with sophisticated marketing strategies; instead, they often waited for them to knock on their door.</p>

<p>“It was safe to do business, but you can only make it safe for so long,” Forssman said. “Now, the rest of the world catches up and competes with you, sometimes even in your home market.”</p>

<p>It’s true that these companies have built Taiwan’s economy, but in the era of Internet and globalization, they risk being outcompeted by those who provide even cheaper products from countries like China and India.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this type of business is also becoming less and less attractive to the new venture builders. As this shift away from hardware plays out, investors are also feeling more comfortable backing companies who work on software solutions they used to dismiss as risky.</p>

<p>“In this era, you need to have a mindset shift to this risk loving approach,” Forssman said. “This change is inevitable, and if it’s forced upon you, you have no control.”</p>

<p>With startup companies diving into new technologies and the support of venture capitalists, Taiwan may be “well on its way and more advanced than many other countries” <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/341247" title="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/341247">as a technological powerhouse</a>, Forssman said. But Taiwanese companies still need to learn to engage and interact with their customers around the world.</p>

<p>He considers this to be one of the major challenges for the country to integrate into the global, knowledge-based economy. After all, “software and services are for people,” Forssman said, “not just about manufacturing a product and shipping it to other places in the world.”</p>

<p>English-speaking countries like India, Ireland, and South Africa might gain an upper hand in this respect, but he expects the situation to turn around as <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3952051" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3952051">Taiwan transforms itself into a bilingual nation in the upcoming decade</a>. Along with other government initiatives like the Employment Gold Card, Forssman believes the change will attract foreign entrepreneurs and incentivize global companies to set up their regional headquarter or an R&amp;D center in Taiwan.</p>

<p>While Taiwan strives to earn a place in the new economy, the Internet has spawned hundreds of thousands of software startups in the Silicon Valley. Despite Taiwan’s efforts in becoming the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2017/02/07/how-taiwan-is-reinventing-its-national-culture-from-manufacturing-efficiency-to-innovation-ip/#22190b316650" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2017/02/07/how-taiwan-is-reinventing-its-national-culture-from-manufacturing-efficiency-to-innovation-ip/#22190b316650">Silicon Valley of Asia</a>, It can take a few decades for the island nation to catch up.</p>

<p>For one, a typical Silicon Valley startup founder is “in their twenties but already in their second company or sixteen investments,” Forssman said. They hit rich at a young age, exit from their startup company, and start investing in other ventures.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, Forssman said the first generation of successful software entrepreneurs like Wayne Huang, founder of Armorize Technologies, saw their opportunity to do the same only in their late thirties or early forties -- after spending a lot more years of building a company than their Silicon Valley counterparts.</p>

<p>The twenty- or thirty-year gap is indicative of how Silicon Valley is ahead of Taiwan, where the culture of running the risk to invest in future unicorns is just taking shape.</p>

<p>But Forssman holds out hope that the <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46316">next wave of entrepreneurs</a> will help vitalize the ecosystem with their knowledge, network, and financial resources when they exit successfully at a younger age.</p>

<p>Today, with a great number of accelerators created, young founders in Taiwan are also receiving support and learning how to build their first startup. “I think we are in the midst of building the environment for entrepreneurs,” Forssman said, to engage in the startup industry early in their life and keep it running.</p>

<h2>Recognizing what Taiwan has</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, Taiwan has been working to strengthen its innovation ecosystem by launching startup accelerators and incubators like <a href="https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=135672" title="https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&amp;post=135672">Taiwan Tech Arena</a> and funding startup companies. But doing so with Silicon Valley as the only reference drives the country into a tunnel vision.</p>

<p>“It’s a great target to be like, but don’t forget that other countries, who also want to be like the Valley, don’t have what you have,” Forssman suggested. “Be aware of the fact that you’re lucky.”</p>

<p>Here, he’s talking about the group of Taiwanese-American entrepreneurs, who have successfully exited from their startups via acquisition in the 2000s like Steve Chen (co-founder of Youtube), Jameson Hsu (founder of Mochi Media), and Kai Huang (founder of RedOctane). Remembered as the <a href="https://www.mafia.tw/" title="https://www.mafia.tw/">Taiwan Mafia</a> -- reminiscent of the Paypal Mafia, most of them have been staying in Taiwan now to help local startup founders build and grow their business globally.</p>

<p>“Most countries don’t have the success stories coming back home, re-planting the seeds, and sharing their knowledge,” Forssman said, noting that it makes a huge difference in the ability to develop a new industry and catch up with the rest of the world. “People in Taiwan don’t understand how special this is.”</p>

<p>Most recently, Taiwan’s success in handling the coronavirus pandemic has put the nation in the spotlight, and Forssman said it should take advantage of the situation to reach out to other countries. He called the <a href="https://taiwancanhelp.us/" title="https://taiwancanhelp.us/">"Taiwan Can Help" campaign</a> of mask donations a brilliant act.</p>

<p>Ten years ago when working for Armorize, Forssman recounted, they needed to explain to their customers that they’re a Taiwanese company. But now, “everybody knows about Taiwan because of COVID-19,” and, quite unexpectedly, Hong Kong’s civil unrest.</p>

<p>With increased visibility and many advantages for businesses -- a clear legal framework, protection of intellectual property rights, and close connections with neighboring countries like Japan, to name a few, he believes Taiwan will come out of the crisis much stronger.</p>

<p>Together, the partnership leverages awoo\'s existing customer experience optimisation (CXO) platform nununi and Repro’s CEP — which will be introduced to Taiwan’s e-commerce market in the second half of the year — to offer a holistic solution for their clients.</p>

<p>The collaboration aims to tackle three common pain points for marketing: High customer acquisition cost, insufficient digital interaction with brands, and poor customer shopping experience, and it strives to drive digital marketing return on investment.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from awoo told <em>Meet</em> that awoo and Repro specialize in purchasing marketing and engagement marketing, respectively. Through the partnership, companies can orchestrate their marketing stack and ultimately build a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.</p>

<p>In addition to this, awoo will help Repro to enter Taiwan, and Repro will facilitate awoo’s expansion in Japan in return.</p>

<p>Founded in Taiwan, awoo is an AI-driven Martech platform aiming to deliver integrated marketing services focusing on traffic growth automation, SEO automation, conversion optimisation, remarketing, and customer digital experience.</p>

<p>Awoo’s nununi is a CXO platform that connects touchpoints between behavior understanding and product comprehension. With AI, Nununi analyzes and interprets Google’s search intent – meaning a user’s ultimate purpose when they enter a query on a search engine – and directs users to landing pages and tags tied to consumer behavior.</p>

<p>The AI-powered solution also combines various marketing tools through AI tags, which potentially doubles or triples product web views while creating a seamless online and offline customer experience.</p>

<p>Speaking of the partnership, awoo founder and CEO Jose Lin commented, “This partnership with Repro is our first step in grooming a Martech ecosystem in Asia.”</p>

<p>Established in Tokyo in 2014, Repro is a CEP that serves more than 7,300 corporate clients across 66 countries. Harnessing omnichannel data, Repro analyzes customer viewing and spending habits and delivers more personalized messages.</p>

<p>“In Taiwan, e-commerce penetration rate is high and mobile app usage is prevalent. In addition, this year’s pandemic has accelerated the entire e-commerce industry. I foresee vast potential in Taiwan’s e-commerce market,” Satoshi Kawashima, Repro’s chief revenue officer for Asia-Pacific, said.</p>

<p>He added that when companies adopt personalised marketing tools, they often overwhelm consumers with messages, which negatively affects how consumers perceive the brand.</p>

<p>In light of this, Repro first identifies customers’ needs and then develops a marketing strategy. The customer satisfaction consulting service, which will be debuted in Taiwan by the end of the year, help marketers send their message to target customers when they are the most receptive.</p>

<p>Moving forward, awoo told <em>Meet</em> that the company hopes to expand its footprint to other countries in Southeast Asia in addition to Japan and eventually become a one-stop digital marketing solution provider.</p>

<p>Besides Repro, awoo is also forging partnership with several Martech solution providers in Japan, perfecting the customer journey from first interaction and onward.</p>

<p>To support the growing Martech ecosystem, the startup is regularly co-hosting seminars, webinars, and publishing <a href="https://www.awoo.com.tw/whitepaper/" title="https://www.awoo.com.tw/whitepaper/">whitepapers</a>.</p>

<p>In September 2019, awoo <a href="https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/business/indep/1000073" title="https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/business/indep/1000073">announced partnership</a> with three other Martech startups in Taiwan, namely iKala, CloudAD, and Crescendo Lab, to establish a Martech ecosystem in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Awoo is known for rejecting the biggest Chinese internet giants. About a decade after founding awoo, Lin was approached by Jack Ma from Alibaba Group and China’s largest search engine Baidu for collaboration separately, according to <em><a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/10/31/2003681378" title="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/10/31/2003681378">Taipei Times</a></em>. He rejected both of them and collected about US$1 million from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs as he was determined to make awoo a household name globally without Chinese influence.</p>

	<a href="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/" title="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/"></a> said on July 13 it plans to start raising a total of $6.8 million (NT$2 billion) for two new funds of the same size by the end of 2020 to help Taiwanese startups enter global markets.</p>

<p>Seeing a gap between seed and Series A rounds in Taiwan’s investment scene, the venture capital firm said it decided to pump money into startups in Pre Series-A round with the two funds, said David Weng, CEO of Taiwania Capital.</p>

<p>He believes if venture capitalists can come in and support startups at their earlier stage of development, they can help shape business models, manage the team, and build business development.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017, Taiwania Capital is funded by the National Development Fund (NDF) of Taiwan, the Industrial Technology Investment Corporation (ITIC) and the Bank of Taiwan. Previously, the firm has launched a $150 million fund for IoT and cloud technologies and a $200 million fund for medical technologies.</p>

<p>With the two new funds, Taiwania Capital plans to invest in startup companies building AI and IoT integrated solutions as well as innovative medical devices.</p>

</figure>

<p>For the latter fund, Taiwania Capital said it will help introduce locally developed medical devices to international markets.</p>

<p>Medical devices and drug development are two pillars of Taiwan’s medical industry, said Jerome Shen, head of life science investments at Taiwania Capital. “Taiwan is in an advantageous position in both areas,” despite the stark difference in their phases of development, product cycle, and compliances.</p>

<p>As a VC firm that goes through more than 300 proposals every year, Weng said the coronavirus pandemic has not become an obstacle for them to invest in startups with great potential. Instead, it has led an increasing number of startups to consider setting up their Asian headquarter in Taiwan -- due to its effective response to the virus.</p>

<h2>What Taiwania Capital has backed</h2>

<p>With the two existing funds, Taiwania Capital has made 24 investments, as revealed on its <a href="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/portfolio/" title="https://en.taiwaniacapital.com/portfolio/">official website</a>. This year, the firm has made five investments so far, including four in the United States. It has recently led the $14.5 million <a href="https://w.dspconcepts.com/series-b" title="https://w.dspconcepts.com/series-b">Series B funding round of DSP Concepts</a> in February. Taiwanese fabless semiconductor company MediaTek, BMW, Porsche, and Sony. The startup, who is developing a software for audio signal processing and audio algorithms, opened an office in Taiwan after the investment.</p>

<p>Since its launch, Taiwania Capital has been actively investing in companies with pioneering technology. It also brings overseas startups to Taiwan to grow their presence in Asia. For example, it has led the Series B funding of <a href="https://arriscomposites.com/" title="https://arriscomposites.com/">Arris Composite</a>s in April this year. The California-based carbon fiber manufacturer <a href="https://arriscomposites.com/press/arris-composites-secures-48-5m/" title="https://arriscomposites.com/press/arris-composites-secures-48-5m/">said</a> it will use the proceeds to open facilities in Taiwan to serve the demand from the consumer electronics industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fractyl.com/" title="https://www.fractyl.com/">Fractyl</a> is another name Taiwania Capital includes in their medical technology portfolio. The company focuses on advancing treatments and potential cures for metabolic diseases by rejuvenating the lining of the duodenum. Taiwanese manufacturers may join in producing the devices used during minimally invasive surgery.</p>

<p>Taiwania Capital also invested in and formed a partnership with <a href="https://landing.ai/" title="https://landing.ai/">Landing AI</a>, who provides AI solutions for enterprises to evaluate their business models. The California-based startup is the hard work of Andrew Ng, the founder of the Google Brain deep learning project and the co-founder of Coursera. The <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20200710005657-260410?chdtv" title="https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20200710005657-260410?chdtv">partnership</a> helps bring the service to Taiwan business for easier transition in business operation.</p>

It is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the body’s innate biology to repair or reverse damage caused by a broad range of degenerative diseases.

His original background is in business management. &ldquo;When dentists communicate with each other, they use terminologies such as prophylaxis, prosthesis, interproximal and you will think to yourself, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;, said Tsou. So, that was the impetus: giving him a thirst for learning, including equipment, practices, terminologies, and processes; and gaining a deep understanding of it -all in less than a month. As well as traveling back and forth either from Taipei to Xizi or Taipei to Taitung to demonstrate and sell dental equipment to potential customers. Here, Tsou reminds us of Satya Nedella&rsquo;s quote, &ldquo;Be passionate and bold. Always keep learning. You stop doing useful things if you do not learn&rdquo;. Tsou is not merely learning Taiwan&rsquo;s dental ecosystem, but also seizing the opportunity for reinvention. It was not as much a decision to become an entrepreneur as it was merely a realization that is what Tsou was meant to do.</p><p><strong>Tsou and Ho: The Peanut Butter and Jelly</strong><br>It all started with two words- holy moly, enough to break the ice with his co-founder, Frederick Ho. The boys met through their military service in Taiwan. Tsou completed his primary education in Auckland, New Zealand, and followed grandma back to Taipei, Taiwan. On the other hand, Ho obtained his degree in Industrial Designing from the University of South Australia. Tsou spoke about why he and Ho complement each other so well: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of the task-oriented versus people-oriented personality spectrum. I am a people-oriented person, he is strongly task-oriented. I place more importance on the feelings and happiness of people. He makes sure we all are productive and efficient.&rdquo; Applying Chef Justin Warner&rsquo;s &ldquo;the law of peanut butter and jelly&rdquo;. The author thinks that Ho is the peanut butter and Tsou is the jelly. Ho gives the sandwich a smooth creamy texture with a touch of sweetness from Tsou. All these gloriousness are held together by the team. The combination is basic yet delicious and content.</p><p><strong>Which came first: the customer segmentation or the value proposition?</strong><br>Formosation Oral Tech<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is in the process of discovering and fine-tuning its business model. The process involves frequent contact with their mentors: STARTBOARD, LINE product manager, INTEL outlook customer manager, to name a few. And also, learning through pitching competitions. Since almost everything is built from scratch, the process of fine-tuning can apply to all facets of the startup. Personally, Tsou sheds light on these facets: customer segmentation, value proposition, and channel. He asked, &ldquo;the egg and the chicken, which came first? Or which is more important?&rdquo; He further explained, &ldquo;you have to define the value proposition of your products, then you will know who your target audience is or vice versa- you identify your target customer, then tailor your product accordingly. So, both are crucial.&rdquo; The target audience of Formosation Oral Tech is the dental clinic dentist. According to the research Cheng et al. (2020) had done, the northern region of Taiwan and Taipei City had 52.81% (7829/14,825) and 22.29% (3304/14,825) of the total number of dentists in 2019, respectively. To sum up this section: Chosen correctly, that one thing will set off a domino effect that leads you to success.</p><p><strong>AntiQ = Floss + App</strong><br>He continued, &ldquo;dentists will clean patients&rsquo; teeth and check for cavities and gum disease during a dental exam. After the exam, they will discuss patients&rsquo; oral health conditions and suggest some preventive practices patients can take to protect their oral health. However, dentists rarely prescribe drugs to their patients. This clearly shows that like other areas of the body, our mouth teems with bacteria, mostly harmless. In other words, good oral health care such as daily brushing and flossing will keep bacteria from turning virulent.&rdquo; Research indicated that 95% of Taiwanese brush daily. However, less than 30% of Taiwanese floss regularly, and a whopping 70% or more do not floss at all. This raises the question of &ldquo;why are people against flossing?&rdquo; There are three main reasons: (1) &ldquo;traditional dental floss user-unfriendly&rdquo;, 70%; (2) &ldquo;gap between teeth getting bigger&rdquo; or &ldquo;bleeding gums&rdquo;, 60%; and (3) &ldquo;do I need to floss my teeth?&rdquo;, 50%.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/a3c/a3d/536/a3ca3d53670bde97933c85f3c595c61ea9f3494e.jpg" style="width: 900px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p><strong>Meet the team&nbsp;</strong>: Federick, Jacob and Ivan (from left to right)<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>Formosation Oral Tech<strong>&nbsp;</strong>came out with a new product called AntiQ which has the ability to tackle the above-mentioned problems.

<p>Founded in 2019, TAcc+ is an accelerator program supported by the Small and Medium Business Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Below are three startups from TAcc+, who have built solid business models and industry connections through the program.</p>

<p><strong>ConnSante Biotech</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.connsante.com/EN/index.html" title="http://www.connsante.com/EN/index.html">ConnSante Biotech</a> conducts comprehensive assessments on body cells and molecules of the immune and tissue repair systems for signals of cancer cells. The check-ups include detecting the molecular, cell and systemic aberrant signal of the immune and tissue repair system involved in the tumorigenesis and cancer progression.</p>

<p>Based on the research studies at National Tsinghua University (NTHU), carcinogen can grow for up to 10 years before causing physical symptoms and one single cancer cell does not necessarily turn into a tumor.</p>

<p>By maintaining proper conditions for cells, an estimation of 80% patients can be cured even if they are exposed to high risk cancers in stomach or liver. The research team at ConnSante Biotech has been working with the National Taiwan University Hospital on almost 2,000 clinical researches and discovered multiple decisive factors on cancer recurrence. The team stressed much on monitoring the development of possible cancer cells and wants to nip them in the bud.</p>

<p>ConnSante Biotech focuses on strengthening people’s “cancer-prevention capability.” The team believes everyone is a “cancer suspect” and it is best to understand people’s tumor related status before it is too late.</p>

<p><strong>Soteria Biotech</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://soteriabio.com/" title="http://soteriabio.com/">Soteria Biotech</a> develops innovative medical solutions and products for sleeping disorders like obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). One of them is “Soteria One Point Zero”, a cloud based stand-alone software platform; it shows and analyzes patients’ head and neck stock images for airway flow characteristics, helping physicians decide whether their airways are obstructed and, if so, at which location.</p>

<p>“Approximately 80% of the world’s population have OSAS but are yet to be confirmed,” said Honda Hsiao, the CEO of Soteria Biotech. “The service can help quadruple the amount of confirmed cases annually, from 50,000 to 200,000 with an 88% accuracy,” Hsiao continued. “As the database keeps building up, doctors can find their patients to find a more suitable mouthpiece to enhance the effectiveness of treatments engaged.”</p>

<p>Traditionally, patients with OSAS need to go through a series of complicated nocturnal monitoring of respiratory and cardiac parameters with a sleep specialist. Those checkings may involve examinations on patients’ throat, mouth and nose with measurement neck circumference and blood pressure. It is a long test before patients can confirm their status. In addition, physical therapy and surgery are most commonly used to treat the syndrome, but some patients find the physical treatments cumbersome and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The company has, therefore, developed the Soteria OA (obstructive apnea) Solution, an analytical system for adjusting snoring mouthpiece with tomographic images. The solution has been granted <a href="http://soteriabio.com/about/" title="http://soteriabio.com/about/">patents</a> from the United States, Taiwan, Singapore and China. Soteria Biotech is now working with dental laboratories and breather manufacturers and expecting to sign partnership with dentist clinics this year.</p>

<p><strong>WellGen Medical</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wellgen.info/en-home" title="https://www.wellgen.info/en-home">WellGen Medical</a> creates automated microscopes for tuberculosis detection to replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for quicker testing and higher accuracy.</p>

<p>PCR is a widely used laboratory technique for making millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample rapidly at a lower cost, allowing scientists to take a small sample of DNA and compare it with the DNA samples of known tuberculosis DNA patterns. Currently, doctors need five minutes on average to go through each sample, which means 80 to 100 cases on a daily basis.</p>

<p>With WellGen’s automated microscope, the assessment time for each sample is now at two mintues with accuracy of 85% to 90%. By using the automated microscopes, physicians can avoid spending time going through all samples manually.</p>

<p>WellGen also provides a system that accepts the intra- and inter-laboratory variations in staining methodology techniques. The system collects all data and stores them in the database with different combinations of diagnosis results. With cloud computing, the analysis software can update and improve the detection accuracy as the number of samples accumulates.</p>

	<a href="https://www.klook.com/zh-TW/" title="https://www.klook.com/zh-TW/"></a>, a travel booking startup based in Hong Kong, announced a layoff of 160 employees or nearly 9% of its workforce, in a note written by co-founder and CEO Ethan Lin.</p>

<p>Klook will cut 46 jobs in its Taiwan office, representing almost one third of the layoff.</p>

<p>In general, the customer support and operation teams in Taiwan and Malaysia are the most affected by the decision. Meanwhile, part of the business development teams in Japan, Europe and the US were cut and the office in India was closed.</p>

<p>“We are seeing signs of recovery in some markets. However, we are still far away from pre-COVID-19 levels,” Lin wrote to his staff.</p>

<p>He said the resurgence of coronavirus cases in Hong Kong and Australia signaled that “the road to recovery is fragile” and Klook does not know “when travel will resume in full force.”</p>

<p>Travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. In May, Uber and Airbnb also announced their layoff plans, slashing workforce by 14% and 25% respectively.</p>

<h2>Taiwan office took a hard hit</h2>

<p>Last year, Klook expanded its staff in Taiwan as part of the plan to <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45250" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45250">build a large online customer service center</a> to help travelers in 11 languages. But the demand for such assistance has dropped significantly since countries around the world started imposing travel restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>“With travel restrictions still in place, the volume of travelers today is nowhere near the levels from 2019,” Lin wrote in the note.</p>

<p>Klook has tried different approaches to offset the loss in the whole pandemic swirl, including promoting domestic trips and stay-at-home experiences.</p>

<p>“Travel bubble is an alternative we are looking forward to, but it seems like countries are making slow progress. The travel industry may go back to normal only after an effective vaccine is available in the market” Lin said.</p>

<p>Travel bubble is an agreement between a set of countries to open their borders exclusively to each other.</p>

<h2>What’s next for ex-Klookers</h2>

<p>Klook provides a generous package to the staff the company is letting go. They will receive an extra severance pay on top of local labor law standard and continue to receive healthcare coverage. They are also allowed access to Klook’s employee assistance program and keep the company-issued laptops for job seeking.</p>

<p>The benefit Klook offers is not unprecedented. Earlier in May, when Airbnb announced its layoff, it provided a 14-weeks of base pay with one extra week for every year of experience at the company. Ex-employees are also entitled to their healthcare coverage throughout 2020.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ttgasia.com/2020/04/21/klook-trims-workforce-impose-pay-cuts-to-ride-out-covid-19-storm/" title="https://www.ttgasia.com/2020/04/21/klook-trims-workforce-impose-pay-cuts-to-ride-out-covid-19-storm/">Since April</a>, Klook has been taking measures to reduce costs. While cutting approximately 10% to 20% of its total headcount, the company has implemented a temporarily reduced workweek across the organization. CEO Ethan Lin and other senior leaders <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/klook-reduce-headcount-forgo-founders-salaries-weather-covid-19" title="https://www.techinasia.com/klook-reduce-headcount-forgo-founders-salaries-weather-covid-19">have also stopped</a> receiving their pay “until the end of the crisis.”</p>

<p>Last year, Klook raised a $225 million Series D+ funding round led by Softbank’s Vision Fund. The company <a href="https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/3236930" title="https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/3236930">said</a> it has been reserving the proceeds and will explore new business opportunities while tackling challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>As a professor of mechanical engineering, he has led the <a href="https://arrc.tw/" title="https://arrc.tw/">Advanced Rocket Research Center</a> (ARRC) at National Chiao-Tung University to launch the first hybrid rocket successfully in 2014. Flying to a height of ten kilometers, HTTP-3S stayed in the air for around ten minutes to carry out measurements and send them back to the ground in real time.</p>

<p>But Wu’s new rocket is different. Instead of a instrument-carrying rocket, HTTP-3A is similar to a launch vehicle that blasts satellites into low-earth orbit, only smaller in size. He expects to launch this rocket next summer. If succeeded, it will be a huge step for Taiwan to the future of sending objects into orbit independently on domestically built rockets.</p>

<p>Now, Taiwan is still dependent on foreign rockets and launchpads to send satellites into space. In June, Formosat-7, the constellation of six satellites jointly built by Taiwan and the US, was <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3731695" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3731695">launched by a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket</a> from the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>

<p>To continue developing and testing HTTP-3A, specifically its upper stage engine that propels the rocket in space, Wu is now seeking financial support from the people who want to be part of <a href="https://crowdfunding2020.arrc.tw/" title="https://crowdfunding2020.arrc.tw/">the ambitious project</a>.</p>

<p>“You can sometimes be so much ahead of the government and the private sector that they refuse to buy into your idea,” he talks about his crowdfunding attempt in 2015. “But those who are on the same page will find you on crowdfunding platforms.”</p>

<p>Five years ago, Wu has raised around NT$12 million ($408,000) via crowdfunding and later founded <a href="http://www.tispace.com/" title="http://www.tispace.com/">Taiwan Innovative Space Inc.</a> (TiSPACE) with his students to enter the crowded market of small satellite launch, the first private company in Taiwan specializing in space technologies.</p>

<p>TiSPACE came under spotlight in February for the proposed launch of Hapith-1, Taiwan’s first domestically built rocket. The liftoff was aborted <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/14/2003730963" title="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/14/2003730963">due to bad weather conditions</a>.</p>

<p>Despite ending up leaving the company in 2018, Wu considers his two years running the company to be invaluable. “Leaving the academia, I had the opportunity to meet with top professionals in the industry of spacecraft production, and that confirmed my belief that Taiwan has the capability to build its own rocket,” he says.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, Wu says there are suppliers of almost all types of components used in rocket construction, from heat-proof materials for engine nozzles to liquid oxidizers. Unknown to the world, they develop technologies that can be applied across the globe.</p>

<p>“This wouldn’t be possible without a robust semiconductor industry,” he <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2">adds</a>. “Some materials like the concentrated hydrogen peroxide used for cleaning silicon wafers often come in handy for us.”</p>

<p>What’s more, the island is ideal <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46716" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46716">as a launch site due to its proximity of the equator</a>, where the surface of the Earth rotates at the highest speed, making it easier for a rocket to reach the velocity required to achieve orbit.</p>

<p>Returning to the academia, Wu continues to pursue his dream to put Taiwan on the map of the global space industry, which currently <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space" title="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space">generates more than $350 billion</a> in economic output and is forecast to value at $1 trillion in 2040.</p>

<p>Because of its size, his latest rocket, HTTP-3A, isn’t yet able to send satellites into orbit, but he says its propulsion, avionics, communications systems are all comparable to those of launch vehicles, and if everything goes well with the development, they believe they can propel the rocket to a height of 100 kilometers in 2021.</p>

<p>Two to three years after the launch, we may see the first MIT (made-in-Taiwan) carrier rocket sent to the space, he claims.</p>

<p>“If you have a chance to see a rocket launch on site, you will be moved to tears,” Wu <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/58245/arrc-crowdfunding-round-2">says</a>. “If we can launch rockets on our own, it will be an honor for the people of Taiwan.”</p>

<p>Speaking of the crowdfunding project, Wu believes it is just the beginning of the story. “Our goal is to let everyone around the world know Taiwan can achieve what many believe to be impossible,” he proudly says.</p>

<p>Deriving from the word “impact,” IMPCT <a href="https://bricks.impct.co/faq" title="https://bricks.impct.co/faq">stands for the right for all children</a> in the world to receive a quality education and enjoy a brighter future. The missing letter “a” <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/201902090020.aspx" title="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/201902090020.aspx">represents the absence of action</a> in today’s world.</p>

<p>"Everyone needs to get involved to create influence," IMPCT’s cofounder Chen An-nung <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018" title="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018">said</a>.</p>

<h2>Winning the US$ 1 million Hult prize</h2>

<p>In 2014, Chen was a fresh graduate of the International Master of Business Administration at National Chengchi University in Taipei. She and three classmates from Canada, Honduras, El Salvador formed a team to vie for the Hult Prize, a global competition for social impact projects and was awarded US$1 million to turn their idea into reality.</p>

<p>But at first, their project was not a big hit. Several professional advisers <a href="https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/80481?page=1" title="https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/80481?page=1">called it impossible</a> due to legal constraints and foreseeable execution challenges.</p>

<p>Despite being eliminated in stage two, Chen’s team <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/30/444752368/they-had-a-million-dollar-idea-about-better-day-care-in-urban-slums" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/30/444752368/they-had-a-million-dollar-idea-about-better-day-care-in-urban-slums">did not give up on their idea</a> and quickly raised around US$58,000 on the American crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to build the first early childhood education center in La Chuchilla, El Salvador. They also partnered with local NGOs to upskill a caregiver in the community, so parents can get a full-time job without worrying about their kids.</p>

<p>Impressed by their achievement, the judges of the Hult Prize decided to bring them back to the competition and crown the team as the global champion.</p>

<p>“Our model, at a basic level, involves investing in women already running informal daycares to transform those into real schools that they own and operate — new facility, materials, teacher training, community/government outreach, ongoing support,” IMPCT’s cofounder Taylor Scobbie <a href="https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/06/12/maximum-impct-coffee-enterprise-using-beans-as-a-means-for-education-at-origin/" title="https://dailycoffeenews.com/2019/06/12/maximum-impct-coffee-enterprise-using-beans-as-a-means-for-education-at-origin/">said</a>.</p>

<p>“We bring the capital and partners required to make those all happen and act as project managers for the implementation.”</p>

<h2>Selling fair trade&nbsp;coffee in developing countries</h2>

<p>To grow sustainably, IMPCT turned their attention to coffee. With the mission to build more early childhood centers in urban slums globally at the back of their mind, IMPCT launched the “Coffee for the future” program to allow people around the world to buy bags of coffee beans from developing countries like Honduras and Guatemala and contribute to local school construction.</p>

<p>The packaging of the coffee products was designed to look like a brick, <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018" title="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201706150018">symbolizing that each purchase is a brick</a> to build a better future.</p>

<p>Customers can scan a code inside the coffee box and <a href="https://bricks.impct.co/" title="https://bricks.impct.co">pick a preschool</a> they hope to help build Montessori preschools in Latin America founded by IMPCT that upskill local women as school owners and provide education to children. When the school is built, they receive a notification.</p>

<p>The program is beneficial to coffee farmers living in developing countries, who often earn too little to make ends meet while large coffee companies engaging in greenwashing are raking it in.</p>

<p>While 25% of the revenue goes towards building schools and nurturing low income women, 20% goes to the coffee farmers and 15% of the profit is invested in collaborative local roasting.</p>

<h2>Same goal, new approach</h2>

<p>When IMPCT was building schools in Latin America, they were <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657">contemplating how they could give back to Taiwan</a>. The team planned a visit to numerous areas in Taiwan such as Pingtung and Hsinchu to investigate whether they can apply what they did in Honduras, Guatemala, and South Africa to Taiwan.</p>

<p>During their trip, they realized right away that the early education scene in Taiwan is completely different from Latin America or Africa. Many schools in the rural areas were closing because there were not enough admissions.</p>

<p>They started thinking what the community really needs and how they can help. They came up with an idea: selling local farmers’ products and returning the profits to the community.</p>

<p>IMPCT first <a href="https://npost.tw/archives/29087" title="https://npost.tw/archives/29087">partnered</a> with local farmers living in rural areas and jam brand Red On Tree to upcycle unsold fruits into jams and sell them in flea markets. The company then reached out to Taipei City Government to kickstart a campaign wading into a social issue: the diminishing cultural identity of aboriginal tribes in Taiwan. They started a course for children aged between three and six about the traditions and cultures of 16 Taiwanese aboriginal tribes.</p>

<figure>Impct / Photograph: Facebook fanpage</figure>

<p>The company also <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46657">partnered with Taipei 101 and Taisugar</a> as their marketing consultant to help them give back to the community of their choice. For example, IMPCT and Taisugar renovated and transformed a school in Honduras into a secondary school that offers standard academic courses, career planning and leadership training sessions.</p>

<h2>Broadening the landscape of impact trading</h2>

<p>With more and more businesses approaching IMPCT to develop ways to fulfill their corporate social responsibility, the company has a new business idea.</p>

<p>It will launch an e-commerce platform to help companies fulfill their CSR goals in a simpler way: They can sell their own products online, and 10%-25% of the profit will be used to support a social cause.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, customers decide where the money goes. They can invest it in areas such as early education, environment, food safety, and so on.</p>

<p>“We hope consumers and corporates can choose to support a social cause they care about and see how their purchase helps others,” IMPCT’s general manager Jessi Fu said. “For corporates, one major benefit of our e-commerce platform is that they can focus solely on developing high-quality products instead of allocating resources to CSR projects.”</p>

<p>With IMPCT’s new platform, more and more people will be involved in impact trading and understand what type of impact they can make on others’ lives.</p>

<p>“The US has already initiated a movement to move the conversation on sustainability forward to impact trade. It may take Taiwan two to three years to acknowledge its importance, but we believe the COVID-19 is a catalyst for consumers to change their mentality and for us as a business to explore e-commerce,” Fu said.</p>

<p>Established in 2015, MPS Energy is part of the laptop maker’s foray into the vehicle electricity and mobile power field, and has dedicated its resources to the development of battery management systems for smart bikes.</p>

<p>MPS Energy offers customized design of battery packs for electric bikes. Users can install those battery packs on the rear rack, down or seat tubes of their bikes. Besides batteries for e-bikes, the company also produces those for e-scooters and electric all-terrain vehicles.</p>

<p>Jason Chen, CEO of Acer, <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46744" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46744">pointed out</a> an advantage of riding an e-bike is that users can continue their trips while giving their knackered legs a break. MPS Energy’s battery modules pair with detectors for managing battery level and recording trip mileages.</p>

<p>Recently, MPS Energy also announced that it has joined Bosch and Panasonic to become the only three battery manufacturers to have entered the EU market and met its standard. “We are so excited to be put on the same level as Bosch and Panasonic,” said Chen.</p>

<p>So far, the battery modules from MPS Energy are certified by Taiwan’s CNS 15387, ISO 13849 and EU’s EN 1519:2017.</p>

<h2>E-Bike has been the trend</h2>

<p>In recent years, global markets see an increasing demand for light electric vehicles (LEV). The amount of electric two- and three-wheelers grows from 160 million in 2015 to over 240 million in 2019, according to a <a href="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2020/page/4/1?teaser=yes" title="https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo-2020/page/4/1?teaser=yes">Bloomberg report</a>. The production of scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles are already going electric quickly and will accelerate further in the next ten years, the same report added.</p>

<p>Bloomberg estimates the share of electric two-wheeler sales in the LEV market will reach 77% in 2040 while 30% of existing sales are already electric globally. China accounts for the major two-wheeler electrification so far but sales are growing rapidly in markets like Taiwan, Vietnam and India.</p>

<p>In Asia, Taiwanese e-bike producers such as Giants, Merida and Fairly have been key players for decades, according to the <a href="https://levassociation.com/2020/05/03/micro-mobility-market-report-2019-2020-winter-spring/" title="https://levassociation.com/2020/05/03/micro-mobility-market-report-2019-2020-winter-spring/">report by Light Electric Vehicle Association</a>. But new entrants are shaking up the industry in recent years. <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/" title="https://www.gogoro.com/">Gogoro</a>, who is known for its sleek e-scooters, has launched <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2020/07/02/2003739192" title="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2020/07/02/2003739192">its first e-bike named Eeyo</a> this year, in New York and later in France and Taiwan. Dutch e-bike brand <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-NL" title="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-NL">Vanmoof</a> has <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46658" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/46658">teamed up with Sinbon Electronics</a>, a Taiwanese company offering electronic components, for its production assembly and has set up its retail presence in Taiwan since 2012.</p>

<p>Batteries serve as a decisive factor in the design and performance of electric vehicles, which could lead to a different market offering, according to <a href="http://www.acqiche.com/download/deloitte-uk-battery-electric-vehicles.pdf" title="http://www.acqiche.com/download/deloitte-uk-battery-electric-vehicles.pdf">Deloitte</a>. Enterprises who would like to establish their presence in the LEV market would increase its reliance on Asian battery manufacturers on supplier arrangements as most battery packs are produced in Asia.</p>

<p>“In Taiwan, it usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes to perform a nasal swab test. Many medical workers decide not to go to the toilet for four hours just to avoid putting on and taking off their heavy hazmat suits,” said Jerry Chen, Brain Navi’s founder and CEO.</p>

<p>The robot locates a person’s nostril, inserts a long swab into it, collects the fluid, and transfers it into a closed container. All the work is done without human assistance.</p>

<p>Even though medical workers still need to get close to help positioning the patient into a head holder, they can later supervise the entire procedure at ease behind a transparent panel.</p>

<p>Brain Navi’s robot also prevents medical workers from causing discomfort to their patients. Instead of deciding how far to insert the swab based on experience, they can simply rely on the robot, which scans the patients’ facial structure to locate the exact spot to collect the fluid.</p>

<p>Chen added the positioning error of the robot is smaller than 2mm.</p>

<p>This new device is based on several fundamental functions of Brain Navi’s previous neurosurgical navigation robot NaoTrac. Combining the use of machine vision, AI, and robotic techniques, it’s an autopilot brain surgical robot that tracks anatomical locations and handles instructments accurately. It has successfully performed 15 human trial cases in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Chen, a former surgeon, has an extensive background in medicine and biomedical engineering and an avid interest in finding solutions for modern problems.</p>

<p>“I like to invent something to improve medical processes. I am the kind of person that is not satisfied by current solutions,” Chen said.</p>

<p>“We’re looking to global markets. We have very strong technologies. We have the devices. We are looking for connections and investors all around the world so we can expand outside of Taiwan.”</p>

<p>On 26-27 August, more than 40 participants from Chinese Taipei, Indonesia and other APEC economies connected through their digital devices and took part in the "APEC Women-Led Start-Up Accelerator Workshop". Despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA), Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Chinese Taipei and Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (CSMEs) of Indonesia successfully co-hosted this event through virtual means, signifying the bonds and connections between APEC economies, SMEs and women entrepreneurs will not be broken by the COVID-19 pandemic.
	<br>The participants of the event were mostly women entrepreneurs who came from various backgrounds including NGOs, industries, policy makers and start-ups from the APEC economies. Together these key stakeholders shared their experiences and insights on how to empower female entrepreneurs, strengthening the cooperation among SMEs in APEC.</p>

<p><strong>Empowering Women and Building Capacities</strong>
	<br>The workshop began with opening remarks delivered by Ms. Pei-Ti Hu, Deputy Director General of SMEA, MOEA and Mr. Hanung Harimba Rachman, Deputy Minister for Financing of CSMEs. "As women entrepreneurs\'&nbsp;role in economic development become more and more important, it is clear that every government need to ensure a gender friendly entrepreneurial environment in their respective economies,"&nbsp;said Ms. Pei-Ti Hu.
	<br>"We know that the potential of women entrepreneurs has not yet been fully unleashed, and that by empowering women entrepreneurs in the APEC economies, we can contribute to the region\'s overall inclusive growth and share prosperity,"&nbsp;continued Ms. Hu, as she stressed the importance of women empowerment and the essential goal of the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative</strong>
	<br>Although women\'s capability on access to market and capital in the APEC region has improved over the years, it was shown on a 2019 report by the APEC policy support unit that in terms of capital access, it is still harder for women to access credit in comparison to men; while in terms of market access, women\'s entry still faces regulatory and legal barriers.
	<br>With the goal to increase women\'s access to capital and market, Chinese Taipei, co-sponsored by Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines proposed the APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative. This workshop is the first event held under the initiative. A second workshop will be hosted in October in Malaysia, followed by a third workshop to be hosted in November in Taipei. Finally, a concluding APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Forum will be hosted in November in Taipei.
	<br>Through these events, Chinese Taipei will continue to strive for women\'s empowerment and for the advancement of women\'s economic participation to create a more enabling environment toward inclusive growth.</p>

<p>The signing ceremony took place in the presence of Miloš Vystrčil, President of the Czech Senate; Wang Mei-Hua, Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in Taiwan; and Kung Ming-Hsin, Minister of the National Development Council in Taiwan.</p>

<p>According to the document, Business Next is inviting Czech startup companies to <a href="https://meettaipei.tw/" title="https://meettaipei.tw/">Meet Taipei</a>, the annual startup exhibition it organizes in November, and helping them connect with their Taiwanese counterparts to explore possible ways of business collaboration.</p>

<p>Katie Chen, CEO of Business Next, said she expects the Taiwan startup ecosystem to be a bridge for Taiwan’s economic cooperation with the Czech Republic, facilitating communication between investors, enterprises, and startup companies from the two countries.</p>

<p>The MoU, along with two others on smart city and smart manufacturing signed in the forum, is a boost to the already-close economic relations between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>“Despite the geographical distance, Taiwan has had strong ties with the Czech Republic for the past 25 years,” Ms. Wang said in her opening remarks of the forum. “Many Taiwanese ICT companies like Foxconn, for example, have invested and set up operations in the Czech Republic years ago for its high-end labor pool.” Others include laptop makers Asus and Acer.</p>

<p>In 2018, the minister led a delegation to Prague to discuss how Taiwan and the Czech Republic can work together in areas like smart city, circular economy, and green energy.</p>

<p>To encourage trade and investment, the two countries have signed a tax treaty to prevent double taxation in May. Czech Republic is now <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3948066" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3948066">Taiwan’s fourth largest investment destination in Europe</a>, following Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, according to statistics from the MOEA.</p>

<p>Vystrčil, in his remarks, said one of the main goals of his five-day trip is to connect Czech and Taiwanese companies and plant the seeds for future collaborations.</p>

<p>“Democracy and freedom are the foundation for prosperity,” he said. Sharing similar values, Vystrčil believes the two countries have great potential to deepen cooperation in trade and investment.</p>

<p>The Taiwan-Czech Republic forum was held a day after the Czech Senate leader arrived in Taiwan, which started the highest level visit to Taiwan by Czech government officials in the history of the bilateral relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>Vystrčil and his delegation that includes Zdeněk Hřib, Mayor of Prague, fellow lawmakers, and business representatives were received at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport by Joseph Wu, Minister of Foreign Affairs. They are <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3998011" title="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3998011">scheduled to meet with President Tsai</a> and members of the Cabinet in the following days of their trip.</p>

<p>In response, <a href="https://aifatechnology.com/" title="https://aifatechnology.com/">AIFA Technology</a> (AIFA), a former ODM for remote controls, transformed their business and started their home brand. The company based in Kaohsiung is most renowned for its smart home wireless remote control named i-Ctrl, a product that won the <a href="https://www.taiwanexcellence.org/tw/award/product/38410" title="https://www.taiwanexcellence.org/tw/award/product/38410">Taiwan Excellence Award 2018</a> and <a href="https://www.german-design-award.com/en/the-winners/gallery/detail/29604-i-ctrl-the-wireless-smart-home-device.html" title="https://www.german-design-award.com/en/the-winners/gallery/detail/29604-i-ctrl-the-wireless-smart-home-device.html">German Design Award 2020</a>.</p>

<p>“When Taiwan is no longer an empire of ODM/OEM, small and middle-sized enterprises usually face one problem: not knowing how to push forward their existing brands and services to the market,” said Ni Wen-lu, founder and CEO at AIFA.</p>

<p>“How do you bring the public\'s attention to your products? That is the key to success. Most companies in Taiwan spend their time on their products, but they need to realize it is also important to think about how to market and sell them.”</p>

<p>To AIFA, it means crowdfunding. The company launched its first crowdfunding campaign of a battery saver on flyingV, a Taiwanese fundraising platform, in 2016. Despite failure to meet the funding goal, the team bounced back in summer and soon launched its second crowdfunding project to finance i-Ctrl.</p>

<p>The wireless remote control i-Ctrl has sensors that send and receive signals in a 360 degree radius. This allows users to control all home devices, such as air conditioners, curtains, lamps, and TV, on their phone or through voice commands in the distance.</p>

<p>The company, hitting its funding goal of NT$50,000 (US$1,703), raised NT$758,000 (US$25,817).</p>

<p>“As an ODM, it was hard for us to communicate with end users, and their comments about the products we designed and manufactured would never reach us,” Ni said.</p>

<p>Through crowdfunding, they build a bridge to consumers. It allows them to collect real-time feedback from customers and respond to their requests in an agile manner.</p>

<p>Because of the two-way communication, AIFA found out that i-Ctrl is used not only at homes but hospitals and hostels. With the product, nurses turn on lights and cameras remotely in the intensive care unit so families can video call the patient who is not well enough for a face-to-face chat. Hostel owners save money on their electric bill by monitoring and turning off air-conditioners that are not in use through i-Ctrl.</p>

<p>In 2020, AIFA launched its third crowdfunding product i-Ctrl Pro. The updated version of i-Ctrl analyzes and records user data to automatically adjust temperature and humidity. Through its mobile app, users can turn off the television that they forget to turn off and schedule various presets adjusting the temperature or humidity level for every occasion.</p>

	<figcaption>AIFA launched i-Ctrl Pro on flyingV this June, four years after its first model i-Ctrl. / Photograph : FlyingV</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>AIFA has also developed its own IoT database for local infrared devices, so i-Ctrl Pro can consolidate and activate the remote control functions of infrared home devices from most brands.</p>

<p>Ni shared the reason behind. One of the top concerns with smart home devices among Taiwanese is that their existing home appliances come from various brands and manufacturers around the world, and it is not worthwhile to buy a new fridge or air conditioners for the sole purpose of accommodating a smart home automation system.</p>

<p>Speaking of the future, Ni commented: “It was not easy to build a head-to-toe Taiwanese brand like AIFA here. The journey is tough but we are determined. Because our goal is to be a Taiwan smart home brand people associate with when they think of Taiwan. This is what makes us proud and a path we would like to follow.”</p>

	<a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/vpon.com/" title="vpon.com/"></a>, a Taipei-based startup focusing on big data analytics, announced it has raised a $40 million Series C, one of the largest venture funding rounds of the year so far in Taiwan.</p>

<p>The round is led by Cool Japan Fund, a government-sponsored investment firm that aims to promote cultural exports. Other investors include STIC Investments, a South Korean private equity fund that famously backed Big Hit Entertainment, the company behind K-pop sensation BTS; TripLabs, a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm focusing on the travel and hospitality industry; and Beenos, a Japanese cross-border e-commerce platform listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Founded in 2008, Vpon operates in Taipei, Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, and Bangkok, and helps more than 1,500 clients in both the public and private sectors make marketing decisions based on customer data.</p>

<p>With its proprietary technology in big data analytics and AI, Vpon is widely recognized in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan and has secured long-term partnerships with Japan National Tourism Organization, East and West Japan Railway Companies, Citibank, and Hong Kong Broadband Network, said Victor Wu, Vpon’s founder and CEO.</p>

<p>The Series C <a href="https://thebridge.jp/2020/09/vpon-c-round-pickupnews" title="https://thebridge.jp/2020/09/vpon-c-round-pickupnews">brings Vpon’s total funding raised so far to $60 million</a>. The company raised a $7 million Series A and $10 million Series B in 2011 and 2014, respectively.</p>

<p>With the new capital, Vpon <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59178/vpon-c-round" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59178/vpon-c-round">plans to ramp up R&amp;D efforts and scale up its business in the APAC region</a>, from Taiwan to Japan and South Korea.</p>

<p>In 2019, Cool Japan Fund <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45358" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/45358">has also pumped $10 million into KKday</a>, a travel booking startup based in Taiwan, to help it expand in Japan.</p>

<p>Driving at the speed of 10-20 km/h, these vehicles are being trained to interpret traffic, identify obstacles, and react to a wide variety of scenarios during the trial period.</p>

<p>Approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the project is a collaboration between the two-year-old startup and the city government of Taipei, which <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/28/2003731758" title="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/02/28/2003731758">sees self-driving buses as a solution</a> to the shortage of public vehicle drivers at night.</p>

<p>Turing Drive, with its name a tribute to the British mathematician and AI theorist Alan Turing, develops a proprietary system that <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59156/5g--autodrive" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59156/5g--autodrive">integrates all hardware and software components</a> -- from cameras, lidars, to machine learning models -- into a solution to be deployed in a vehicle. In its self-driving bus, notably, about 70% of the hardware parts the company uses are made in Taiwan.</p>

<p>The company is a partner of Far EasTone, one of the three major telecom companies in Taiwan. The telco, a member of the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), has been actively looking for companies developing Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) solutions to test its 5G network.</p>

<p>In July, Far EasTone, along with Chunghwa Telecom and Taiwan Mobile, <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200707/5g/far-eastone-launches-commercial-5g-network-taiwan" title="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200707/5g/far-eastone-launches-commercial-5g-network-taiwan">launched its commercial 5G services</a> in several metropolitan areas across Taiwan.</p>

<p>With 5G networks ready in Taiwan, the future for 5G-connected self-driving vehicles may not be too far away.</p>

<p>“In the future, all the devices will be able to communicate with each other, and that’s the power of 5G networks,” <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59156/5g--autodrive" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59156/5g--autodrive">said David Shen</a>, CEO of Turing Drive.</p>

<p>Through high-bandwidth and low-latency communications, driverless vehicles will connect to not only each other but also pedestrians, motorists, and infrastructure for sharing data more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<p>“V2X technologies allow vehicles to run truly autonomously,” said Shen. He explained, for instance, the self-driving vehicles today mostly rely on sensors installed along their route to detect pedestrians, but in the world of 5G, they can easily do so by connecting to people’s wearable devices, drastically improving road safety.</p>

<p>Following the current tria project, he said he hopes to deploy V2X communications technology on the same road, which has a dedicated bus lane, as his team’s next step.</p>

Due to the Epidemic, many offline activities have been canceled, Even the world&#39;s most iconic Consumer Electronics Show was forced to cancel. But it transformed into a dedicated exhibition mode. And there have more and more offline campaigns that have altered into online ones. It&#39;s would be the trend in the future. As a result, outreach to media and buyers became very important.

<p>With 20 years of e-commerce experience, PChome is the largest e-commerce group in Taiwan, with over 2 million stock merchandise. Targeting the SEA markets, PChome has launched the PChomeSEA cross-border service, calling for more Taiwan\'s fine products and quality companies recognized by Taiwan Excellence Award and MIT Smile Mark to come on board. Thus gives PChome the most excellent competence in Taiwanese quality merchandise. "Like PChome, our partners in SEA are all local e-commerce enterprises that are leaders in respective markets, and have tremendous competence on local consumers and market situations," said Managing Director Sam Tsai of PChomeSEA. "We will launch the PChomeSEA section on our partner platforms, including <a href="https://tiki.vn/cua-hang/pchome">Tiki</a>, <a href="https://www.qoo10.sg/shop/pchomesea">Qoo10</a>, <a href="https://www.blibli.com/merchant/pchomesea/PCA-7000">Blibli</a>, and <a href="https://www.youbeli.com/pchomesea">Youbeli</a>, to offer a wide range of Taiwanese products at high quality, affordable price, and great value. For SEA consumers to enjoy quality cross-border shopping experience from Taiwan."</p>

<p>"Cooperating with PChomeSEA is the right move to make," said General Manager Sam Too of Singapore\'s Qoo10. "This collaboration will bring us wider and more internationalized choices. Singaporean consumers cannot only find their desired products but also get them faster within a more reasonable time. From the business point of view, this is essentially linking the two markets together. This alliance is an opportunity for the two companies to build a tighter partnership."</p>

<p>"We are very excited about this collaboration. Both companies share the same beliefs regarding customer satisfaction, fast delivery, and product authenticity, offering local Vietnamese consumers a wide range of quality products from Taiwan. I believe this will be more than just a win-win partnership!" pointed out Tran Ngoc Thai Son, founder of Vietnam\'s Tiki.</p>

<p>"Blibli believes the synergy of its cooperation with PChomeSEA will strengthen both companies\' position in the e-commerce market. PChomeSEA can enter the Indonesian e-commerce market that grows over 40% annually via Blibli, and the many quality Taiwanese products will satisfy the needs of Indonesian consumers. We look forward to working with PChomeSEA, and jointly fulfilling our commitment to customer satisfaction," said CCO Robert Luo of Indonesia\'s Blibli.</p>

<p>"We are happy to cooperate with PChomeSEA," said CEO Chua Khai Suan of Malaysia\'s Youbeli. "There are 7 million Chinese-Malaysians, and we also have many Malaysian students coming home after studying abroad in Taiwan. Compared to merchandise from other countries, Malaysian consumers have great confidence in Taiwanese products\' quality and materials."</p>

<p>PChome has proactively explored overseas markets in recent years. The introduction of PChomeSEA cross-border service for the market is not just a new milestone in PChome Online\'s SEA deployment. It\'s also gathering all parties\' strengths to practically resolve many Taiwanese companies\' pain points in the SEA markets. Thus will help Taiwanese products gain greater international exposure and create a mutually beneficial cross-border e-commerce ecosystem in SEA.</p>

A lot of jobs didn&rsquo;t exist 10 years ago, for example, YouTubers, social media influencers, E-sport gamers, and so forth. The technology iterates frequently and leads to an alternative lifestyle. Meanwhile, it also brings challenges to this young generation.</p><p>According to the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2020, the meeting indicated several new trends and warnings for the career of the new generation. Having a sophisticated skill is no longer a golden ticket to ensure a good career. World Economic Forum forecasts that &ldquo;As jobs are transformed by the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we need to reskill over 1 billion people by 2030. In the next two years &ndash; by 2022 &ndash; 42% of core skills required to perform existing jobs are expected to change.&rdquo; Is it scary? We must see our career path with a fresh perspective. The mindset we all need is developing not only high-tech skills, but also specialized interpersonal skills that are in high demand. No matter what generation you are in, it will be more important to have the ability of sales, negotiation, creativity, persuasion, and other people-to-people skills.</p><p>The new technologies may decrease the demand for repetitive, machine-like jobs, but it also free up people to find other people-oriented careers which are hardly replaced by the machine. Governments and leading corporates know the trend and the transformation. What is their plan? They encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is not a new concept, but it is a panacea for every industrial transformation. Entrepreneurs are always seizing the chance to create new technologies when people are complaining, which the technology later take over their jobs. They find a problem and use alternative solution. The government offers incentives and tax reductions for entrepreneurs to support their business. As a result, entrepreneurs and their innovation provide new job opportunities and pushes people to develop new skills. The leading companies encourage innovation and provide resources for startups, then the corporates strategically partner with budding startups or acquire them.</p><p>So, the very first question is: &ldquo;What industry you will dive into?&rdquo;For those you do not know the career path or the business segments you want to enter, there is a nascent trend&ndash;lazy economy and 5G technology.</p><p><br></p><p>First, as you might expect, the lazy economy is characterized by timesaving, labor-saving, hyper-convenient products, and services that meet the needs of the customers. There are two major parts of the lazy economy: F&amp;B service and timesaving service. They meet people&rsquo;s diversified and ever-increasing consumer demands.</p><p><!--[if !vml]--><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/40b/f3c/de0/40bf3cde0c11f7392f6ae62922deedfe05c6232b.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>Gradually, we are ushering in a new level of customer experience and it still has many opportunities for businesses in the lazy economy.</p><p><!--[if !vml]--><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/65b/939/4a2/65b9394a29a26b73cafe672db56622a745ba47b3.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>The scaling of the food delivery platform makes a tremendous demand for delivery workers and drivers. This means more people will engage in this or related industry. People can work for this flexible and task-oriented part-time job, instead of committing to work for a full-time position. According to Statista, the Projected Revenue of Food Delivery Services booms 92% since 2017 and its projected revenue forecast will thrive in the coming two years. Building on that, there are more and more related F&amp;B services that are still developing and changing our consumer behaviors like ingredient-and-recipe meal kit service, personal chef platform, and so forth.</p><p>Besides F&amp;B service providers, diligent entrepreneurs provide new timesaving services to free people from their chores, such as elderly home care, errands, delivery, housekeeping, etc.</p><p>Second, the fifth generation of the network is an often-heard word this year. It is not merely a faster internet, but it changes every aspect of life. Just like your old Nokia cellphone compared to the latest version of the iPhone. 5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds with <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2019/05/13/how-5g-low-latency-improves-your-mobile-experiences">&nbsp;low latency</a>.

Slashies is defined as&ndash;a group of people who have had multiple &ldquo;slashes&rdquo; in their titles and multiple career skills. People don&rsquo;t need to commit to only one job, but they can have diversified career opportunities. For the young generation, they are born this way; nevertheless, for the X or Y generation, it would be a harsh question &ldquo;who you are without your primary job title? &ldquo;</p><p><strong>Legal compliance&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The law and regulation have always fallen behind when technology takes a huge leap.</p><p>Right or wrong has a grey area until the law has been fixed.

For all of us, we need to hustle and have the mentality to absorb new knowledge and skills. Whenever your computer shows the notification to inform you of the recent version of IOS or windows, it is also a chance to remind yourself how long you have ever update yourself to become a better person. It is not telling you to compete with the 24-7 working machine, it is a mindset to keep us awaken from our laziness. Don&rsquo;t stay in your comfort zone for too long, such as having a steady job, traditional thinking method and out-of-date knowledge. This generation is one of the best eras for entrepreneurs to start their business and workers to pursue their ideal career. All thanks to the available information and accessible courses online for pretty much whatever you would like to learn.

Its vision-based biosignal health management system, launched in 2019, detects heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure in real-time through a camera, in contrast to traditional health tools that require human assistance.</p>

<p>In addition to the medical sector, this Taiwan-based startup is \'killing two birds with one stone\' as its contactless solution also serves as a fraud detection tool for the fintech sector.</p>

<h2>Same algorithm, two markets</h2>

<p>Because of Taiwan\'s rapidly aging population, FaceHeart\'s vision-based biosignal health management system is first designed to make the elderly\'s lives easier. The AI system analyzes capillaries\' changes on a user\'s face and collects heart-related data without any physical contact within six seconds.</p>

<p>This technology relieves the discomfort of traditional wearable healthcare devices. It also provides more accurate data as the data collection is done without human interruption. Its reading precision reaches within three beats per minute, similar to the medical standards.</p>

<p>Most cameras in the current market can support the system. Even if the camera\'s resolution is low, it won\'t affect FaceHeart\'s biosignal identification process.</p>

<p>The system also has a recording function that runs 24 hours straight to support home care. Apart from the elderly, this can be used for baby monitoring and patients with particular diseases.</p>

<p>FaceHeart transitioned from a healthcare-only solution to a broader application in 2019. When FaceHeart received a series A funding from MediaTek, who considered the business a potential key player in the healthcare and fintech industries. Soon after the investment, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank announced a partnership with the company to repurpose the algorithm for use as a fraud detection tool. The collaboration and investment have led FaceHeart\'s value to an estimated NT$500 million (US$16 million).</p>

<p>Through heartbeat detection, facial recognition, and emotion detection, FaceHeart\'s software can help the bank inspect users\' identity, prevent identity theft, and identify abnormal behaviors. Furthermore, the bank can deploy it to the Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. The bank can weed out dummy accounts with face recognition.</p>

<h2>The driving force behind Faceheart</h2>

<p>Wong Chun Yin, general manager of FaceHeart, revealed that money-making has never been its main drive. Everyone on the team is motivated by two goals: first, to alleviate the heavy burden of medical staff; and second, to revive the startup scene in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Wong recalled that the startup scene at science parks in Taiwan was very vibrant 20 years ago. However, to this day, only TSMC and MediaTek are recognized by the public and outstanding graduates.</p>

<p>He added that schools should seek partnerships with companies to push good technology forward to the market. The profits should return to the school, hence, building a self-sufficient ecosystem.
	<br>Looking forward, FaceHeart aims to scale up algorithm development, adding two functions to its detection algorithm. It also seeks to partner with camera manufacturers to develop new solid hardware, offering flexibility for consumers and corporates.</p>

<p>In the long term, Faceheart plans to continue investing its technology into medical sectors and to develop a new AI tool that can perform disease risk assessments.</p>

As a child, he received a small wooden piano toy as a gift from his grandmother and fell in love with the instrument immediately. Being from a lower-middle-class family, he did not have the resources to attend piano lessons consistently, so his musical training was often interrupted. &ldquo;I never practiced, I just played and played. I had fun playing,&rdquo; he said. For Musaubach, having fun is the only thing that&rsquo;s important in music.</p><p>He learned music mostly by listening. At the age of 12, a teacher recommended that he join a blues band, whose other members were almost 10 years older. With the band, he was able to perfect his skills in keyboard playing. The band served as a pivot in his adolescent life, providing him with significant emotional support, especially during the time of his parents&rsquo; divorce. After graduating from high school, his father wanted him to study law. However, after trying for four months, he gave up the idea of becoming a lawyer and went back to La Plata to work and study at a college to become a music teacher.</p><p>In 2007, he entered a jazz band competition organized by a Hong Kong agency and won. He spent several years in the Greater China region, working as the band&rsquo;s keyboard player. While touring and performing, he gained recognition and built a reputation for himself. In 2012, he met the renowned Taiwanese producer Michael Tu in Beijing, who invited him and his band to come to Taiwan to produce an album for a Taiwanese artist. Hence, he traveled to Taiwan and fell in love with its people and culture. Even though he had to overcome many obstacles, such as learning the language, getting used to the culture, and making a living, he still decided to settle in Taiwan. According to immigration law, he was required to make an investment and establish a business in Taiwan. Therefore, he founded the music production company 3690 Studio Ltd. in 2013. Due to the language barrier, cultural differences, and unfamiliarity with regulations, Musaubach had to rely on his Taiwanese friends for help. He also got significant assistance and advice from the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association with regard to setting up his company.</p><p><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: 900px;"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/9ab/780/463/9ab7804635e30a761491e7d4e5733a7342fdf0f9.jpg" style="width: 900px;"><span class="fr-inner">Martin Musaubach with kids form free music course</span></span></span></p><h4><strong>Giving back to society</strong></h4><p>As a composer, arranger, performer, and teacher, Musaubach is very active in the music sector. He released his first album, titled <em>3690</em>, in 2013 and his multi-award-winning second album <em>All Kinds of Good</em> in 2017, which attracted a large fan base and had a significant impact. Besides actively collaborating with other artists, he also frequently tours internationally, giving performances and participating in jazz festivals. Several projects in particular were dear to his heart. He recorded the album <em>Kacalisiyan: Canci&oacute;n de la Cuesta</em> together with indigenous tribes, combining South American music with traditional Taiwanese indigenous songs. He also worked with the indigenous singer Aljenljeng Tjaluvie (Abao) and collaborated with P.i.N to form a duo called Indigo Soul Children, releasing the eponymous album <em>Indigo Soul Children</em>.</p><p>After nine years working in Asia, mostly in Mandarin-speaking countries and especially in Taiwan, 2017 marked a turning point for Musaubach. He decided that it was time to give back to the society that had provided him with the freedom and stability to develop as an artist. Therefore, he wrote and established the Twentieth-Century Popular Music Course and started teaching the three-month-long music course to the public for free at Taipei Artist Village Cafe. Additionally, he also gave free jazz piano lessons to students in need. &ldquo;I do not play and make music to become rich. I only take what is needed to take care of my family; the rest I gladly give back to society,&rdquo; stated Musaubach.</p><p>Musaubach believes that education is the key to change the world, and in his own way, he is doing his part. &ldquo;I am publishing a new, free book very soon, which I have been working on for almost three years and teaches students the importance of collaboration and how to make and produce popular music from scratch,&rdquo; said Musaubach. For him, the act of delivering education free of charge can help make the world a better place and support local communities. Looking ahead, he intends to continue providing free education, collaborate with indie artists and bands, and promote local and indigenous music.</p>', '5f7/eae/917/5f7eae91777c6241298856.jpg', 1, '2020-10-08 06:24:41', '2024-09-01 21:55:17', null);

	<p>iCHEF, a mobile restaurant point of sale (POS) provider based in Taiwan, raised US$5 million (NT$150 million) last week in a funding round led by JAFCO Taiwan through a private equity fund called JAFCO Taiwan I Venture Capital. China Development Financial and Darwin Venture also participated in the round. iCHEF said it is planning an initial public offering (IPO).</p>In response to the slight drop in funding compared to 2016 when it garnered US$5.6 million (NT$162 million) in a Series A funding round led by AppWork, Ken Cheng, co-founder of iCHEF, explained: "iCHEF\'s operation has become self-sufficient. We saw a growth opportunity, and we want to act upon it. The funding goal (US$5 million) is set after careful calculation."

	<p>iCHEF\'s app consolidates all the major functions required for operating a restaurant such as table-management, orders and takeaways, promotions, and discounts, and the option of accepting various payment methods. When an order is made, it simultaneously goes to the printers of the corresponding workstations in a kitchen. The app also creates detailed reports about the performance of restaurants\' promotions and ordering trends. All data is automatically backed up to the cloud.</p>

	<p>iCHEF intends to use the fund to expand its research and development team and create more strategic partnerships with international platforms. Additionally, the company aims to focus on supporting small to middle-sized restaurants and strengthen food ordering websites and systems, customer service, the overall efficiency, and the function of customer relationship management.</p>

	<p>Commenting on their investment, VC firm JAFCO Asia said, "We hope our investment can support iCHEF to continue improving its user experience. We also hope to get them ready for potential mergers and acquisitions in the future and help them gain a strong foothold in the food and beverages tech industry."</p>

	<p>In 2019, iCHEF partnered with Facebook to integrate Facebook\'s reward points collection model into its existing POS system. Customers do not need to download new apps or bring paper loyalty cards everywhere to collect restaurants\' dining points. They can give the cashier their phone number or scan the QR code on their receipts to save points on Facebook. For small restaurants, waiters can save time from dealing with customers on explaining how reward points work and focus on their main service, while owners can spend less time analyzing their reward points strategy.</p>

	<p>With the rise of takeaway deliveries, the company also collaborated with UberEats, Lalamove, and Line to connect these food delivery platforms to the iCHEF app. Instead of going to every food delivery app to update the menu or cancel an order, restaurant managers can go to the iCHEF app to review all menu items and manage all customers\' orders from the dine-in restaurant and external platforms at once.</p>

	<p>"From day one, iCHEF aims to grow with small local restaurants. We hope restaurant owners can put their time and energy on their food, and we take care of administrative tasks with our technology," Cheng said.</p>

	<p>Looking forward, Cheng and iCHEF\'s co-founder Benjamin Wu are eyeing for an IPO.</p>

	<p>"I want to change the talent scene in Taiwan. The majority of outstanding local SaaS talents leave Taiwan to boost their career. I hope iCHEF can ultimately change this and retain the top talents by offering them a space to thrive," said Benjamin Wu, co-founder of iCHEF.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Cheng hopes that iCHEF can become a brand people yearn for and a company that reminds people of "anything is possible."</p>

	<p>iCHEF, founded in 2012, currently has more than 8,000 restaurants across Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore. In 2019, it had generated more than NT$2 billion in revenue.</p>

Aside from the summit this year, we believe more and more industries will seize the chance to integrate new technology and grow fast via digital transformation due to the impact of COVID-19. IN addition, the ongoing development of 5G Internet and lockdown limitations with border control will urge more international exhibitions and summits to transform into online interaction. To adapt to the new lifestyle in the post-pandemic era, online virtual interactive technology enables people to interact and exchange information simultaneously, breaking the physical limits of distance and reducing physical exposure or crowd gathering.</p><p>Reference:<br><a href="http://ican-iaps.com.tw/news/ins.php?index_m_id=5&index_id=139">http://ican-iaps.com.tw/news/ins.php?index_m_id=5&amp;index_id=139</a><br><a href="https://cis.riseaccel.com/">https://cis.riseaccel.com/</a></p><p><br></p>', '5f8/ff7/615/5f8ff76151146875875731.jpg', 1, '2020-10-21 08:55:26', '2024-09-01 21:54:40', null);

<p>"We are not satisfied with (traditional ways of) ad optimization and media buying...Our core purpose is to help build the trust between our clients and their customers through marketing technologies," KooData CEO Jason Sun said in the statement, citing increasing fragmentation of social media and rising costs of digital advertising.</p>

<p>To scale up its business, KooData continues searching for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) targets that can bring greater synergy to its operations, according to the statement. The firm has expanded its service footprint to Thailand and Malaysia in recent years.</p>

<p>KooData raised $2.5M in its Series A funding led by China Development Financial Holding Corporation at the end of 2018. The money was planned for overseas expansion, product development and talent acquisition.</p>

<h3>New opportunities in times of pandemic</h3>

<p>Despite the economic uncertainty brought by the pandemic, KooData gave a relatively optimistic outlook for the coming year, given the flexible nature of the digital marketing industry.</p>

<p>Customers are more inclined to purchase online as they intend to adjust to a new normal in the post-pandemic era. The change in consumer behavior creates an opportunity for Koodata, whose primary services include live streaming e-commerce solutions.</p>

<p>Koodata expects sales to reach the benchmark of NTD1 billion ($34.8 million) next year (2021), company officials <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46894" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/46894">told</a> Bnext.
	<br>Cumulative revenue in the first two quarters of this year increased by 25% on an annual basis, according to Koodata.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015, KooData helps its corporate clients with advertising tools designed for social media platforms such as Line, Facebook, and Youtube. It has also expanded its business to live streaming marketing after acquiring Fiiser, a cloud and live streaming service provider.</p>

<p>The startup has provided services for nearly 30,000 clients. Most of them are small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses, company data shows.</p>

<h3>Footing in Fukuoka</h3>

<p>Based in Fukuoka, Japan, Gogolook\'s first wholly-owned overseas subsidiary will become operational soon this month (November), according to Kuo.</p>

<p>"The reason why we chose Fukuoka (as its headquarter for the Japanese market) is that the local government is actively seeking solutions for financial frauds," Kuo <a href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47008" title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47008">said in an interview with Meet</a> .</p>

<p>Kuo said that the decision was also due to Fukuoka\'s important position in the Japanese market - it is one of the National Strategic Special Zones in the country. The municipal government of Fukuoka provides incentives for foreign startups who aim to tap into the local market, he added.</p>

<p>The primary business strategy is to earn consumer trust through collaborations with local governments, Kuo said, citing high entry barriers in Japan. Given this, Gogolook would focus on the Kyushu Region and expand its services to other parts of the country later, he noted.</p>

<p>Gogolook has been working with the government of Fukuoka for its three-phase Proof of Concept (POC) project. It already completed the first phase by launching advanced Whoscall services and conducting a survey of users\' responses, according to the company.</p>

<p>Looking forward, Gogolook aims to continue optimizing its products in response to the emergence of new scams on social media and communication apps. "Maybe after three years, Whoscall will have very different solutions (for Japanese customers)," Kuo said.</p>

<h3>Tapping opportunities in the FinTech sector</h3>

<p>The fresh capital from WIN Semiconductors will also be used to develop financial technology (FinTech) products, based on the concept of inclusive finance, according to Gogolook.</p>

<p>In September, Gogolook announced its first FinTech product Roo, a platform for users to compare personal credit loans.</p>

<p>Through cooperation with six banks, the startup extends the application to its database and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to the product to avoid financial fraud. The six collaborative banks include Cathay, KGI, HSBC Taiwan, Citibank Taiwan, Standard Chartered and O-Bank, according to Roo\'s website.</p>

<p>Gogolook said the product could help users, especially those who lack sufficient knowledge, identify their best loan options and alternatives. The platform, which has been in trial operation since March, also provides online person-to-person consulting services.</p>

<p>The startup aims to create "an ecosystem based on trust" through innovative and user-centric designs, Kuo said <a href="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59329/roo.cash" title="https://www.bnext.com.tw/article/59329/roo.cash">in another interview</a>.</p>

<p>Whoscall currently has over 1.6 billion entries in its database of number information, the largest of its kind in East Asia. The app has accumulated over 80 million downloads worldwide since its launch, according to the startup\'s Chinese-language website.</p>

<p>The latest cash injection came after Gogolook last year (2019) secured an undisclosed sum in investment from Cathay Sustainable Private Equity Fund in return for a 30 percent stake.</p>

	<br>On November 16, the final workshop held under the APEC Women-Led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative was hosted in Taipei. More than 60 participants from the APEC region participated in this grand event, contributing to Asia-Pacific Start-Up connection and development through this virtual workshop. Despite of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, this event contributed to the empowerment of women entrepreneurs in the field of access to capital and market.
	<br>This online workshop hosted by the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA), Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)involved stakeholders from various backgrounds including, policy makers, women-led start-ups and SMEs from the APEC economies to share their opinions. It has shown the world that SMEs from the APEC economics stayed strong to the goal of enhancing the capabilities of women entrepreneurs and will not be defeated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Strengthening Female entrepreneurship in APEC</strong>
	<br>The workshop began with opening remarks delivered by Pei-Ti Hu, Deputy Director General of SMEA, MOEA. "Even in the 21st century, gender inequality is still an issue that we need to pay attention to. It is time each government making progress on building up a women friendly entrepreneurial environment in their respective economics." said Ms. Pei-Ti Hu.
	<br>"We recognize the obstacles that female entrepreneurs may have. Under this circumstance, we aim at empowering women to overcome the challenges and make efforts on female entrepreneurship with resources they need when developing their businesses."&nbsp;continued Ms. Hu, as she emphasized the significance of women economic empowerment and the essential goal of the workshop.</p>

<p><strong>APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative</strong>
	<br>Whereas economic growth and better targeted social policies have contributed to shortening gender gaps in educational attainment, significant disparities remain in women entrepreneurship in the APEC region. As the APEC Women and the Economy Dashboard 2017 demonstrated: "Access to Credit" measurement of women\'s right and de facto access to bank loans takes the value of zero, when women have the same rights to access credit and bank loans as men; 0.5, when women only have the right to access some kinds of credit. This shows that gender inequality in entrepreneurship is still an issue that needs to be overcome.
	<br>The APEC Women-led Start-Up Accelerator Initiative is proposed by Chinese Taipei, to address the topic of access to finance and market opportunities. This event aims to enhance female entrepreneurship and strengthening business competitiveness of women-led startups by providing them with trainings and mentorship. In the past months, Chinese Taipei held the first workshop under this project with Indonesia in August, and a second workshop in October with Malaysia. Both events attracted great attention and active participation from the APEC economies. This event in Taipei was the final workshop under this initiative. Through these events, Chinese Taipei will continue to cooperate with partner economies to promote the capacities of women entrepreneurs and help create an enabling environment toward inclusive growth.</p>

Alex Ma, founder of Daione, figured out how he could increase customers from other countries after the number of Chinese tourists shrank in 2015. He then started an online platform to match influencers with businesses. In the Thai market, he discovered 90% of customers would be affected by the Internet while 86% of Thai consumers would change their decisions based on articles or videos made by influencers on social media. With the focus of cross-border marketing, Daione uses high-frequency automation to match internet celebrities. Their clients include companies from several high-end industries, such as physical tourism stores and international leisure industry, etc. When facing international clients or corporate partners, Alex would conduct market research on their target customers in order to understand consumption pattern and expenditure in different areas. He then come up with various ideas for influencers to partner with his clients. On the other hand, he also helps Thai clients target Taiwanese consumers. In Taiwan, internet celebrities bring a big impact on marketing. Companies utilize content to attract consumers first by providing product info via internet celebrities. It then trigger purchase depending on consumers&rsquo; trust in the influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/1c2/364/22e/1c236422e8c20d87a993aa3beff3ebe78f79a60e.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>In the following session, the business deputy director of STARTBOARD Edison Hsueh, explained that STARTBOARD is a one-stop startup service that provides startups with services on visas, taxes, legal service, governmental resources, office space, investment reminders, etc. He also shared tips on starting a business abroad as well as domestically. In the past three years, with the characteristic of civil diplomacy organization, STARTBOARD has assisted over 30 ASEAN startups to land in Taiwan. When ASEAN startups intend to enter Taiwan, they would intuitively think of STARTBOARD by word of mouth. Edison also talked about the latest trend in the Thai market. Thailand is the first country that operates 5G service in ASEAN -- even earlier than Taiwan!! Thai telecommunication companies combined 5G with AI and robots. They built up a reputation and caught attention from international media. This shows that Thai market actually has more potential and technology capability than we used to think. However, finding potential clients, creating service beyond cultural understanding, and integrating different technologies would be the key for startups to penetrate a new market.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/f28/d24/666/f28d24666c7f32790af367497191acad32991c04.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>After the sharing session, the participants brought up several questions in the FAQ session. How do you select the first target country for cross-border business? How do you modify operating models for the tourism industry based on the pandemic? According to Alex, statistics is a critical tool. Companies can check the country&rsquo;s GDP in proportion to certain industries. For example, Daione targeted Thailand mainly because tourism revenue accounts for around 14% of its GDP. For industries related to tourism, it goes up to around 22%. Aside from business transformation and modification, Edison said adjusting mindset during the pandemic can lead to new business models. Meanwhile, this is a prime moment for global industries to transform digitally, which can be a compelling business opportunity for Taiwanese startups to create new services.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/e87/f6e/e29/e87f6ee29d84288348af17d48cef60fb4745b3bc.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/656/2cb/a34/6562cba349ff4b380d5de2b7956c30f40535d36f.png" style="width: 100%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>For the following one-on-one private professional consultations with investors, we invited Manager Peng from DIT Startup, Partner Weng from Smart Capital, and Manager Liu from United Daily News Group.

At Meet Global Salon 2020, angel investor Susan Wu and Backend Captial’s general partner Dave Fontenot, who both have extensive experience in Silicon Valley, shared their thoughts on what it means to be a hacker and their views on Taiwan’s startup scene.</p>

<p>Wu defined a hacker as anybody who is constantly thinking outside the rules of the system to create a new system. He or she can be a technical hacker, a social system hacker, or a system hacker.</p>

<p>“For example, Donald Trump is a brilliant social engineer. Even though his intentions are nefarious, he’s really good at hacking popular culture to whatever he wants to be. And there are system hackers such as the entire Black Lives Matter movement. It is a showcase of system hackers dismantling power from those who have traditionally held power and distributing power to people who have not had power in the past,” Wu said.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of different ways to think about hacking. When I invest or work with entrepreneurs, I look for some hacker energy,” she added.</p>

<p>Fontenot agreed that the most common perception of a hacker, which refers to those writing codes or breaking into a computer system, is a very narrow view.</p>

<p>“Hacker is more of a mindset,” he said.</p>

<p>To be a good hacker, Wu said one has to understand the rules of the game very well in order to bend the rules. If a hacker can’t understand that, he or she cannot be a good one.</p>

<p>She noticed that the education system in Taiwan reinforces obedience and compliance, and she proposed encouraging a cultural shift in the city in which people play by the rules and master the rules so they can create their own new rules.</p>

<p>Commenting on the startup scene in Taiwan, Fortenot said it is very different from that in the Silicon Valley and not necessarily in a good way.</p>

<p>“Susan and I were taking a walk individually before the conference. I noticed that not many founders tried to engage me in any ways. In Silicon Valley, when I see hackers at a conference,they’re pushing every limit of the rules at the conference to get the attention of the people walking by,” he said.</p>

<p>Wu echoed his sentiment.</p>

<p>“Every opportunity is a conversion point. Every single interaction is a conversation point. You should be mastering and manipulating those conversion points as much as you can,” she said.</p>

<p>“One of the important things startups in Taiwan can do is start pitching to the Daves and me.”</p>

<p>Another thing Fontenot and Wu noticed about Taiwan’s startup scene is that hackers focus too much on their technology feature.</p>

<p>“What really strikes me about the startup ecosystem here is that there’s a lack of the ability of productization. There are a lot of descriptions and features of the technology. The startups may have really fantastic technology here but I wouldn’t be able to tell based on the stories that these startups are telling about their products,” Wu said.</p>

<p>She cited a compelling story as key to success. She elaborated a good pitch should answer these questions: How are you going to change the future of the world? Why would I get excited about this either as a customer or an investor? How are you going to change my life as a human being living in the world? How are you going to change the world economy and ecosystem?</p>

<p>“We’re ultimately human beings. As Donald Trump has shown and as all these other populist movements have shown, we want to be moved emotionally by everything, whether it is science or technology or products. We want to be moved and touched emotionally,” she explained.</p>

<p>Additionally, Fontenot said startups in Taiwan should focus more on their users.</p>

<p>“The top founders in Silicon Valley are so focused on their users. They are constantly telling me who are going to use their product or if some people have already been using their product, how it changed their lives, or how it will change my life as a user,” he said.</p>

<p>Looking back, Wu said now is a great time to become a hacker or an investor.</p>

<p>“When I first started in Silicon Valley, there weren’t many role models. The companies are very traditional white-shoe VC firms with a fairly conservative way of doing things. It was only with the rise of micro VCs and with the incubators and the very powerful individual angel investors, then the culture started to change,” she reflected.</p>

<p>“There are many different paths for succeeding in Silicon Valley today that didn\'t exist previously.”</p>

<p>She continued saying that 2020 is a great year for female hackers as well. Female hackers can be the most effective hackers because nobody is going to expect them as a hacker.</p>

Numbers Protocol solves this by providing tools to help users create tamper-proof records of media content.</p>

<p>Numbers Protocol, the only company in Taiwan certified by both OpenChain 2.0 and MyData Operator, was recently selected by Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) as one of the 100 startups from Taiwan to be showcased at CES 2021.</p>

<p>“Addressing the ‘seeing is no longer believing’ dilemma is the top motivation and priority of Numbers. We developed an image traceability framework that includes Capture, Seal, and Trace,” says Tammy Yang, Founder and Co-CEO of Numbers Protocol.</p>

<p>The company built three products within its traceability framework. The Numbers Capture app records the birth information of an item of media content at the point of creation and generates a certificate with a unique signature.</p>

<p>Numbers Seal API uses blockchain technology to seal that item’s birth information and change-logs with immutable records. Numbers Trace API and dashboard service tracks the asset content footprint at every level from creation to archive, and plays an integral role in reducing the effort required for verification. All media content created using Numbers Capture comes with a unique certification ID. When this content is shared, viewers can scan a QR code to review and verify.</p>

<h2>Capture digital images like a normal app with security and traceability features</h2>

<p>Users operate Capture like any other mobile camera application. When a picture is taken, the app will automatically record the time, location, photographer, and other metadata to create a unique birth certificate for image traceability.</p>

<p>An additional feature of the Capture app is the PostCapture function, which allows users to generate unique digital image “postcards”. These postcards are digital assets that users have full ownership of, ensured by the blockchain. These assets can be shared and, like any postcard, the ownership may be effectively transferred. We hope that Capture App’s PostCapture feature can help to reinstate uniqueness and value to original photographic works.</p>

<h2>Transparency and open-source</h2>

<p>Numbers Protocol has always worked to protect the privacy of users while they use their phones. For instance, the company developed an app that helps track COVID-related symptoms of patients while preventing cloud collection.</p>

<p>As one of the only three MyData operators in Asia, Numbers helps users own their own data and regain control of their personal data. Most of the products created by Numbers Protocol are open-sourced, bringing additional transparency to users.</p>

<h2>A team that shines</h2>

<p>Numbers Protocol is led by Tammy Yang who earned her PhD in Physics from the University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology. Yang earned her bachelor\'s degree in Physics from National Taiwan University. Prior to founding Numbers, Yang was a co-founder and deep learning researcher at DT42, a technology company focused on AI &amp; deep learning, where she researched algorithms to make deep learning models lighter and faster. She was also a data scientist for Viscovery, an artificial intelligence company focused on providing Vision AI solutions using the latest computer vision and deep learning technologies.</p>

Taiwan&#39;s ASUS brand &quot;ROG&quot; has also become the only official partner of India for the first designated equipment.

In eSports, the players tend to cherish their career as professional or amateur video game players which motivates them to actively participate in tournaments. Therefore, a high level of recognition in multi-player videogames is indeed essential for eSports industry. Looking into the growth of the online game players in India, the industry predicts a positive shift. Many industries have been affected due to COVID19. However, the lockdown became a thriving factor for the eSports industry. Housebound people are driving to accept a new model of engagement through eSports. And around 35% higher usage has been noticed in multi-player modes in online gaming. Many eSports platforms have reported double-digit growth in the user base during the lockdown. For example, Paytm First Games has reported an almost 200% increase. This new addition to the sports industry is well greeted since 2019.

It is crucial to receive proper authorization or license from the appropriate personnel. Make sure that your intellect is properly shielded with IP protection in an adequate form of IP such as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, etc. Otherwise, IP infringement can cost a fortune.</p><p>In India, the Public Gambling Act is the most influential law in eSports industry. Since the Act is a State Subject, therefore, the regulations may vary from state to state. However, Indian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) prohibit any kind of investment or collaboration for foreigners in lottery, gambling, betting field, and even in technology. Therefore, it would be wise to understand the regulations surrounding your investment. The Information Technology Act further regulates the electronic transmission of gambling information too.</p><p>To maintain morality, decency, and to avoid provocative contents, this industry is regulated by many other laws such as The Code of Advertising Standards Council of India to control the content of the advertisement in the eSports industry, The Information Technology Rules which control the transmission of information, and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, etc.</p><p>Apart from legality, negotiating power has become the foremost concern in this industry.

<p><strong>Raising entrepreneurs as baby sharks, not poodles</strong></p>

<p>To become a good investor, Cinnie Huang from ITIC said one has to be able to bring in all the resources for the founders and also allow them to fail.</p>

	<figcaption>The first panel in Woman in Venture event was about "How to Not Miss Out on the Next Billion Dollar Opportunity?" and the speakers were Cinnie Huang from ITIC, Tanna Yang from CTBC, Lisa Lo from CID Group and Lucia Liao from GadgeTek (Acer Group)</figcaption>Anchor Taiwan</figure>

<p>She cited that her previous experience as a product manager had helped her quickly spot all the potential pitfalls founders are going to make. While speed and delivery are fundamental in the startup world, she said an investor ought to give founders space to test out their hypothesis and learn from both the success and failure.</p>

<p>Tanna Yang from CTBC group, who was also a product manager before, agreed the work experience had become an advantage for her to grow her investment portfolio.</p>

<p>“As investors, we need to ask the right questions, for example, whether the founder is the right person to lead the team,” she said. Lisa Lo, partner of CID group, added timing is also important, in addition to giving the right advice.</p>

<p>Three panelists listed gender differences and cultural shock as some of the challenges they had encountered.</p>

<p>“Being a venture capitalist, we need to see every challenge as a positivity,” Lo said.</p>

<p>“We should be doing what is right, instead of doing what is expected. Sometimes we may try to partition ourselves into a female or non-female thing to do but we shouldn’t do that. Only flash drives need partitioning,” Huang said.</p>

<p>Yang said they are always looking for founders that are already thinking through all the journeys in the upcoming five to ten years.</p>

<p>“Our first questions usually are: Why do you want our money? Why do you want to be our partner?” she said.</p>

<p>Huang advised startups to look for an investor that resonates with them.
	<br>“Looking for an investor should be like looking for your future spouse. You are not looking for someone that is the richest or has the biggest muscles. It should be about whether he understands your vision, whether you can communicate with him and trust him, and whether he has the integrity you value,” Huang said.</p>

<p><strong>Common mistake and what should an investor do</strong>
	<br>Sunshene Tsou from Taiwania Capital, Angela Liu from Cherubic Ventures, and Cathy Hwang from Zumaya Equity, further elaborated the essence of an investor.</p>
<figure><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 900w" title="" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">

<p>To score a highly sought-after deal, Tsou said flaunting capital is not the key to winning. Alternatively, investors need to show the startup their “true value.” Hwang added the role of venture capital or private equity is similar to a salesperson’s, so investors need to think about their value-added in order to stand out from their competitors.</p>

<p>Liu said the next thing to do after making an investment is to help the founders find the next investors and secure their Series B fundings.</p>

<p>“My experience is that most of the funding processes are painful. There are a lot of back and forth introductions, inquiries, and rejections. What we can do is to leverage all of our networks to help them secure any kind of investors that might be suitable for their portfolio. Of course, luck is also an important factor in all investment, “ Liu said.</p>

<p>“You have to trust your founders. Once you bet on them, you have to trust them and help them cope with all the troubles. You have to try all the means you can get to help them survive the most painful part.”</p>

<p>One of the common mistakes founders or CEOs make is the lack of focus, as cited by Liu and Hwang, and it is an investor’s job to help them bring back the focus.</p>

<p>“Founders tend to be dreamers and pathbreakers. They are very creative. It is easy for them to be distracted by other things, for example, attending useless events or PR sessions. As an investor, it is essential to drag them back to the track. We need to make sure they are always pushing their products and delivering the next version of the product because only users can give them feedback, which decides whether the company will succeed.</p>

<p>Tsou added that many founders or CEOs try to do everything by themselves. They are smart but they don’t know how to delegate responsibilities to the people they hiring. Investors should be supportive and remind founders if such a situation occurs.</p>

<p>Hwang pointed out another form of ‘lack of focus’ as the incompetence of identifying their customer base.</p>

<p>“There aren’t too many levers for startups to survive. Either they grow revenue or cut expenses. Founders who are successful at securing venture funding typically are those who know who their customers are exactly and have a concrete plan to go after them,” Hwang said.</p>

<p>At a time of uncertainties like the present, Laura Huang, associate professor at Harvard Business School reflected that innovation should be coming out of it but most people sort of follow what other people are doing.</p>

<p>“We always put pressure on ourselves to seize the uncertainties as it is an opportunity. When it comes to uncertainties, a lot of us go for average. However, being comfortable with uncomfortable is how you deal with uncertainties and complexity. It is a superpower,” she said.</p>

<p>“We often heard in forums or conferences, ‘What do we want to do with our lives?’ The question should really be: Who do we want to become in our lives? I am comfortable with risk and complexity so I know I should really lean into it. My investment strategy is to go big or go home,” Susan Wu, angel investor who had grown up in an ever changing environment, said.</p>

	<figcaption>The first panel in Woman in Venture event was about "How to Not Miss Out on the Next Billion Dollar Opportunity?" and the speakers were Cinnie Huang from ITIC, Tanna Yang from CTBC, Lisa Lo from CID Group and Lucia Liao from GadgeTek (Acer Group)</figcaption>Anchor Taiwan</figure>

<p>She cited that her previous experience as a product manager had helped her quickly spot all the potential pitfalls founders are going to make. While speed and delivery are fundamental in the startup world, she said an investor ought to give founders space to test out their hypothesis and learn from both the success and failure.</p>

<p>Tanna Yang from CTBC group, who was also a product manager before, agreed the work experience had become an advantage for her to grow her investment portfolio.</p>

<p>“As investors, we need to ask the right questions, for example, whether the founder is the right person to lead the team,” she said. Lisa Lo, partner of CID group, added timing is also important, in addition to giving the right advice.</p>

<p>Three panelists listed gender differences and cultural shock as some of the challenges they had encountered.</p>

<p>“Being a venture capitalist, we need to see every challenge as a positivity,” Lo said.</p>

<p>“We should be doing what is right, instead of doing what is expected. Sometimes we may try to partition ourselves into a female or non-female thing to do but we shouldn’t do that. Only flash drives need partitioning,” Huang said.</p>

<p>Yang said they are always looking for founders that are already thinking through all the journeys in the upcoming five to ten years.</p>

<p>“Our first questions usually are: Why do you want our money? Why do you want to be our partner?” she said.</p>

<p>Huang advised startups to look for an investor that resonates with them.
	<br>“Looking for an investor should be like looking for your future spouse. You are not looking for someone that is the richest or has the biggest muscles. It should be about whether he understands your vision, whether you can communicate with him and trust him, and whether he has the integrity you value,” Huang said.</p>

<p><strong>Common mistake and what should an investor do</strong>
	<br>Sunshene Tsou from Taiwania Capital, Angela Liu from Cherubic Ventures, and Cathy Hwang from Zumaya Equity, further elaborated the essence of an investor.</p>
<figure><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1610934554742.jpeg" srcset="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 400w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 600w,https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2020-12/img-1609240293-53248@900.jpg 900w" title="" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;" data-result="success">

<p>To score a highly sought-after deal, Tsou said flaunting capital is not the key to winning. Alternatively, investors need to show the startup their “true value.” Hwang added the role of venture capital or private equity is similar to a salesperson’s, so investors need to think about their value-added in order to stand out from their competitors.</p>

<p>Liu said the next thing to do after making an investment is to help the founders find the next investors and secure their Series B fundings.</p>

<p>“My experience is that most of the funding processes are painful. There are a lot of back and forth introductions, inquiries, and rejections. What we can do is to leverage all of our networks to help them secure any kind of investors that might be suitable for their portfolio. Of course, luck is also an important factor in all investment, “ Liu said.</p>

<p>“You have to trust your founders. Once you bet on them, you have to trust them and help them cope with all the troubles. You have to try all the means you can get to help them survive the most painful part.”</p>

<p>One of the common mistakes founders or CEOs make is the lack of focus, as cited by Liu and Hwang, and it is an investor’s job to help them bring back the focus.</p>

<p>“Founders tend to be dreamers and pathbreakers. They are very creative. It is easy for them to be distracted by other things, for example, attending useless events or PR sessions. As an investor, it is essential to drag them back to the track. We need to make sure they are always pushing their products and delivering the next version of the product because only users can give them feedback, which decides whether the company will succeed.</p>

<p>Tsou added that many founders or CEOs try to do everything by themselves. They are smart but they don’t know how to delegate responsibilities to the people they hiring. Investors should be supportive and remind founders if such a situation occurs.</p>

<p>Hwang pointed out another form of ‘lack of focus’ as the incompetence of identifying their customer base.</p>

<p>“There aren’t too many levers for startups to survive. Either they grow revenue or cut expenses. Founders who are successful at securing venture funding typically are those who know who their customers are exactly and have a concrete plan to go after them,” Hwang said.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to embrace uncertainties and write your own success</strong></p>

	<figcaption>The last panel was "How to Find Your Edge and Turn Adversity into Advantage," featuring the talks from Susan Wu, an angel investor, and Laura Huang, the author of Edge and Harvard Business School professor.</figcaption>Anchor Taiwan</figure>

<p>At a time of uncertainties like the present, Laura Huang, associate professor at Harvard Business School reflected that innovation should be coming out of it but most people sort of follow what other people are doing.</p>

<p>“We always put pressure on ourselves to seize the uncertainties as it is an opportunity. When it comes to uncertainties, a lot of us go for average. However, being comfortable with uncomfortable is how you deal with uncertainties and complexity. It is a superpower,” she said.</p>

<p>“We often heard in forums or conferences, ‘What do we want to do with our lives?’ The question should really be: Who do we want to become in our lives? I am comfortable with risk and complexity so I know I should really lean into it. My investment strategy is to go big or go home,” Susan Wu, angel investor who had grown up in an ever changing environment, said.</p>

<p>Wu reminded investors that there are so many ways to succeed as an investor in the startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>She observed that successful venture capital stories and people profiles circulating online and offline, for example, The Forbes Midas List, are homogenous. These content, curated by a rich and powerful male-dominated social circle which she called “power bros”, always aims to tell readers what venture capital success should look like. From her experience, she knows successful venture capitalists who stay out of the spotlight and do not follow the narratives set by the clique.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of different ways we can be writing our own stories. You can be a successful investor without having to be part of the power bros,” she said.</p>

	<p>HuKui Bio, a Medtech consulting company founded by John Hsuan, a veteran of semiconductor industry, recently raised a Series C round investment of about $5.5 million to start doing business in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Founded in 2013, HuKui Bio’s initial mission was to help Taiwanese Medical Devices Manufacturers to comply with the local regulation for selling products to China market. Nowadays, HuKui has expanded its services to clinical trials, prototype development, OEM/ODM, and distribution channel. They are aiming to become a one-stop service platform for Asia and the world.</p>

<p>The $5.5 million raise led by Chaico Investment Corporation brings the cash influx and the U.S. and European strategy partners to accelerate HuKui setting foot into the Western market.</p>

<p>To strengthen the U.S. market shares, HuKui recruited Dr. IC Jan, now serve as mentor at 500 Startups, and SkyDeck, as their chief strategy officer. "Everyone knows that people started working remotely in 2020. The doctor starts to take care of patients remotely too. Combined with cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things, the biomedicine industry will be the next fastest-growing sector," Dr. IC Jan said that excitedly.</p>

<h2>Covid-19 brings big opportunities to HuKui Bio</h2>

<p>“On one hand, the US-China trade war since 2019 and Covid-19 pandemic bring lots of challenges to our business. On the other hand, it also brings us the chance to upgrading and transformation,” HuKui Bio CEO Jia-Yong Guo said.</p>

<p>Due to the US-China trade war and Covid-19, it became hard to export medical devices from China to the U.S. As a result, it severely affects HuKui’s business. Luckily, the needs for testing kits also come with the pandemic. With profound experience in applying for the medical device manufacturing license, HuKui quickly became the selling agent for U.S. diagnostic kits manufacturer Co-Dianostics Inc.</p>

<p>With strong testing needs in Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America, HuKui started providing testing kits to these areas and gain tremendous success. In the end, HuKui moved against the tide and experienced 77% YoY growth sales.</p>

<p>HuKui\'s core team members and original shareholders include experts from biomedicine, information technology, and semiconductor arena. “With strong domain knowledge from technology and biomedicine areas, HuKui will keep cooperating with partners and concentrate on building the one-stop platform that combines license application, CDMO, matching resources, and marketing consulting,” Jia-Yong Guo said.</p>

People go to Silicon Valley to change the world with their business plan, on the other hand, venture capitalists swarm into Silicon Valley for finding the next unicorn startups.</p><p>But now, the situation is slightly changing; the number of unicorn startups outside the US has been growing bigger and bigger. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1096928/number-of-global-unicorns-by-country/">According to the data from the statista</a>, the number of unicorn startups in the US in January 2020 is 265, but the country with the second most, China, already accumulated 204 unicorn startups. If we combine China, UK, India, Germany, and South Korea, the number of unicorns would be 273, which tops the US.</p><p>Obviously, in these years, more VC dollars are invested outside the U.S. and there are more unicorns being created outside the U.S. &quot;The next stage of venture capital going global happens to pass through where 500 Startups is the strongest,&quot; Tony Wang said.</p><p>500 Startups co-founder and CEO, Christine Tsai, decided to bet on startups around the globe instead of only focusing on Silicon Valley at a very early time. &quot;It was contrarian to invest outside Silicon Valley back 11 years ago when 500 Startups was founded, but her vision paid off. Today, 500 has a very huge global network. It&#39;s very hard to be replicated by others, and this is also the main reason I wanted to join 500 Startups,&quot; Tony Wang said.</p><p><a href="https://500.co/blog/welcome-tony-wang/">According to Christine Tsai&#39;s blog post</a>, in 2019 the startups they invested outside the US already accounted for 49% of their portfolio. Now 500 Startups&#39; portfolio has expanded to 77 countries, and 19 startups they invested in had become unicorn, including Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab, online course platform Udemy, and design platform Canva.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/3a5/2c7/26b/3a52c726bbcc9bc858ad7ef36217940defc393da.jpg" alt="500Startups_profolio.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><div data-aid="47323">500 Starups invested in unicorns including Southeast Asia ride-hailing giant Grab, online course platform Udemy, and design platform Canva. / Photograph : 500Startups<h2>Targeting helps Taiwan software startups go to the global market</h2><p>500 Startups has been good at digging investment opportunities around the world, and this time they spotted the potential of software ecosystem in Taiwan. &quot;Taiwan has very strong technical talents in software industry. People usually think Taiwan is good at manufacturing electronics, and sure Taiwan already has a very solid hardware ecosystem, but actually we can not ignore the software talents here anymore,&quot; Tony Wang mentioned.</p><p>Tony Wang said confidently, &quot;People might question whether this is too early for investing software in Taiwan. The software ecosystem here has not mature yet. But as venture capitalists, we always need to foresee the future, we always need to grab the chance to be ahead others.&rdquo;</p><p>There are already lots of VC from Silicon Valley that have started their accelerator program here many years ago. What different resource can 500 Startups bring to Taiwan? Tony Wang mentioned again that 500 Startups has been building global network for over 11 years, and that&#39;s hard to be copied.

After the two-month-long intensive interview and selection process, the MOEA organized the opening ceremony for the first echelon in northern Taiwan, to respond to the support of Microsoft Taiwan, and in central Taiwan, for Victor Taichung Machinery Works, on December 14, 2020. The opening ceremony was brimming with youthful enthusiasm and vitality. Minister of Science and Technology and Deputy Convener of the Board of Science and Technology (BOST) of the Executive Yuan Wu Tsung-Tsong, Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan Audrey Tang, and MOEA Chief Secretary Chen Yi-Ling showed their support by joining the opening ceremony together from the two venues through live streaming. Their participation demonstrates that the government cares about and has high expectations for T Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Digital transformation has become a significant challenge for this century, on which the COVID-19 pandemic has effected a critical impact. The T Ambassador Program was created by the Executive Yuan\'s Office of Science and Technology to devise directions for talent cultivation and development, with the aim of quickening the pace of digital transformation among industries in the cloud era. The Program trains new graduates as seed talent for industrial digital transformation to help industry position itself for digital transformation, develop innovative business models, and enhance industrial competitiveness. The SMEA aims to facilitate the practice of digital transformation among companies through this Program. In addition to the interview and selection process, young applicants were required to pass the aptitude test and career competency assessment. After which, they were coached by mentors who have experience in international business management in devising and planning the direction and tasks of digital transformation for businesses. Moreover, the participants took part in a two-week intensive training course in northern, central, southern, and eastern Taiwan, as well as a 24-week hands-on practice of industrial digital transformation. Through training, these young participants built momentum for digital transformation, integrated industrial knowledge and skills into practical cases, and also closely interacted with companies\' core decision-makers of digital transformation during the training. So far, more than 2,000 applicants have applied for posts as T Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Today is the joint opening ceremony of the first echelon, a total of 120 participants who passed the interview process. In support of the central themes of digital transformation and local training and dissemination, the opening ceremony was held in northern and central Taiwan and was live streamed. The trainees were also invited to visit the two supporting enterprises of the Program- Microsoft Taiwan and Victor Taichung. As the training kicked off, the trainees had a chance to thoroughly experience what a company needs to embark on a digital transformation journey and also learn about potential applications from best practice cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the support from businesses, MOST Minister and BOST Deputy Convener of the Executive Yuan Wu Tsung-Tsong and MOEA Chief Secretary Chen Yi-Lin joined the opening ceremony in northern Taiwan, while Audrey Tang, Minister without Portfolio of the Executive Yuan, was a highlight in her role as "Audrey Cat"&nbsp;at the venue in central Taiwan. In the opening remarks, Minister Wu, Minister without Portfolio Tang, and Chief Secretary Chen all encouraged T Ambassadors to contribute what they have learned and to help develop industrial digital transformation. After the opening ceremony, the three officials amiably joined the group photo session with participants. Due to the precautions for COVID-19, the event organizer thoughtfully prepared masks printed with "Audrey Cat"&nbsp;images for attendees, making the opening ceremony even more special.</p>

<p>The T Ambassador Program targets university and college students who are soon to graduate (those who graduate before June 2021 and have to submit their diplomas before completion of training) or people who graduated in three years\' time and are in-between jobs (those who graduated after January 1, 2017). Recruitment for the Program will continue until December 27, 2020. Young applicants looking to enhance their digital transformation skills are welcome to apply for the Program.&nbsp;</p>

Coaches, venues, and sports services gain exposure through the platform while consumers find various types of resources in sports. The team said more than 80% of people exercise regularly in Taiwan, yet they still have two pain points. The first one is the lack of diversity in sports which the public can get access to. The truth is that there are many more interesting sports awaiting to be discovered by the public. The second issue is that many athletes can&#39;t live by coaching after they retire. If no one guides them during their transition, most athletes are left to choose a job that has nothing to do with their sports.

	<p>William Bao Bean, the general partner at the most active global venture capital firm SOSV, spotted Taiwan as the best incubator for serving the next 4 billion mobile internet users from around the world. William set up MOX here in Taiwan, a mobile-only accelerator, to connect all the mobile companies together.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Technology analyst who knows the Asian market the best</h2>

<p>William Bao Bean forged an indissoluble bond with Taiwan as early as his graduation year. As soon as he graduated from college in the US, he came to Taiwan to work as a researcher at the American Institute In Taiwan (AIT), which is the de facto embassy of the US in Taiwan and owned by the US Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>With Taiwan\'s semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries starting to boom at that time, the experience to work in Taiwan not only consolidated William\'s understanding of the technology industry but also intrigued his interest in the Asian technology market. He foresaw that the Asian market can not be neglected in the future, and planted a seed in his heart to bring him back to Asia after leaving several years later.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-04/img-1617939852-19475.jpg" alt="William Bao Bean_General Partner at SOSV" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>25 years ago, William work in Taiwan as a tech analyst. The experience eventually leads William to bring the accelerator back to Taiwan. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p>

<p>Two years later, William went back to Wall Street to work as a tech researcher at investment bank Bear Stearns, which, at that time, had the top-ranked PC &amp; hardware analysis in the world. With his understanding of Taiwanese and Asian technology industries, William kept discovering potential tech companies from Asia for the western investors. He built a reputation among institutional investors for his familiarity with the Asian technology market and attracted SoftBank Group to hire him for investing in this market.</p>

<h2>Helped several Asian companies\' IPO and spotted the internet booming there.</h2>

<p>Between 2002 to 2014, William kept honing his vision by making one after another successful investment in Asia. He spotted the potential of Alibaba, which later became an e-commerce giant in China. He spent two years introducing Alibaba to western investors. Furthermore, he arranged for former President Bill Clinton to come to Hangzhou for a feast with Jack Ma. Eventually, he helped Alibaba achieve the IPO successfully.</p>

<p>Not only did he invest in China, William\'s investment portfolio was across the whole Asian market. He invested in Peacesoft - a Vietnam eCommerce and payment platform backed by eBay, GMobi - a mobile platform from Taiwan, and Massive Impact - an Israel mobile advertising startup later acquired by GMobi.</p>

<p>Because of his achievements in investing, he was ranked No.1 stock picker in technology, media, and telecom in Hong Kong/China by Forbes, and ranked top 3 All-Asia analyst for Technology/Software by Institutional Investor Magazine Asia.</p>

<p>Through one after another investment across Asia, William felt that the internet was definitely taking off there and he should get on the train. At first, he planned to bring Google\'s business model directly to here, which means building an advertisement platform that lets internet startups promote their business. But, his knowledge of Asia told him that simply copying Google\'s business model did not fit in this market, he needed to reshape it.</p>

<p>William talks about building a revenue sharing based internet ecosystem in Taiwan. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p>

<p>Instead of building a Google-like advertisement platform, William thought of building an advertisement platform that is based on revenue sharing. Startups would not pay for posting ads, but only pay when the ads bring back revenue.</p>

<h2>MOX, a mobile only accelerator but also a revenue-sharing advertisement ecosystem</h2>

<p>In 2014, the opportunity for building his idea came to William. SOSV, a multi-stage venture capital firm with US$855 million under management and more than 1000 companies in their portfolio, invited William to join as a general partner and target the growing mobile internet populations in Asia to set up an accelerator. Lots of countries popped up from his mind, but after careful consideration, he decided Taiwan is the best suitable place to be a hub for the potential 4 billion mobile internet users.</p>

<p>"I could set the accelerator anywhere, but I think Taiwan has an unfair advantage compared to other countries, and that is engineering talents. People might say China has lots of mobile internet users, why not set up in China? Well, China\' engineers are too expensive, and for Southeast Asia, there do not have enough talents on the technical side," William said.</p>

<p>In 2015, William set up <a href="https://mobileonlyx.com/">MOX</a>, which means a mobile-only accelerator. William planned to include two kinds of startups in MOX. One is the startup\'s mobile application is sticky but may not make a lot of money, and the other is the startup\'s mobile application is making a lot of money but is not sticky.</p>

<p>With these two kinds of startups in the MOX, William would let startups cross-promote for each other. The sticky applications can help promote other profitable apps, once the profitable apps make more money from promotions, it is reasonable to share some revenue back to the sticky apps.</p>

<p>Each batch in MOX is 6 months, and they had held their 10th demo day this year. Once the mobile startups join MOX, they will get a US$100K-$120k investment, and the opportunity guided by over 350 mentors from MOX, but most importantly, the startups can be promoted to the MOX ecosystem that has over 100 million smartphone users.</p>

<p>For the first three and half years, startups in MOX, which include 15 apps, only got 6 million active users. But then, MOX’s active users grow from 6 million to 50 million in the next half year. Furthermore, it grows from 50 million to 102 million to date.</p>

<p>"It\'s been a tough ride at first. But later the growing numbers prove we are in the right direction. Our goal for the next 5 years is to grow the active users to over 1 billion across the world and be the top ten global internet ecosystems," said William.</p>

<p>During these five years, MOX attracts numerous startups from around the world to come to Taiwan, and help seven startups relocate to Taiwan including <a href="https://www.italki.com/">italki</a> and <a href="https://snapask.com/">snapask</a>, which strengthening the interaction between Taiwan and international.</p>

<p>"From my point of view, the key for Taiwanese startups to grow big is to sell outside Taiwan, and that\'s what MOX can help with. I am interested in having more and more Taiwanese startups join us," Willaim said.</p>

Besides having a high population of migrant workers, there is also plenty of Indonesian students studying in Taiwan. To encourage people who are interested in the Indonesian market to have a better understanding of the startup environment, STARTBOARD held the Indonesia Theme night on 26th March 2021. The event was a success with many distinguished guests attending the event, including Budi Santoso (Representative of Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia), Ali Fauzi (Director of the Investment Department), Yudha Tri Utama (Analyst of Investment Department), SUNSINO VENTURE GROUP, and Indonesian Students&rsquo; Association of National Taiwan University. STARTBOARD has also invited few Indonesian entrepreneurs in Taiwan who have in-depth knowledge of the Indonesian market. Huang Hsien-Cheng, the co-founder of Alson Retail and Tuku online, shared his startup experience about E-commerce as an entrepreneur. Secondly, Wen Fu-Shun, General Manager of Leyun in Indonesia, introduced the process of bringing Taiwanese brands crossing the border to Indonesia and the future trends in cloud service. Last but not least, Wu Chun-Hsing, the founder of ISheEra, shared his experience in selling Taiwanese brands to Indonesia and the differences between both markets.</p><p><strong>Prospects of Indonesia Market and Opportunities for Taiwanese Companies</strong><strong><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/3d9/7e0/378/3d97e03782ee397fbd49f1a1aa2c9d5d989f58c4.png" style="width: 600px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong></p><p>&ldquo;There is rapid economic growth and rising opportunities in the Indonesian market.

In addition, the government has prompted a new policy, which allows foreign enterprises more flexibility in entering the Indonesian market. Ali Fauzi, the Director of the Investment Department, Taipei Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta, Indonesia, added: &ldquo; The current policies not only subsidies the foreign companies, but also eased the restrictions of industry categories that are allowed to trade in Indonesia. In the past, there were about 350 industry categories restricted. Now, 300 of these industries are allowed to make investments or management, leaving only 46 industries left with limitations.&rdquo;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/b5d/ff8/9b5/b5dff89b56fb5c1841affa9a4e7658f03e3b5c2a.png" style="width: 600px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p><strong>Venturing into E-commerce isn&rsquo;t that hard.

Huang Hsien-Cheng came to Taiwan after realizing the importance of learning Chinese. However, throughout his experience from school and his part-time job, he decided to start Alson Retail, the first Indonesian online shop in Taiwan. Alson Retail sells necessities to Indonesians in Taiwan and has expanded rapidly through precision marketing via social media. Huang Hsien-Cheng is now building his second e-commerce platform Tuku Online, which is going to sell products from his hometown. &ldquo;Start small. Dig deep. Think Big.

Nowadays, influencer marketing and sponsored post is no longer something new or fresh in the Taiwanese market, however, the marketing strategy still works among Indonesian customers.</p><p>In the meantime, he pointed out the mistakes these companies often make. Most of them have great products but they don&rsquo;t understand the differences in consumer behavior within the local market. Therefore, he suggested: &ldquo;If you want to enter the Indonesian market, you need a partner who fully understands the Indonesian consumers.&rdquo; Taiwan is generally not informative in the Indonesian market, finding a reliable local partner can avoid big mishaps.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/da7/fe4/d50/da7fe4d500e0ae7598b6aeeb2726982ea40df920.png" style="width: 600px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p><p>At the end of the event, founder of STARTBOARD, Uniform Lin mentioned: &ldquo;The population of southeast Asians in Taiwan has grown rapidly these years.

They host an online exhibition called &quot;<a href="https://www.computextaipei.com.tw/en/exhibitor/show-area-grid/Garage+%2046%20Must-See%20Startups/list.html">Garage+ 46 Must-See</a>&quot; inside Computex through the incubator Garage+ to showcase the startups.</p><p>inPhocal, selected as one of the &quot;Garage+ 46 Must-See&quot;, is a Netherland startup that developed breakthrough laser technology to accelerate the efficiency of the marking industry.</p><h2>Marking industry&#39;s wasting problem</h2><p>People consume a tremendous amount of beverages around the world every year, and it is normal to see beverage cans and bottles everywhere. Especially in summer, it becomes part of life that when people get thirsty, they just grab a bottle of Coke or Pepsi and drink it. According to the data, there are 2.7 billion cans and bottles produced per day in the world. Although governments have enacted laws to ask people to recycle empty bottles and cans, wasting inkjet printing to mark texts on the bottles is another huge problem that everyone ignores.</p><p>Traditionally, in the bottles and cans production line, factories use inkjet printing instead of laser to mark the texts because inkjet is much faster than laser. Current laser marking systems cannot work as quickly as inkjet to mark the same sized surfaces, and the one reason is that laser systems have a short focus. But using inkjet printing comes at a price, Inkjet printing equipment needs constant cleaning and maintenance, furthermore, marking the texts would need a high cost of consumables inks: 160 million liters of ink for inkjet inside production lines yearly, which is eco-unfriendly.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/444/2a5/e18/4442a5e18982eb17e64f96e8c84409bc0649f66f.jpg" alt="inPhocal" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><p data-aid="47391">Inkjet needs constant cleaning and maintenance. There are 160 million liters of ink used for inkjet inside production lines yearly. / Photograph : inPhocal</p><h2>Cutting edge laser system to replace inkjet</h2><p>For tackling the problem, inPhocal, combined the optical technology developed by Europe leading research institute with inPhocal&#39;s unique lens, designed an advanced laser system that can create a long focal length laser beam. Taking a magnifier as an example, some children like to burn leaves with a magnifier, and the leaves would only be burned when the magnifier&#39;s focal point aligned with the surface of leaves. Unlike standard laser beams that lose their focus quickly, sometimes within 1mm, this advanced laser system can maintain a focused spot at a distance 400 times longer than conventional systems.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c47/4b2/9b2/c474b29b2d4dcef7da55bb53db5b0eb3f98440d8.jpg" alt="inphocal" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"><p data-aid="47391">inPhocal&#39;s laser system can maintain a focused spot at a distance 400 times longer than conventional systems, and can have a wider operating surface. / Photograph : inPhocal</p><div data-aid="47391"><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vecnKcLB6YU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="fr-draggable"></iframe></span><p>&quot;Our technology was based on a solid research. Our team developed an original idea around the technology and developed a first prototype based on the technology principle. We want to build this technology to cause a revolution in the field of laser-based products as no other technology is capable of going beyond the limits that are set by the current technology,&quot; said CTO of inPhocal Dr. Martijn Boerkamp, who is a physicist with 15 years of experience in optical technology and applications.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/a21/5ac/364/a215ac364e90777acc71b2f7645c3c35692e98d2.jpg" alt="inphocal" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">inPhocal&#39;s laser system. / Photograph: inPhocal<p><br>Instead of selling the laser system, inPhocal comes up with a unique business model, which is Laser As A Service (LAAS). Customers have no need to invest a huge amount of money to buy the laser equipment, but they can rent the equipment with monthly fees. &quot;We know that companies that use inkjet in their production lines have monthly costs, related to the use of ink. Our LAAS model will allow companies to maintain their monthly costs the same as with inkjet, but they can switch to a cleaner, more sustainable technology in their production lines,&quot; said Martijn Boerkamp.</p><h2>Seeking partners in Taiwan</h2><p>Now inPhocal&#39;s laser technology is expanding beyond marking on the bottles. Actually, with the high speed of laser beam and higher precision, inPhocal wants to target every industry that applies lasers, and this is also the reason why they join Garage+ Startup Global Program. Hearing of Taiwan&#39;s strong technology industry, inPhocal wants to bridge with big techs like TSMC, Logitech, and Foxconn, etc, through Garage+.</p><p>inPhocal already in talks with Logitech as part of the Garage+ to discuss collaboration for the use of the laser technology.&quot;We will continue to develop unique technology to revolutionize the complete market that uses lasers. Our next goal is to implement our technology into production lines and to start sales. We are already in talks with potential customers and supply chain partners. For the semiconductor technology we are looking for companies to express their interest, such as TSMC and Foxconn.&quot; said Martijn Boerkamp.</p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe width="540" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mO-yxsaiBI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="fr-draggable"></iframe></span><h2>Might be one of solutions for chip storage</h2><p>Because of strong demands from electronics, digital products, and electric cars this year, there is a chip storage crisis around the globe. Chip manufacturers like TSMC and UMC are currently expanding the production capacity, as they were asked to by governments around the world. inPhocal&#39;s laser technology might be able to help chip manufacturers to increase the capacity. &quot;Our laser beam can be focussed to a smaller spot than conventional lasers can, which means We have a more precise cutting technology, so our laser can let manufacturers put more chips on one wafer and cut it properly, which can increase the efficiency of production and help the chip shortage problem,&quot; said Martijn Boerkamp.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47391">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47391</a></p></div></main></div></div>', '60b/ecd/479/60becd4794c19419254874.jpg', 1, '2021-06-08 01:55:26', '2024-09-01 21:39:05', null);

As traditional POS terminals could only handle basic orderings, they developed the entire brand new POS system on their own, aiming to optimize the workflow between servers and chefs, which then became iCHEF, the most awarded POS design ever, including the 2016 iF Design Golden Award.</p><p>Starting to develop its overseas market in 2016, iCHEF has now owned the largest share of the POS system in Singapore, accounting for 30-40% of the market as it does domestically.</p><p>On top of that, while the food and beverage(F&amp;B) sector, which has been hit hard by COVID-19 restrictions in Singapore, experienced a 26% decline in sales in 2020, iCHEF merchant sales however rose by 8%.</p><p>Following the success it has gained, iCHEF took another step forward recently as it integrated with the greatest unicorn in Southeast Asia. Grab, which has lately clinched a record-breaking SPAC merger, securing a $40 billion equity value, evolved from a ride-hailing app operator to offer various services such as GrabFood.</p><p>In the past, when receiving orders from GrabFood, restaurant staff had to key them into their iCHEF POS manually, which made taking orders from the food delivery platform a time-consuming and error-prone task. With the integration of the two platforms, GrabFood orders now appear on iCHEF menu automatically and thus are sent to the kitchens directly, saving up to 40 mins during peak hours.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/9aa/275/76b/9aa27576bb594ac8787dcf707f2e67d467b9e16f.jpg" alt="iChef.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>The integration of iCHEF and GrabFood highly streamline the online food ordering and delivery process. / Photograph: iChef</p><p>Furthermore, there are over 30 e-payment methods in Singapore, and thus many restaurants have adopted Xero, a New-Zealand based online accounting platform for small businesses, to help with their bookkeeping.</p><p>With the integration of financial data from the iCHEF into Xero, automated accounting is now available for restaurant owners on iCHEF. As Xero takes care of the accounting of the food cost, expenses, commissions, and the payment received from banks, orders from different channels with different payment methods are now automatically dealt with by iCHEF and Xero.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/cdb/179/dd6/cdb179dd610ecc0009d315d50a83fba2d5aeeeb1.jpg" alt="iCHEF.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>iCHEF users can now have their finances automatically managed, regardless of order channels and payment methods. / Photograph: iCHEF</p><p>iCHEF users can now have their finances automatically managed, regardless of order channels and payment methods.</p><p>In fact, not only Grab and Xero, iCHEF has long been collaborating with Facebook, UberEats, and LINE in Taiwan. In March 2021, Google has also become one of its partners.</p><p>The partnership deal with Google introduced Google My Business (GMB) service into iCHEF POS system. That is, instead of applying GMB on their own in the standard way, iCHEF now enables their users to directly open and have their shops licensed on Google Map, cutting the original 14 days of waiting to 3 days only.</p><p>&quot;We aim to become the POS that integrates the most platforms, and the openness of Taiwan&#39;s ecosystem allows us to do so,&quot; said Ken Chen, the co-founder of iCHEF. Since there are no monopoly platforms in Taiwan, iCHEF is able to cooperate with as many companies as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, iCHEF is no longer just a POS system, it has now advanced its business by positioning itself as a platform of platforms for F&amp;B that benefits three sides of the restaurant business.</p><p>For restaurant owners, it digitalizes the marketing and financial management; for restaurant staff, it makes orders and kitchen management more efficient. As for customers, iCHEF makes mobile ordering and membership management easier.</p><p>&ldquo;The menu, the table orderings, and the CRM data are all synchronized on iCHEF, it&#39;s an omni-channel service,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve always tried to make opening a restaurant a better business.&quot;</p><p>Online ordering demand and food delivery service have both grown faster than ever in recent years, especially due to COVID-19. &quot;The pandemic has challenged the status-quo of the F&amp;B industry, and this causes larger F&amp;B companies to adopt iCHEF as their POS,&quot; he added.</p><p>Consequently, instead of developing new markets, the team is now focusing more on their technology development, gaining its footing in the countries it has developed and eyeing an IPO.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47399">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47399</a></p>', '60d/03d/9ca/60d03d9cacdae959409953.jpg', 1, '2021-06-21 07:21:58', '2024-09-01 21:38:00', null);

All three of them double as serial entrepreneurs and startup advisors. Together, they founded MVP Fastlane, an accelerator equipping startups with resources in need, including capital, product development guidance, and global talent recruitment.</p><p>Having worked in Silicon Valley, the trio considered an innovative mindset and a complete startup ecosystem two critical success factors for aspiring startups. &quot;Considering a stream of tech talents, it&#39;s strange how not one Taiwan-based software company could make it to NASDAQ,&quot; said Jack Wu. Having good connections with Taiwan talents and American startups, MVP Fastlane looks forward to bridging demand and supply, cultivating Taiwan as a powerful startup talent trove.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/100/9c0/47b/1009c047bae3df96920283cfff26a37a26e845b8.jpg" alt="Silicon Valley" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Silicon Valley is vibrant with new ideas.

Tiwen Lin possesses a master&#39;s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA, with 8+ years of experience in product development. Jack Wu is a former Intel employee with over 30 successful startup projects and worldwide tech talent connections. Nick Wu is an investor in the Pasadena Angel Club, specializing in technical due diligence for startups in consumer hardware, semiconductor, and medical sectors. Abundant resources and exceptional expertise has made MVP oversubscribed in 2020.

MVP Fastlane gets first-hand insights on whether the product is marketable by working closely with the startup team. Participating with startups also helps them better picture their financial health, which serves as a determinant of whether to continue investing. Possessing insider information meant higher efficiency and credibility compared to other venture funds.</p><p>For start-ups in the MVP Fastlane ecosystem, they receive three facets of support: pre-seed investment, product design and development, and global talent recruitment. After due diligence is carried out, start-ups receive about 20 to 50 thousand USD investment from MVP Fastlane. The story does not end here. Start-ups receive follow-ups and further collaborate on product development with MVP Fastlane. Close collaboration fosters trust between investors and start-ups, also allowing for timely troubleshooting.</p><p>MVP Fastlane&rsquo;s profit model involves R&amp;D fees, which are incurred when they guide product development and design. Start-ups they target are those with high potential and high growth in the sectors of enterprise AI software, the future of retails, and smart IoT.</p><p>MVP Fastlane&rsquo;s investment performs significantly better under a more precise and insight-based selection mechanism. Their investment acumen won recognition with world-class investors, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Plug N Play Ventures, Mucker Capital.</p><p><br></p><h2>Success story: market success in under 4 months</h2><p>Finli, one of MVP Fastlane&rsquo;s clients, is a consumer finance start-up based in the US. With MVP&rsquo;s product development guidance, Finli successfully delivered its product in 4 months and was later accepted into TechStar accelerator, acquiring USD 2.5 million in their seed round.</p><p>The product development process is no picnic. Jack said in our interview, &quot;When helping Finli design and deliver its product, we had to pivot 4 times. The team stuck with us, and from there, we see the difference between Taiwanese and American entrepreneurs.&quot;</p><p>For start-ups, the ever-changing product development process could be a troublesome business. However, with product development experts and experienced marketers from MVP Fastlane, start-ups are equipped with all the resources they need to achieve market success.

Headhunter companies often allocate capacity according to recruitment size; as a result, startups usually receive less attention. With MVP Fastlane&#39;s global talent pool dedicated to finding tech talents for startups, startups can access top-tier talents. MVP Fastlane has its all-star headhunter team and HR specialists, helping entrepreneurs build a top-tier team and manage all the HR complexity such as payrolls and benefits quickly.</p><p>MVP Fastlane focuses on finding tech talents for companies, from junior software engineers to management positions. Currently, services are offered mainly for start-ups in the MVP Fastlane incubation ecosystem. As its headhunting business picks up pace, MVP Fastlane is anticipating expanding its capacity of talent recruitment, making a move into other US-based companies that wish to recruit Taiwan&rsquo;s exceptional engineers. What&rsquo;s more, as remote work becomes the trend for major companies in light of the pandemic, cross-border talent matching is met with increasing demand.</p><p>&ldquo;Taiwan&#39;s talent is exceptional. We are the few headhunters that could bridge demand from US-based start-ups and the talent supply from Taiwan,&quot; said Jack. Managing cross-border resources, MVP Fastlane has 20 full-time employees and has expanded to Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Taipei, and Hsinchu.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407</a></p>', '60f/4de/4de/60f4de4de6fce159543752.png', 1, '2021-07-19 02:20:03', '2024-09-01 21:37:23', null);

She established Anchor Taiwan to show the world what Taiwan has to offer.</p></blockquote><p>Silicon Valley, home of countless world-changing startups like Facebook, Tesla, Airbnb, and Uber, is a sacred place many Taiwanese startups look up to. Taiwan has always regarded Silicon Valley as a model for its technology, trends, and investment philosophy. Many Taiwanese people also consider Silicon Valley as an attractive workplace.</p><p>As software became mainstream, many Taiwanese tech talent went to Silicon Valley to unleash their potential. The tech talent from Taiwan have made undeniable contributions to the booming of Silicon Valley.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/f9e/050/6af/f9e0506af75e97238728f7c7bfe9cacbe6faba0c.jpg" alt="Silicon Valley" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Taiwan has always regarded Silicon Valley as a model for its technology, trends, and investment philosophy. Many Taiwanese people also consider Silicon Valley as an attractive workplace. / Photograph: Joseph Sohm via shutterstock</p><p>&ldquo;But what if we can attract globe professionals to come to Taiwan, instead of sending our talent away?&rdquo; said Elisa Chiu, founder of Anchor Taiwan.</p><p>&quot;For a long time, Taiwan didn&#39;t have much visibility in the global innovation ecosystem, because Taiwan hasn&rsquo;t focused much on building itself as a brand,&quot; said Elisa. As a result, she founded Anchor Taiwan, with the mission to advocate her hometown to the world. In the beginning, Anchor Taiwan curated entrepreneurial residency programs and innovation sprints, attracting foreign talent, especially startup founders and investors from Silicon Valley to Taiwan for business advancements, softlanding and market immersion.</p><p>As an ecosystem builder, Anchor Taiwan connects foreign and local stakeholders one event, one meeting, one program at a time. Through hundreds of forums, roundtables and networking sessions, it creates a unique bridge between Taiwan and the world. With a background in finance, in 2019 Elisa set up Anchor Venture Partners with early investments into founders and General Partners that have existing or potential connections with Taiwan. An example is Nick Budeen, <a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47416">who founded software startup Phase and set up an engineering team here</a>.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c09/e25/db5/c09e25db5a6401fe22c8950f22ecb00c1e2264a0.jpg" alt="Anchor Taiwan 打造台灣新創生態系" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Through hundreds of forums, roundtable and networking sessions, Anchor Taiwan creates a unique bridge between Taiwan and the world. / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p><h2>From Wall Street madness to startup enthusiasm</h2><p>Before starting her Taipei-San Francisco cross-border life, Elisa worked at one of the biggest global hedge funds in Hong Kong, managing over US$1 billion in assets. While her career seemed impressive and life seemed glamorous, Elisa felt like she was not moving towards her calling. In 2013, she resigned from her job and departed to look for her life purpose. Through numerous explorations, even with a failed attempt to be a war zone photojournalist, she finally found her &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; when she arrived in Silicon Valley.</p><p>&quot;Many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have clear drives and goals bigger than themselves,&quot; said Elisa. That makes Silicon Valley a unique place for startup communities. Passion begets passion, and the sparks in people&rsquo;s eyes lit up the fire in Elisa. &ldquo;Perhaps startup is my destiny,&rdquo; said Elisa.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/9aa/fa2/0dc/9aafa20dcdd3b689873e5586131d04b042fdb3bf.jpg" alt="Anchor Taiwan" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Silicon Valley is a unique place for startup communities. Passion begets passion, and the sparks in people&rsquo;s eyes lit up the fire in Elisa. / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p><p>At first, Elisa thought of leading Asian startups to the US. However, it&rsquo;s a crowded space with many existing platforms and government programs already in place. She also quickly realized that startups from Asia still face a lot of systemic challenges that need further ecosystem cultivation to tackle. She wondered if there is a win-win scenario for international startups and talent to get what they need in Taiwan, while injecting fresh perspectives and tech professionals for Taiwan&rsquo;s ecosystem. The belief is that cross-border collaboration can start from either side of the ocean, and the hope is that in the long term everyone is better off.</p><h2>Try to advocate Taiwan to the world from day one</h2><p>Getting corporates, governments and startups to go to Silicon Valley doesn&rsquo;t take much persuasion, but it&rsquo;s a very different story the other way around, especially when the destination is Taiwan, relatively unknown when it comes to the innovation ecosystem. &quot;Nobody was optimistic about Anchor Taiwan back then. When you are lucky, you meet people who at least know the difference between Taiwan and Thailand. But Taiwan is generally not on the map when it comes to a hub for investing or building your startups.&quot; said Elisa, &quot;I believe it is on us to find the right way to showcase Taiwan for the world.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe width="540" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbpDlttN5CU?enablejsapi=1&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219="true" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_25="true" class="fr-draggable"></iframe></span></p><p>Therefore, Anchor Taiwan spent a lot of time over the years building databases, collecting industry insights, cultivating exclusive access, and honing its business acumen for real value-add that Taiwan has to offer. It hosted the first cohort in June 2017, and has come a long way as a well-recognized platform.</p><h2>Main pillars of Anchor Taiwan</h2><p>&quot;Cross-border, entrepreneurship and mission-driven are my personal life pillars,&rdquo; said Elisa. &ldquo;And that set the foundation of Anchor Taiwan.&rdquo;</p><p>A believer for multidisciplinary and cross-industry collaborations, Anchor Taiwan&rsquo;s programs last from a few days to one month before COVID. It also regularly curates events with topics ranging from the future of mobility, blockchain, 5G, corporate venturing, circular economy and more. Anchor Taiwan&rsquo;s highly selected cohort members are often industry leaders, and they frequently share their expertise with the local community to &ldquo;bring the world to Taiwan&rdquo; through their residency or visits in town.</p><h2>Some signature event series</h2><h3>Meet the Anchor</h3><p>Connecting people who are interested in startups - founders, investors, mentors and more. This event is limited to 30 attendees each time, with facilitated round circle introductions and free-flow networking.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/3b0/9b5/920/3b09b5920f289f680a712e5e5600050a2aeb6798.jpg" alt="Meet in Anchor" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Meet in Anchor / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p><h3>Women in venture</h3><p>The only community for female investors in Taiwan with roundtables for industry sharing, experience exchange and career development.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/552/cb5/7e4/552cb57e4b70b0e79a277912974bf2d4f62c0e3b.jpg" alt="Anchor Taiwan 舉辦 Women in Venture女性區塊鏈社群活動" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Gather the female investors in Taiwan and share investing information and news through a round table. / Photograph : Anchor Taiwan</p><h3>Corporate Venturing</h3><p>Building the ecosystem for corporate executives focusing on venture capital (CVC) and innovation for more cross-border and cross-industry collaborations.</p><h2>Silicon Valley and Taiwan - different &ldquo;terroir,&rdquo; after all</h2><p>With years of observation, Elisa also noticed the special role the government plays in the Taiwanese startup ecosystem. For example, the Employment Gold Card program has attracted a lot of international talent to Taiwan, especially during COVID. While some programs work and some don&rsquo;t, Elisa believes that the government has good intentions, and &ldquo;Compared with what we had in 2017, the ecosystem is definitely a lot more international nowadays!&rdquo;</p><p>In the long run, too much &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; and subsidies from the governments may not be healthy. &ldquo;Entrepreneurs are supposed to hustle with grit,&rdquo; said Elisa. It would be an area worth monitoring for the best development of our ecosystem.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47409">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47409</a></p>', '612/594/a5d/612594a5d9981749175460.jpg', 1, '2021-08-25 00:58:02', '2024-09-01 21:35:43', null);

Besides the nationals, new immigrants with valid ARCs and APRC holders can get “Quintuple stimulus vouchers”. About 140,000 new immigrants and 16,000 APRC holders are eligible for “Quintuple stimulus vouchers, the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said.</p>

<p>On May 19, 2021, Taiwan raised the national COVID alert to Level 3. Tightened epidemic prevention restrictions hit many domestic demand-oriented industries. A second round of amendments to the Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens were subsequently promulgated on May 31, which boosted the special budget cap for the COVID-19 response to NT$840 billion (US$30.3 billion). Taiwan\'s COVID-19 relief special budget was increased a third time in June by NT$259.5 billion (US$9.4 billion) to fund a "relief package 4.0" aimed at minimizing the impact on people and businesses. Now that the domestic transmission of the disease has been brought under stable control, the government has initiated a fourth increase to the special budget, adding NT$160 billion (US$5.8 billion) to fund "quintuple stimulus vouchers," which will help encourage spending and boost domestic demand.</p>

<p><strong>Key measures of the relief package 4.0</strong></p>

<p><strong>■ Accelerating relief for individuals</strong>: In addition to administering aid in accordance with last year\'s standards, a subsidy is available for families with students enrolled in elementary school and below, as well as disabled students in junior and senior high school and the first three years of five-year junior colleges. Living allowances are also going out to children, young people, the elderly and the disabled in low to middle-low income households. Excluding those above a certain income, agricultural and fisheries workers, the self-employed, and workers without fixed employers also receive living allowances.</p>

<p>Also eligible for payments are workers without labor insurance, casual and part-time employees, full-time employees whose wages were impacted between May and July, workers aged 65 or older, and middle-aged to elderly workers who collect social insurance pension payments, small shopkeepers, self-employed and freelance art and culture workers, taxi and tour bus drivers, tour guides and tour group leaders, foreign permanent residents, short-term course instructors, and hourly workers.</p>

<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Strengthening support for industry</strong>: Depending on circumstances, one-time operating subsidies and one-time employee payments are available to new target industries including commercial services, tourism, transportation, driving instruction, educational enterprises, the sports industry and affected personnel, arts and culture businesses, and care services. As for social welfare organizations, transportation businesses and bus companies that received money last year, additional assistance may be available this year as conditions dictate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, subsidies to help cover basic operating costs for airport commercial services and facilities companies have been raised to 40 percent. Passenger rental car businesses are eligible for new one-year subsidies to cover disease prevention materials for short-term rental cars, while subsidies for the tour industry covering the cancellation of tour group trips have been extended. A flexible approach to the classification of startup enterprises for relief purposes has also been adopted, among other measures.</p>

<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Increasing the amount of bank loans available</strong>: COVID relief loans are administered through a number of programs, including worker relief loans, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) relief loans (including health care and educational business), state-owned bank relief loans, agricultural relief loans, and central bank SME relief loans. Under relief 4.0, the amount of loans available has been raised by another NT$800 billion (US$28.6 billion) for a total of NT$4.25 trillion (US$151.8 billion) since the first wave of loans began going out. Preferential interest rates for policy borrowing are also available.</p>

<p>Relief financing assistance for startups has been newly expanded, and individual and groups that borrow to establish cram schools, after-school care centers, and preschools are eligible for new interest rate subsidies.</p>

<p><strong>■</strong> <strong>Reducing burdens</strong>: These measures aim to lighten the load for the general public. On the power front, summer electricity rates were suspended for residential customers in June, and only were applied to electricity usage after the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours of use in July. Summer rates were completely waived for disadvantaged care groups, vocational craft centers for the mentally handicapped, social welfare organizations, nursing centers and households equipped to care for physically handicapped family members. Service businesses and agricultural customers also received discounts based on reductions in revenue. Tenants in state-owned enterprise residential units and on non-public-use, state-owned land have been granted 20 percent rent reductions until June 2022. Finally, natural gas rates for passenger rental car businesses have been cut by half from July through September.</p>

<p><strong>Quintuple stimulus vouchers</strong></p>

<p><strong>■&nbsp;</strong>Each eligible individual can receive NT$5,000 (US$180) worth of vouchers in digital or paper form. To incentivize the use of the digital vouchers, more options are on offer for registering and pooling the voucher money to credit card accounts and using e-payment tools. Subsidies will also be available for small businesses to purchase electronic payment systems, and special QR codes will be designed for businesses to identify users of digital vouchers. Government ministries will also be rolling out their own eight additional types of vouchers. These measures will make the overall scheme accessible, easy to use and beneficial for the economy. </p>

<p><strong>General Manager of VeSA- Mr. Kronos Wu</strong>
	<br>Mr. Kronos Wu is the second generation of Vietnamese Taiwanese companies. His parents went to Vietnam to develop in the early 1990s. He was no stranger to Southeast Asia since he was a child, and traveling between Southeast Asia and Taiwan is even more commonplace. However, in recent years, he has felt that the overall development speed of Southeast Asia has made a big leap, which is faster than China’s economic growth. The current economic growth period of Southeast Asia is just in time for the take-off of digital e-commerce, and Vietnam has a smart phone. The most important opportunity for the rapid development of e-commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. Kronos Wu established VeSA, an e-commerce accelerator in Vietnam, and use Vietnam as the first overseas base. VeSA not only provides high-standard hardware equipment, but also hopes to help more Taiwanese products expand into the Vietnamese market.

<p>The dental clinic management system will be developed in 2018. In addition to providing registration and electronic medical records systems, it will integrate ERP, CRM and other management systems. In addition, an AI engine is introduced into the medical record system to perform deep learning such as auxiliary diagnosis and disease risk prediction on dental radiological images. AI artificial intelligence must be used to redefine the dental industry.</p>

<p>The Vietnam branch was established in August 2019, and the international cloud version of the medical record management system was published in November. Currently, more than 114 users have registered and used it in 12 countries on four continents. The Vietnam Dental Clinic was also established in the seven districts of Ho Chi Minh in May 2020.</p>

He teamed up with former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, to establish the law tech startup Proxifile to use AI to accelerate and simplify the claiming process.</p></blockquote><p>Bankruptcy claims are some of the most common types of cases to appear in civil court in the US. Because the US is a state of law and has a mature legal system, it can be very complicated for people to recover money and property they are owed due to countless documents to be filed, obscure laws to study and strategize about, and lots of procedures to be followed which have scant tolerance for error.</p><p>In society nowadays, more and more products, real estate, and other kinds of financial tools have been created based on contracts, which means that everyone has the possibility to end up as a creditor one day when the other side of the contract does not fulfill its obligations. No longer is it just large businesses that are creditors who are owed money, property, or performance. Now individuals and small businesses are equally likely to end up as a creditor. However filing a lawsuit to try to recover money is always a painful, complicated, and expensive process for average citizens.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/cde/620/ab5/cde620ab534ee2f5340a42d7162067986448b568.jpg" alt="PROXIFILE" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Filing a lawsuit to get back the money is always a painful process for average citizens. / Photograph : PROXIFILE</p><p>For instance, in the 2008 financial crisis, there were lots of people who lost their money when financial institutions and markets collapsed. Although many individuals pursued matters in court through a lawsuit, many could not afford lawyers to pursue claims through the court, particularly when big bankrupt debtors hired sophisticated legal counsel to complicate matters. &ldquo;Large debtors will claim bankruptcy when they still owe many many small creditors, not only individuals but also small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs), and the creditors not only have to fill out a complicated claims form correctly, but they also need to identify and provide the right supporting evidence and determine the most advantageous legal way to present their claim. If they do not complete the forms, provide the right evidence, and select the best legal positioning and file it correctly then they may have no claim at all,&rdquo; said Neil Peretz, co-founder of Proxifile.</p><p>Besides filling out the complicated claim forms in time, with bankruptcy claims, even small mistakes can put the claim in jeopardy, like providing insufficient supporting evidence, mischaracterization of the claim, and failure to exhaust remedies, etc. Hiring a specialist bankruptcy lawyer to take care of every procedure should relieve the burden, but the consulting fee might be as high as USD$500~800 per hour, and average citizens can&rsquo;t afford this price -especially when it&rsquo;s unknown how many hours the lawyer will require to do the work.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/a9c/1a5/c0d/a9c1a5c0d6b7ebce3c669ef08a3595921bd4c574.jpg" alt="Proxifile" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Neil Peretz observed that lots of people in the US were bothered by the complexity of creditor claims in bankruptcy and property. He teamed up with former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, to establish the law tech startup Proxifile to use AI to accelerate and simplify the claiming process. / Photograph : Neil Peretz</p><h2>Claims as the Service: Claims Automation</h2><p>Neil Peretz, as a serial entrepreneur and founder of several tech companies including Contract Wrangler and PocketMail, decided to leverage the technology to help people efficiently file the claims. He teamed up with his friend and former Goldman Sachs director, Cassindy Chao Bierhaus, as well as recruited experienced software engineering leader, Manchi Leung, to help build the engineering team. Combining their expertise from law, finance, and engineering, they quickly rolled out the AI engine which can guide creditors to identify and provide the right information and documents, and then the AI software makes assessments about the best filing strategies and claims positioning. Furthermore, the AI engine tracks the filing process to make sure creditors are alerted to case developments and progress in their claim process. By using its own software and dashboards, the company aspires to provide clients with the same level of detail and intelligence as traditional business software systems, which is not a typical strength for lawyers.</p><p>&ldquo;Neil possesses rich experience in law; he has been a financial services regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as a Trial Attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice and General Counsel at multiple financial services companies. When he and I decided to co-found Proxifile, I was truly fascinated by the company&rsquo;s mission to help individuals and small businesses and couldn&rsquo;t say no,&rdquo; said Cassindy.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/f4c/9f6/d61/f4c9f6d61619477175de3a496c74d3cd03336249.jpg" alt="PROXIFILE2" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Proxifile will guide you on how to prepare your lawsuit. / Photograph : PROXIFILE</p><p>When creditors are using Proxifile&rsquo;s engine, first they fill the simple intake form and upload supporting documents, review, and sign to quick start the claim. After initial analysis by the AI engine, Proxifile also has an expert team of specialist attorneys to review the claims to improve the size or speed up the recovery. Making sure everything is perfect, Proxifile then assembles and files an official Proof of Claim and supporting legal memoranda and documentation with the relevant court, and the users can see new filings and read updates from the dashboard.</p><p>Neil believes that high lawyer consulting fees shouldn&rsquo;t be the barrier for people to claim the property, so instead of charging by hours with high fees, Proxifile&rsquo;s upfront charges for every bankruptcy claim is USD$ 250, which makes filing the lawsuit affordable for everyone.</p><h2>Leverage Taiwan&rsquo;s engineering talents</h2><p>Proxifile closed the Pre-seed round with USD$ 2.3M this March and the investors include the Founder of Linkedin, the former CEO of American Express, and Taiwanese VC firm Darwin Ventures.</p><p>The Bankruptcy Claims service has been launched and is already helping people get back their money. Recently, they also began beta testing their forthcoming Property Claims Solution to solve the dispute and ensure full compliance and transparency of landlords.</p><p>&ldquo;Our AI engine and claims service are not just for Americans, there are lots of people and businesses from other countries who are involved in business in the United States and become creditors and claimants there. They can also leverage our AI engine,&rdquo; said Neil.</p><p>As a Taiwan employment gold card holder, Neil has lived in Taiwan for a time and knows there are so many talented engineers there. Proxifile&rsquo;s Vice President of Engineering, Manchi Leung, is building the research and software development center in Taiwan. &ldquo;Taiwan is an important research center for Proxifile, and we plan to hire many employees here,&rdquo; said Manchi. Given the engineering talents from Taiwan, Neil and Proxifile can continuously add more functions to the product and offer people more affordable and transparent access to their legal rights.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47482">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47482</a></p>', '615/d15/5a2/615d155a2bee0700853069.jpg', 1, '2021-10-06 03:28:24', '2024-09-01 21:33:11', null);

Co-founders Hsuan Lee and Edwin Yen come with abundant hands-on experience in the blockchain industry, both boasting abundant experiences in the crypto space. The two worked previously at blockchain start-up Cobinhood, creating a blockchain with 10,000 transactions per second.</p><p>Earlier this year, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) craze swept across the world. An NFT is a digital collectible stored on blockchain, which ensures assets are hacker-proof and provides public proof of ownership over a piece of digital asset, like an artwork.</p><p>Viewed as a fringe hobby of tech-savvy consumers previously, these kinds of digital assets quickly gained popularity and signals great market potential. Artist Beeple sold an image collage on blockchain worth USD$ 69 million at a Christie&rsquo;s auction sale in March. NFT demonstrates a fast-moving development, growing nearly tenfold from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the transaction volume of the NFT market came to USD$ 338.04 million.</p><p>While NFT took the world by storm, most people still haven&rsquo;t got a clue when it comes to purchasing digital collectibles. Blockchain applications are still Greek to many. The good news is, start-ups like portto are working their way to make blockchain applications easy and accessible to all.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/279/b04/db3/279b04db31a16147b115dded4a08a24aa35f8e3b.jpg" alt="nft" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Earlier this year, the non-fungible tokens (NFT) craze swept across the world. / Photograph : nft via fiverr</p><h2>Perking up tedious NFT transaction process</h2><p>During a networking event hosted by Blocto and supported by AppWorks, Blocto first came in touch with Mikhael Naayem, Chief Business Officer of Dapper Labs. Dapper Labs built the Flow blockchain, a more efficient infrastructure for consumers compared with Ethereum. &ldquo;We partnered with Dapper Labs as both teams look in the same direction. That is, we are looking forward to building a blockchain application ecosystem,&rdquo; said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/985/bab/cf0/985babcf05553fd673fab4c14fb25745bffafe40.jpg" alt="NBA Top Shot" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>With the Flow blockchain, portto offered services on sports platform NBA Top Shot, which sells digital collectibles that allows basketball fans to buy and collect NBA highlights. &nbsp;Photograph : NBA</p><p>With the FLOW blockchain, portto offered services on sports platform NBA Top Shot, which sells digital collectibles that allows basketball fans to buy and collect NBA highlights.</p><p>Foraying into the NFT trading market is a strategic move for portto. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult for blockchain wallets like Blocto to bring in users who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the blockchain technology. However, as NFT gains attention among the general public, we are seeing an opportunity to leverage our user-friendly interface and bring in blockchain laymen to our ecosystem,&rdquo; said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto. NBA TopShot is a case in point, bringing basketball lovers to the blockchain realm.</p><p>Aside from NBA TopShot, a wide array of digital collectibles could be purchased on Blocto. Users could purchase Vault by CNN, which are historical news moments, with the app. Such as the piece in which CNN projects Trump&rsquo;s win of the presidential election, is valued at 20 USD. MotoGP Ignition, which features NFTs that represent motorbikes and personalities in the real world premier motorcycle racing world championship, could also be purchased with the Blocto wallet.</p><h2>Blocto memorizes your private key for you</h2><p>Blockchain wallets are a gateway to interact with blockchain-based applications (also called dApps). Most blockchain wallets on the market require users to be familiar with blockchain. For example, a &ldquo;private key&rdquo; is generated once a blockchain account is open, then users need to memorize the private key securely themselves. Or else, there is no way to recover.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/04d/9b3/2b8/04d9b32b83801a59e7c1169435bc8e4c2093ae37.jpg" alt="截圖 2021-08-22 11.55.34.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Photograph: Blocto</p><p>Blocto makes accessing blockchain as simple as signing up for Facebook and Gmail. Simply type in your email address, and then a blockchain wallet is ready to use. &ldquo;With regard to account creation, we take a hybrid approach, coupling decentralized and centralized systems together,&rdquo; said Hsuan Lee, co-founder and CEO of portto.</p><p>Users can decide whether their Blocto accounts are decentralized or centralized, meaning whether their accounts are managed and safeguarded by people other than themselves. &ldquo;Only 10% of our users switch their accounts to fully decentralized ones, &ldquo; said Hsuan Lee. Although the scenario contradicts the biggest selling point of blockchain technology, it nevertheless proves that users value convenience more than decentralization.</p><h2>Game changer: breaking the barrier between different chains</h2><p>&ldquo;Portto anticipates to erase obstacles of cross-chain trading,&rdquo; said Edwin Yen, co-founder and COO of portto. Portto rolled out the Blocto points system to fulfill that cause. Blocto points serve as an intermediary that could be used to pay the fees across different chains. Portto envisions a future in which boundaries between different blockchains are non-existent.</p><p>With most wallets on the market, users need to understand which chain each dApp runs on, which could be painful for users as information is scattered. For example, CryptoKitties runs on Flow. That means users must access its service with one particular cryptocurrency, the FLOW. It could cause trouble for users who possess only Ethereum or Bitcoin.</p><p>Currently, with Blocto, users could access dApps built on various chains such as Ethereum, Flow and Solana, and all transactions could be paid via Blocto points, saving the trouble of finding out which cryptocurrency should be used.</p><p>User experience is at the core of portto&rsquo;s product development. People often shy away from dApps, as they are difficult to understand due to the intricate blockchain technology. &ldquo;Intuitive design allows users to access dApp service without having to understand the blockchain technology,&rdquo; said Hsuan Lee.</p><h2>Token sale: prelude to the Blocto ecosystem</h2><p>In April 2021, portto completed 8 million USD private token sale. Investors include prominent individuals and accelerators, including 500 Startups, AppWorks, Animoca Brands, Alameda Research, EVG Capital, June Fund, Dapper Labs CEO and Rally CEO.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/b9a/896/9b3/b9a8969b3c6cb6d9d5f029768b62aea6a3e8a595.jpg" alt="Portto-7" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>The team has an average of 5+ experience in the burgeoning blockchain industry. With a highly passionate group of seasoned marketers, engineers and designers, Blocto is poised for success. / Photograph : Portto</p><p>Portto&rsquo;s funding comes in the form of token sales, where investors of portto receive virtual &ldquo;Blocto Tokens (BLT)&rdquo; instead of shares. BLT tokens are a way to liven up the Blocto ecosystem, as 90% of BLT holders are incumbent users and app providers of Blocto. Restricting token sale to strategic investors is healthy for expanding the ecosystem, as their profit is tied with the ecosystem&rsquo;s long-term development.</p><p>BLT holders can make critical decisions in the ecosystem such as deciding which chains to integrate.</p><p>&ldquo;BLT token serves as an excellent reward system that aligns the interests of users and dApp developers. Users get rewarded for storing their assets in Blocto and using dApps frequently. On the other hand, dApps get rewarded for bringing users into the ecosystem,&rdquo; said Edwin Yen. Portto is on the optimistic lookout of building a dApp ecosystem.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47456">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47456</a></p>', '619/1ff/e4b/6191ffe4b1b24093674045.jpeg', 1, '2021-11-15 06:40:51', '2024-09-01 21:32:09', null);

The latest SurrealM is a remote learning platform developed by metaverse in the education field.Through teachers and students playing the role of creating their own digital twin, teaching and group discussions can go on in the virtual world, breaking the traditional school walls, and using AI learning feedback. In the future, coupled with the application of blockchain decentralization and other technologies, meta-school will gradually emerge and enter the truly decentralized virtual education world!</p><p>Professor Hsin-Chien Huang, a new media artist, shared how the combination of metaverse and art, led the audience to a feast of metaverse art across space and imagination. Metaverse is not only has great advantages in entertainment and social interaction, including professional work, creation, belief and others, but also the social and cultural will be developed faster, and it will also have a positive impact on national development. Professor Hsin-Chien Huang said that we are now gradually entering a world of digital twin and integration of virtual and reality under the concept of digital twin. As Taiwan enters the metaverse, we should first think about what our life style is? What is the value of Taiwan compared to other countries&#39; cultural industries? This is a question worthy of our deep consideration.</p><p>Known as &quot;VR Godmother&quot; is also the general manager of Digi Space Co., Ltd., Cori Shieh is an important promoter of Taiwan&#39;s XR industry. She said that the Z generation (born from 1995 to 2009), also known as the digital natives, is no stranger to the current digital technology. From the recent hot news, there are examples of young people earning 5 million Taiwan dollars through paintings, many young people in Korea are keen on buying land in the virtual world, and young people in Southeast Asia are earning money by playing games (Play to earn) in NFT. Earn money by creating and selling, buying land, and playing games. What&rsquo;s interesting is that you don&rsquo;t have to have a VR device to enter the metaverse. You can also participate through a tablet phone, which is completely different from traditional thinking. General manager Cori Shieh in response to the development of metaverse, virtual workspaces, metaverse/NFT games, music/cultural/religious celebrations and others. are likely to become popular applications in the next three years, and in the next five years, there are also opportunities to promote emerging careers related to NFT, virtual worlds and metaverse, such as NFT social marketers, NFT financial managers, virtual space designers, tour guides, metaverse lawyers, consultants/ counselors and others.

<h3>Entrusting your employees</h3>

<p>One essential factor to attract and retain qualified employees is to allow them the space they need to grow, and entrusting them with the autonomy to carry out their tasks. Especially the young workforce from generation Z values very much independence and free exploration in their work environment.</p>

<h3>Flexible or remote working is a plus</h3>

<p>The pandemic has altered our working behaviors with working hours and destinations becoming flexible. As the pandemic continues to thwart physical gatherings around the world, companies need to establish well-rounded policies and employee communication mechanisms for Work From Home. One company-wide survey from iKala revealed that more than half of our staff believe that working from home is more productive than working at the office, and 52% prefer to continue remote work even after the pandemic.</p>

<p>Already, around two-thirds of our employees continue to work remotely every day, and we are committed to encouraging better work and life integration for our employees — enabling them to work from anywhere that yields the same results as the office would.</p>

<h3>Investing in training &amp; development</h3>

<p>The technology is evolving at a staggering pace, and many roles now require people to be equipped with new skills and competencies in order to keep up with the changes and continue growing as an organisation. In addition to offering learning opportunities for employees, it’s equally important to build a workforce that can self-learn new ways of working to remain efficient and competitive. For example, since the pandemic, here at iKala, we have introduced a new series of learning resources to help our employees improve their managing skills and tech knowledge. We also introduced recommended reading lists for employees to learn by themselves and expand their areas of interest. How to help employees increase their adaptability and maintain a growth mindset is essential for any company.</p>

We trained for marathons together and after running for a while that&rsquo;s when we started to talk about starting something together.&rdquo;</p><p>The duo first formed an idea about combining the power of AI and IoT at the end of 2015 and went on to launch thingnario in 2017. Speaking about why he took the plunge into this business venture, Professor Hsu says it&rsquo;s because he has known Cardy for a long time and he trusts him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s already a lot of business trust between us and he is a professional in everything he does.&rdquo;</p><p>The name thingnario comes from the combination of &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo; and &lsquo;scenario&rsquo;, meaning its AIoT solutions can be used in many different scenarios and applications. Its mission is &#39;to mitigate the IT technology gap in the physical industry with software innovations&#39;.</p><p>When we asked why he chose to focus on the renewable energy sector, he said initially they didn&rsquo;t know which industry to focus on &mdash; it was a process of trial and error. &ldquo;We tried applying our solutions in many different industries such as healthcare, finance &amp; banking and even plastic manufacturing. But we quickly learned those weren&rsquo;t suitable areas for us to apply our solutions as it was hard to be scalable in those sectors. So we turned to renewable energy as we predicted that it was soon going to experience rapid growth and there will be a demand for scalable AI solutions to optimize energy efficiency. And we wanted our startup to capitalize on the potential growth and development of this sector.&rdquo;</p><p>Fast forward to 2021, there is now a burgeoning market demand for renewable energy as countries around the world are pushing for an energy transition into a low-carbon future. In the span of 5 years, thingnario now manages over 2,000 solar farms around the world with a total capacity of more than 1GW. It is also growing rapidly in many different international markets such as Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Mexico. <strong>With over 800 clients worldwide, thingnario has an impressive client retention rate of 99.6%.</strong></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/51f/008/fa6/51f008fa6c6ebf37d7282dee0dfee211ec4e1c9f.jpg" alt="慧景jpeg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a flexible plug-and-play system that can be deployed anywhere and withstand extreme temperatures at remote solar farms,&rdquo; says Professor Hsu. / Photograph: thingnario</p><h2>Boosting solar energy efficiency with AI-driven data analytics</h2><p>thingnario combines Taiwan&rsquo;s expertise in hardware manufacturing to make deployment of its software solutions very easy for customers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a flexible plug-and-play system that can be deployed anywhere and withstand extreme temperatures at remote solar farms,&rdquo; says Professor Hsu.</p><p>Its scalable solutions use AI/ML and computer vision technology to analyze huge amounts of data to establish and predict solar production models and patterns. This provides businesses with real time insights and actionable data via instant mobile notifications that help enable faster and better decision making.</p><p>thingnario&rsquo;s advanced AI technology also has the capability to differentiate many types of faults in real time.

The Southeast Asia market will be a key focus for them in 2022. They are also making strategic plans on entering the Japanese market, in which the government recently announced its plans to raise the renewable energy target to 36-38% by 2030.</p><p>Speaking about the future of thingnario, Professor Hsu hopes this is just the beginning of more software startups he will see in Taiwan. &ldquo;I hope Taiwan can have its own Paypal Mafia.

We are committed to backing the next generation of entrepreneurs in Greater Southeast Asia (ASEAN+Taiwan) and helping them to facilitate the region&rsquo;s transition into the digital age. Building off the firm&rsquo;s decade-plus of experience, AppWorks works closely with early-stage founders to achieve product-market fit, while helping growth-stage companies establish sustainable business models at scale.</p><p>Starting in 2018, blockchain was incorporated in the firm&rsquo;s core mandate. We believe that the technology is currently driving a massive paradigm shift, opening up new disruptive and innovative opportunities for the next generation of entrepreneurs as the world transitions into the web3 era.</p><p>In 2021, blockchain entered a mass adoption phase. With the emergence of new innovative applications such as DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and web3 infrastructure, an unprecedented number of new funds, retail investors, and users have flocked to the crypto world, creating a flywheel effect that has facilitated the formation of key web3 infrastructure that we believe will usher in a new era of large-scale commercialization.</p><p>&ldquo;As the world decentralizes, will development vary between different countries and regions?&rdquo; This is a question that we&rsquo;ve mulled over years. With the accelerated development of blockchain, we recognize that, in fact, regional dynamics have become more pronounced.

The emergence of diversified crypto markets is driving growth in the region to meet different market conditions and leading to new business models and approaches in the industry that can be applied globally.</p><p>The following is an overview of our analysis and views on each major market in the region:</p><h2>Indonesia: Crypto Investment Outstripping Public Equities</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/8f3/8d2/5ba/8f38d25bad3218adcc6aa925f8dea20420483424.jpg" alt="Indonesia- Crypto Investment Outstripping Public E" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Photograph : AppWorks</p><p>Indonesia, the world&rsquo;s fourth largest population and the largest in GSEA, is estimated to have an <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2021/04/15/grassroot-strategy-to-realize-financial-inclusion-in-indonesia.html">unbanked population of 66%.</a> Based on market size alone, Indonesia has become an important market for the development of blockchain. Indonesia is entering a financial paradigm shift driven by blockchain and cryptoassets, and overall development is trending towards exponential growth. According to <a href="https://vnexplorer.net/over-6-5-million-indonesians-bought-or-sold-crypto-in-first-5-months-of-2021-ministry-of-trade-says-a2021214858.html">statistics</a> from Indonesia&rsquo;s Ministry of Trade, during the first five months of 2021, more than 6.5 million people in Indonesia traded cryptocurrencies&mdash;far exceeding the 2.2 million who traded public equities&mdash;totaling US$25 billion in cryptocurrency transactions, compared to US$4.4 billion over the same period in 2020, representing year-on-year growth of 470%. With statistics like these, it comes as no surprise that cryptocurrency has become the most popular investment category among Indonesian retail traders.</p><p>Compared with other countries, the Indonesian government is relatively positive towards crypto. Since September 2018, a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cryptocurrency-in-indonesia">series of laws</a> have been enacted, signaling the open attitude of the Indonesian government. The Commodity Futures Exchange Supervisory Board (BAPPEBTI) oversees cryptocurrency-related issues and has provided legal frameworks for licensing and trading. Currently, Indonesians can legally own and trade a total 229 different cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Indonesia&rsquo;s crypto landscape is underlined by the rapid development and adoption of exchanges, wallets, asset management tools, and other DeFi applications. For example, Indodax, established in 2014, is Indonesia&rsquo;s leading exchange with more than 4.7 million users. With increasing acceptance of investment in cryptocurrencies by the general public, new areas of development, such as investment platform <a href="https://usenobi.com/">NOBI</a>, that provide asset management services that cater to crypto users will mark the next wave of growth.</p><h2>Philippines: Massive User-Driven Growth</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/731/c61/87b/731c6187b67d22b92bd386d2c782cd29b7e68c5d.jpg" alt="Philippines: Massive User-Driven Growth.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>圖片來源 : AppWorks</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> (YGG) broke out in the Philippines and became a global phenomenon. Evolving from its initial function of assisting Axie Infinity in recruiting and training players, YGG is now home to more than 1,500 NFT game guilds based in the Philippines. YGG provides players with digital asset management, game scholarships, and community support&mdash;becoming the world&rsquo;s largest NFT gaming guild.</p><p>According to <a href="https://playercounter.com/axie-infinity/">Playercounter</a>, more than 40% of Axie Infinity players hail from the Philippines alone. Play-to-earn has proven to provide meaningful income to users, effectively alleviating economic pressure caused by the pandemic for many users.</p><p>This model of massive user acquisition to drive ecosystem growth is a unique characteristic of blockchain development in the Philippines. We anticipate that with the mass inflow of capital and users, there will be a corresponding entrepreneurial response that will lead to the creation of new and innovative applications in the Philippines. We have seen this trend emerge with projects like NFT marketplace <a href="https://vention.app/home/">Vention</a> and gaming guild management and data platform <a href="https://www.blockchainspace.asia/">BlockchainSpace.</a></p><h2>Singapore: Leveraging the Strength of Asia&rsquo;s Financial Center</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/80e/394/ad8/80e394ad8d09b0e4ac6230d394f9c84ec1c480e7.jpg" alt="03.-Singapore.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Photograph : AppWorks</p><p>Singapore has always been known as Asia&rsquo;s financial center, building off the government&rsquo;s proactive policies over the past several decades. A similar trajectory is also taking shape in the country&rsquo;s blockchain development. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is the leading regulatory body overseeing cryptoassets, and has long demonstrated a relatively open and friendly stance on the development of blockchain and cryptoassets within the city-state.</p><p>As early as 2017, MAS issued &ldquo;<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/~/media/MAS/Regulations%20and%20Financial%20Stability/Regulations%20Guidance%20and%20Licensing/Securities%20Futures%20and%20Fund%20Management/Regulations%20Guidance%20and%20Licensing/Guidelines/A%20Guide%20to%20Digital%20Token%20Offerings%20%2014%20Nov%202017.pdf">A Guide to Digital Token Offering</a>&rdquo; which established the Singapore government&rsquo;s policy framework for ICOs, issuers and related platforms, under the purview of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). In January 2021, the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/payment-services-amendment-bill">Payment Service Act</a>&rdquo; (PSA) was launched, regulating all cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and digital payment services in Singapore.</p><p>As a result, there has been an emergence of several new blockchain-related applications. For example, <a href="https://www.biconomy.io/">Biconomy</a>, which builds transaction infrastructure for blockchain applications and optimizes cross-chain transaction experience; <a href="https://www.xfers.com/sg?">Xfers</a>, a developer of financial electronic payments; and <a href="https://www.vauld.com/">Vauld</a>, a service provider covering cryptocurrency transactions, lending, and wallets. In the future, we expect more projects coming out of Singapore in cryptocurrency-related asset securitization, license compliance, and international exchanges.</p><h2>Thailand: From Late Mover to Frontrunner</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/65e/fb4/166/65efb4166db112092208667370bdd92256fc9df4.jpg" alt="05.-Thailand.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Photograph : AppWorks</p><p>While Thailand&rsquo;s blockchain ecosystem can be considered quite early, 2021 marked an acceleration point with several milestones. In November, Thailand&rsquo;s first blockchain unicorn was born as crypto exchange <a href="https://www.bitkub.com/">Bitkub</a> sold a <a href="https://www.thaiexaminer.com/thai-news-foreigners/2021/11/06/bitkub-thailand-first-unicorn-success/">51% stake</a> worth US$535 million to Siam Commercial Bank. Paired together with logistics provider <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2124699/flash-group-becomes-first-thai-unicorn">Flash Express&rsquo;s</a> newly minted billion-dollar valuation, Thailand welcomed its first unicorns of the internet and Web3 era respectively within a five-month period.</p><p>Bitkub&rsquo;s success is galvanizing the Thai blockchain ecosystem, demonstrating that Thailand can develop scalable blockchain infrastructure. Bitkub alumni and seasoned Web2 entrepreneurs are diving into Thailand&rsquo;s blockchain space, just as we&rsquo;ve witnessed in other markets.</p><p>In fact, we can already see the emergence of more mature and advanced Web3 applications. For example, the emergence of cross-chain data oracle platform Band Protocol and metaverse gaming guild GuildFi show the level of innovation and reiteration happening in the market. We believe that in the near future, we will see more projects in the NFT space, building off Bangkok&rsquo;s rich fashion and design industry and the country&rsquo;s active NFT artist community.</p><h2>Vietnam: The Axie Infinity Effect</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/b62/e5e/2ce/b62e5e2ce8016c4bae4a4f4a10bff57a6ebc2a23.jpg" alt="06.-Vietnam.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Photograph : AppWorks</p><p>When it comes to Vietnam, the most well-known player is <a href="https://skymavis.com/">Sky Mavis</a>, the developer behind the killer NFT-based game Axie Infinity. According to <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/axie-infinity/sales/summary">CryptoSlam statistics</a>, since its launch in 2018, the total amount of NFT transactions on Axie Infinity reached more than US$3.7 billion, with more than <a href="https://thenewscrypto.com/axie-infinitys-daily-active-users-increased-by-almost-5000-in-six-months/">two million daily active users</a>, culminating in Sky Mavis&rsquo;s recently completed US$152 million Series B round of financing.</p><p>The impact of Sky Mavis&rsquo;s success on Vietnam can be observed from two perspectives. First, it is driving the growth of Vietnam&rsquo;s local NFT gaming ecosystem and attracting international capital to accelerate development and adoption. For example, in October, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/26/sipher-raises-6-8m-for-pc-based-blockchain-game-world-of-sipheria/">Sipher raised US$6.8 million</a> in seed financing from major global investors. In addition, there&rsquo;s been a surge in casual and semi-casual GameFi projects coming out of the woodwork including <a href="https://mydefipet.com/">My DeFi Pet</a>, <a href="https://mytheria.io/">Mytheria</a>, <a href="https://thetanarena.com/">Thetan Arena</a>, and <a href="https://faraland.io/">Faraland.</a></p><p>Second, Vietnamese users have demonstrated high levels of acceptance for blockchain and cryptoassets. According to the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/">2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index</a> survey conducted by Chainalysis, Vietnam ranked first globally in terms of overall adoption. Among three indicators, on-chain value received, on-chain retail value received, and P2P exchange trade volume, Vietnam ranked in the top five in the world. We anticipate that new applications in DeFi, wallets, and asset management like we see with <a href="https://kyber.network/">Kyber Network&rsquo;s</a> Liquidity Hub will highlight the next wave of blockchain innovation in Vietnam.</p><h2>Taiwan: A Huge Digital Market Driven by Engineering Talent</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c09/f5a/7ef/c09f5a7ef884bef639fedaeae0f3df8741e74422.jpg" alt="04.-Taiwan.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>Photograph : AppWorks</p><p>Compared with other markets in the GSEA region, Taiwan has two notable characteristics and advantages in blockchain development. First, Taiwan is home to a massive digital gaming and entertainment market. To illustrate this market size, according to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/state-of-mobile-2021/">App Annie</a>, in 2020, Taiwanese consumers spent US$2.44 billion in the App Store, equal to total spending from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia combined. Second, Taiwan has accumulated a wealth of engineering talent across manufacturing, software, and hardware integration. This talent pool has formed the core of Taiwan&rsquo;s blockchain industry.</p><p>In 2021, Taiwan also joined the global NFT wave with early-stage activity. Leveraging the island&rsquo;s fertile digital gaming and entertainment market, Taiwanese founders are adopting NFTs to create products, services, and new business models. Musicians, artists, game publishers, and influencers have embraced NFTs to build public awareness and tap into this new digital format of ownership, demonstrating immense promise for large-scale commercial adoption of NFTs.</p><p>Since the advent of Ethereum, Taiwan&rsquo;s local engineers have continued to explore the frontiers of blockchain development, becoming a key driving force in the crypto world. Taiwan is home to several notable projects led by seasoned teams, including Perpetual Protocol, which provides Virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM) to implement perpetual contract solutions; smart contract wallet <a href="https://blocto.portto.io/en/">Blocto</a> has become the go-to wallet for Flow&mdash;with more than <a href="https://flowscan.org/staking/overview">80% of Flow users</a> trusting Blocto for Flow Token pledges. In cross-chain applications, Blocto also supports Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Avalanche (c-chain), and Polygon, among other mainstream public chains.</p><h2>Bright Days Ahead</h2><p>Just a few years ago, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find the words web3, blockchain, DeFi, or NFTs uttered anywhere outside of niche crypto spheres in this part of the world. Now, sentiment from founders and investors across the region have evidently shifted from &ldquo;why web3?&rdquo; to &ldquo;how do I get a piece of it?&rdquo;&mdash;largely in this past year alone.</p><p>Taiwan is at the forefront from a technical perspective, with an unparalleled engineering pool in terms of cost and performance; Indonesia is emerging as massive market for web3 consumers, now with crypto traders outnumbering stock traders by severalfold; Philippines is in a close second, with everyday users showing an uncanny demand for GameFi to make ends meet; Thailand&rsquo;s historically nascent ecosystem is expected to garner significantly more attention now with their first crypto unicorn; Vietnam, given Axie&rsquo;s success, is quickly distinguishing itself as a the world&rsquo;s NFT gaming hub; and lastly, Singapore&rsquo;s position as the region&rsquo;s financial and management hub will likely extend into the web3 era.</p><p>Any doubts of whether or not web3 is here to stay were certainly eroded by the massive strides that the regional ecosystem has taken in 2021. Looking forward, the development and adoption of web3 is looking especially bright. Although crypto markets will likely ebb and flow in the coming months and years, with the occasional bears and dips, many stakeholders across the value chain have already gotten taste, and will likely only want more.</p><blockquote><p>The 2021 Greater Southeast Asia Blockchain Ecosystem Map is authored by AppWorks.

	<p>Since entering the Taiwanese market in 2018, Lingumi has seen rapid user growth and as of today, more than 10% of Taiwanese parents have already registered for Lingumi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a member of the Garage+ startup network which is founded by the Epoch Foundation, Lingumi is an edtech startup that focuses on teaching foundational English to children between 2-6 years old with interactive learning games and lessons.</p>

<p>Since entering the Taiwanese market in 2018, Lingumi has seen rapid user growth and as of today, more than 10% of Taiwanese parents have already registered for Lingumi.</p>

<p>The company is also growing fast in many other Asian markets that include China, Indonesia, Philippines, Japan and South Korea, but “Taiwan is the market where we have the biggest brand identity,” said Toby Mather, Founder &amp; CEO of Lingumi.</p>

<p>Initially, the startup focused on the EU market and taught English to children in Germany by building an interactive toy. But as the company pivoted to a software-only business, Toby saw the potential in Chinese-speaking markets, especially Taiwan, because of its strong market for learning English, and how Taiwanese parents place a great deal of importance on their children’s education.</p>

<h2>A \'magic window\' for children to learn English</h2>

<p>
	<iframe width="540" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uEiCLrbUNG4?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fmeet-global.bnext.com.tw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-gtm-yt-inspected-36661081_219="true" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_19="true"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Inspiration can strike anywhere and for Toby, it came about during his year abroad from Oxford University. During his studies, he spent a year teaching English to primary school children between 6-7 years old in Russia and Italy. It was during this time he saw that children who begin learning English in big groups, experience difficulty learning the words, accent, and structures of the English language.</p>

<p>He began researching ways on how to help children build a strong foundation in English before they even enter the classroom for the first time. His research back at Oxford showed that in early childhood, there is a \'magic window\', between ages 2-6, when children can more easily learn foreign languages, and their accents.</p>

<p>With a passion for teaching, Toby saw an opportunity where he could make a difference while doing something he loves. He founded Lingumi with the goal of making English learning fun and effective for preschool children, and importantly, it also has to be affordable and accessible for all. “What I care most about in the world, is I think that there\'s a very uneven or unequal access to the skills that really matter for a child,” said Toby.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2>Making digital teaching experiences feel more human with AI</h2>

<p>Lingumi uses an asynchronous teaching model and offers daily English lessons, interactive learning games, speech recognition games and video-based tasks to help with a child’s English learning. It leverages AI voice recognition technology to help children learn to say new words and phrases while improving their accents and pronunciations. AI also plays an important role in helping smooth the conversational flow that the child has with the teacher during lessons. Toby said this is an area of AI application they are investing a lot of effort in because the most important way they use AI is to make the speaking experience feel as human as possible.</p>

<p>The interactive teaching experience needs to feel human because Toby believes that the thing that is most central to education is the teacher and student relationship.</p>

<p>Speaking from his own experience of meeting his English teacher when he was 8 years old, Toby said the teacher changed his life. “I think for a child, if you give them one incredible teacher, it can really change their life, both emotionally and in terms of the skills they acquire through that teacher, that gives them the confidence to want to learn, but also gives them the actual skills they need. I don’t think a TV show, a YouTube video or a cartoon can do that in the same way. What we try to do that\'s different in the digital space, is to bring the magic of human teaching to your child.”</p>

<p>"I think for a child, if you give them one incredible teacher, it can really change their life," said Toby. / Photograph: Lingumi</p>

<h2>Localizing content to meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan</h2>

<p>Taiwan is currently one of Lingumi’s biggest markets, so when it comes to content creation, the company is focused on making specific content that is relevant and useful for families in Taiwan.</p>

<p>For example, Toby shared that the way preschoolers learn English is basically the same around the world but as children get older, they start to think more in their first language.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://bnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw/image/album/2021-12/img-1639475626-75847.jpg" alt="1124_lingumi-25" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Understanding how a Taiwanese child thinks through their first language allows Lingumi to design learning materials that meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan. / Photograph: Lingumi</p>

<p>So a 5 or 6 year old Taiwanese child will already start thinking through the lens of their first language because the structure of language is more tied to the first language. Taking this into account, we will understand why when an Italian child or German child learns English, they would naturally be able to use plurals and say for example, “two dogs”, whereas a Taiwanese child might say “two dog”. Understanding how a Taiwanese child thinks through their first language allows Lingumi to design learning materials that meet the needs of young learners in Taiwan.</p>

<p>As someone who loves to learn languages, Toby is currently learning Chinese which he considers as “one of the toughest challenges for a language learner.” Chinese is not an easy language to learn but Toby said it is important to learn this language if he wants to better engage at the local level with users in Taiwan. “I make a lot of videos for marketing, where I’m speaking Chinese and I want to just do that in an authentic way.”</p>

<p>Before the pandemic hit, Toby has traveled to Taiwan numerous times to meet families who use Lingumi. As for the future, Toby said that he would like to come back and visit more as he has loved every experience he had in Taiwan. “I do want to travel a lot more and come back to Taiwan a lot more frequently. Because for me, that is a very important way to connect to our customers to understand what they need from us. And that\'s how we build a better product — by listening to what our families want.”</p>

However, the market is extremely fragmented. Up to date, the market has not seen any unicorn rise up in the ed-tech scene,&rdquo; said JJ Xu, the founder of TalkMeUp. Therefore, JJ wanted to leverage AI to scale up and take part in the education startup business.</p><p>Prior to her venture in the startup sphere, JJ started out in the scientific field. Boasting a Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree in Microelectronics at Peking University, she chose to start her career down the business path due to her interest in realizing ideas in product campaigns. She worked at Groupon and Huawei, excelling as the head of sales in both companies. &ldquo;I think everyone is uncovering their purpose in life along the way. I&rsquo;ve found my true passion in business. More aptly put, to start a company on my own is my spark,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/b37/f6a/05e/b37f6a05ef28e93143ad9e13834f6b6ebf36dcf9.jpg" alt="jj_xu.1d0e9fb" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">JJ Xu chose to start her career down the business path due to her interest in realizing ideas in product campaigns, excelling as the head of sales in both companies. / Photograph : talkmeup</p><p>When asked why she continued down the business road, JJ said, &ldquo;I set up my first startup in 2012. I failed the first time. This experience led me to the decision of expanding my horizon in big corporations like Groupon and Huawei,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p>Later, JJ pursued an MBA degree from Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. &ldquo;It got me thinking. What the most invaluable takeaway at MBA school should be,&rdquo;said JJ Xu. &ldquo;Most of my peers answered almost in unison, that &lsquo;network resource&rsquo; and &lsquo;communication skills&rsquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be swell if we could scale and turn this into a business plan,&rdquo; said JJ Xu.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/5dd/814/d2d/5dd814d2decc2fc333bc87f8cfbc3772e2972cee.jpg" alt="speaker_speech_shutterstock_1170155062Resize 1280." class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">As an MBA graduate herself, JJ considered &quot;communication skills&quot; to be most valuable in terms of an MBA student. She aimed to scale &quot;speech education&quot; into an online education platform. / Photograph : Shutterstock</p><div data-aid="47574"><h2>Skill up and scale up</h2><p>As far as employee communication training goes, the traditional method is less than satisfactory. &ldquo;Many companies hire communication experts. They do best in offering &lsquo;qualitative analysis&rsquo;,&rdquo; observed JJ. Simply put, human experts can point out speaking problems you might have, end of story. Therefore, human-made suggestions fail to let you know the exact extent to which you should improve.</p><p>TalkMeUp aims to paint a better picture of communication performance by means of data-based insights. &ldquo;With our trained AI system, we analyze video, audio and speech content. This allows TalkMeUp to perform a more consistent and thorough analysis of one&rsquo;s communication performance,&rdquo; remarked JJ on TalkMeUp&rsquo;s interactive AI system.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/5a7/a17/c1f/5a7a17c1fd0f6ec97fa5326df4eb6afd9a7ccdb9.jpg" alt="talkmeup" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><div data-aid="47574">Similar to attending a zoom meeting, users talk into a camera.

Firstly, open API would allow TalkMeUp&rsquo;s patented video analyzer to be integrated with preexisting learning platforms, such as that of Coursera or Udemy. &ldquo;For users of the platform, they are empowered with a brand new way to practice speech,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p>Apart from open APIs, the metrics used to analyze communication performance will be altered according to the purpose of one&rsquo;s speech. Elements that make a speech successful are entirely different between a school teacher and a sales person. &ldquo;Bearing these differences in mind, customizing performance metrics is critical in the sense that communications want to raise awareness on different topics,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p>Currently, TalkMeUp adopts a tiered pricing strategy. Aside from depositing a lump sum fee upon subscription, additional charges are made when the user base continues to grow within the client company.</p><h2>Determined to make it work</h2><p>In Meet Global&rsquo;s exclusive interview, JJ walked us through some difficulties she faced in entrepreneurship. &ldquo;As a newcomer to the U.S., networks needed to be expanded so that business can run more smoothly,&rdquo; said JJ. She constantly needs to bond with investors, other startup founders and potential work talent for the company.</p><p>Furthermore, she said the pressure also came from whether she was able to obtain a work visa. &ldquo;I was under such immense pressure that a few silver strands of hair started to grow,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p>Finally, she received an O-1 visa for individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement. Taking a load off her mind, JJ said it&rsquo;s still a long way to go before TalkMeUp hits success. &ldquo;Regardless of raging storms in the path towards success, I will stand firm and carry on with my startup project,&rdquo; said JJ firmly.</p><h2>Visioning a global village: English, Mandarin, French and Russian services in progress</h2><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working hard to build a future in which everyone can access learning resources with no limitation and uncap their true potentials,&rdquo; said JJ ambitiously.</p><p>The team is also seeing potential in other language markets. TalkMeUp salesperson learned from customer feedback that language portfolio is expected to be expanded. &ldquo;Driven by the market demand, we are laying out plans to deliver services in Mandarin, French and Russian,&rdquo; said JJ.</p><p>The Chinese speaking world is TalkMeUp&rsquo;s next big game. As a native Chinese speaker, JJ has been connecting with the Chinese market since 2020.</p><p>&ldquo;Taiwan is one of our target markets. Before the pandemic, we had been keeping in touch with one of Taiwan&rsquo;s leading online English tutor platforms,&rdquo; said JJ. The popularity that English tutoring has received in Taiwan makes it an attractive destination for ed-tech startups like TalkMeUp.</p><p>Adding Mandarin services to its language portfolio is expected to expand its customer base and bring in more revenue. Having raised USD 1 million in the pre-seed round, TalkMeUp is preparing for seed round funding on the horizon.</p></div><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47574">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47574</a></p>', '61d/f87/c76/61df87c7610e7066131045.jpg', 1, '2022-01-13 02:03:54', '2024-09-01 21:17:28', null);

We work with startups closely and provide them with advice.</p><p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> It is like dating and getting married. VCs and startups need to keep finding a way to get used to each other, finding a way to support each other &mdash; just like how married couples need to find a way to live with each other.</p><p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> It depends on what kinds of VCs and startups. Different stages of VCs have different goals, and different stages of startups need different resources. Echoing what Joseph said, the relationship between VCs and startups is like getting married, because once you&rsquo;re married it&rsquo;ll always be messy when you want to get a divorce later on, just like when VCs invest in a startup and you cannot just pull back the money at any time.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/44a/ae5/3ed/44aae53ed1683239052c94a52fc5791cedd24025.jpg" alt="黃立安_Joseph Huang_Partner at Infinity Ventures_2020" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Partner of Headline Asia Joseph Huang feels the relationship between VC and startup is like dating and getting married. / Photograph : 賀大新攝影</p><h2>Q. What factors do you consider before you invest in a startup? What has been your favorite investment deal in the past few years?</h2><p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> Kiwibot is an investment deal that we&rsquo;ve made recently that I&rsquo;m very proud of. It develops food delivery robots and over 50 US colleges are already using their services. I really admire the diligence and toughness the founder has as an entrepreneur. The founder shows no fear in the face of difficulties and perseveres in solving problems.</p><p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> I&rsquo;m very proud that we invested in Calm. The founder is a serial entrepreneur. When he was stressed, he relied on meditation to help him de-stress. He has always been practicing meditation and studying the science behind it but back at that time, people didn&rsquo;t realize the potential of the mental health market. Founders of Calm met over 15 VCs at Silicon Valley but no one was interested. When I got a chance to chat with Calm&rsquo;s founders, I could tell they are truly passionate about meditation and understand the positive impacts they could bring for others. When you truly love what you do, no matter what happens, you will keep going, and I knew they had the passion and ability to make it happen, so I invested in them immediately after meeting them in 2014. Now they have grown to a company with over 100 employees.</p><p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> Mine would be Blocto. The cofounder Hsuan Lee was the former VP of Engineering for COBINHOOD, a company with lots of Taiwanese blockchain talents. AppWorks invested in Flow, and Flow wanted to find some Taiwanese blockchain talents to collaborate and build the Flow ecosystem into a better place. Hsuan Lee foresaw the potential and built a crypto wallet. With the experience from COBINHOOD, Blocto&#39;s crypto wallet is very user-friendly, and this is also the app I use every day.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/506/941/e40/506941e408c44445f703055d2d59cbffdb0680ba.jpg" alt="心元資本 Cherubic Ventures_鄭博仁 Matt Cheng (2)" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Cherubic&#39;s founding partner Matt Cheng is proud of investing in Calm. / Photograph : 心元資本</p><h2>Q. Tips for startups that are preparing to raise money?</h2><p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> Founders need to know why they want to raise money and what is the purpose of the money. Once founders get the investment money from VCs, they will demand a return, so founders need to make sure they have great ideas that will yield good returns. In addition, VCs are not all the same. Different VCs have different missions and provide different resources. Founders should do some research to make sure they are talking with the right VCs.</p><p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> Founders shouldn&rsquo;t wait until they need money to reach out to VCs. I met a lot of startups from Silicon Valley where no matter if you are interested in them or not, they would just keep sending you their company updates. By keeping in touch, VCs might start to get interested in you later on. Another tip is that I like to hear the disadvantages startups have. If they know their disadvantages, they can be careful about it and have more chances to succeed.</p><h2>Q. There are some situations where popular startups get lots of potential investors. How do you win favor from startups and get the chance to invest in them?</h2><p><strong>Joseph Huang:</strong> Our advantage lies in our expertise and understanding of the Japanese market, so I will say to the founders that we are the best choice for you if you want to get into the Japanese market.</p><p><strong>Matt Cheng:</strong> Because we focus on investing in early-stage startups, we are a founder-friendly VC. We will help founders grow, supporting them every step of the way, and because we have a strong network of founders across the world, we can help connect them to different founder communities and markets.</p><p><strong>Jamie Lin:</strong> AppWorks has an accelerator, fund, and school, so these three pillars enable us to form a strong startup community. For example, when we invested in Flow, they told us they wanted to participate in our community and find the talents and resources they needed which we were able to provide.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47580">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47580</a></p>', '61d/f89/f5e/61df89f5e5f18940137973.png', 1, '2022-01-13 02:12:04', '2024-09-01 21:16:10', null);

<p>In recent years, the Taiwan government has introduced a new visa for foreign entrepreneurs in an effort to bring more investment in the country. The Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa is an attractive option for foreign investors for several reasons, such as:
	<br>(1) It allows them one year to set up a business after arriving in Taiwan, meaning you don’t have to set up the business beforehand.
	<br>(2) You will receive an initial 1-year residency with multiple entries.
	<br>(3) If your business is successful, you may extend your Taiwan Entrepreneur Visa.
	<br>(4) Up to three team members can apply together.</p>

<p>As Taiwan gradually recognizes the importance of globalization, many companies are actively expanding abroad and hiring foreign employees.</p>

<p>This video summarizes the important guidelines to common questions that Taiwanese employers or foreign employees have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Taiwanese employer:
		<br>1. Does my company qualify to hire a foreigner?
		<br>2. Is there a minimum salary?</li>
	<li>Foreign employee:
		<br>1. What are the requirements to become an employee in Taiwan?

<p>The Taiwan Employment Gold Card is part of the Act for the Recruitment of Foreign Professionals, which was implemented in February 2018. It is part of a wider government initiative to attract more highly-skilled foreign talent to Taiwan.</p>

<p>The card is promoted as a ‘4-in-1’ and comprises an open work permit, resident visa, ARC, and multiple entry permit, which is everything that a non-citizen would require to legally live and work in Taiwan without requiring employee sponsorship.</p>

<p>The Taiwan government has identified several key areas which are deemed of importance to the economy, under which qualified foreigners can apply for the Gold Card: Science &amp; Technology, Economy, Finance, Education, Culture &amp; Arts, Sports, Law, and Architectural Design. Each category has its own set of specific requirements or qualifications under which applicants are assessed, with the assessments carried out by the corresponding government agencies or departments during the application process.</p>

So let’s take a step back to a time before social media, before smart phones, and even before Wi-Fi…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time, I shared my reactions to the recent metaverse hoopla and my hopes for the future of the medium after finishing Sarah Pinsker’s A Song for a New Day and watching Justin Bieber’s #BieberWAVE virtual concert in quick succession. I hope you did your homework and checked out both. Before I dig in (in this article the the ones following) I want to be clear about the scope of this discussion.</p>

<p>First off, there are a couple of things about A Song for a New Day that make it so relevant, which is why I’ll keep referring back to it.</p>

<ul>
	<li>

		<p>For one, the characters are living in a post-pandemic world, with some widespread terrorism added as a complicating factor. I was struck by how closely Pinsker’s world matches our current circumstances, right down to the talk about finding “a new normal,” which has been a guiding principle in my investments since the beginning of this thing. Had I read the book when it was first published in 2019, I might not have been convinced that elaborate virtual worlds could go mainstream this decade, but 2 years of nonstop Zoom meetings and event cancellations have given me a different perspective.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>Also, despite the book’s ode to traditional live music and critique of the mainstream entertainment industry, I couldn’t help wondering if Pinsker has also been a VC in a past life. The pain points she lays out echo the exact same doubts I have about the feasibility of every metaverse-related project I’ve been pitched or have read about in the media. In the chapter “Little Boxes,” for example, Pinsker describes in vivid detail the kinds of technical and human-generated obstacles that startup founders gloss over in pitch decks, to the frustration of VCs everywhere.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These two points considered, as a VC myself who’s fascinated by how technology expands and shapes what we consider entertainment, I want to add that I’m more optimistic than Pinsker about the promise of metaverse entertainment — while still acknowledging the potential downsides. And I believe that we in venture capital have both the resources and responsibility to anticipate these downsides and invest accordingly. Luckily, the “metaverse” most people are envisioning is still a long way off, at least for mainstream audiences, which means there’s still time to build it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Secondly, while we’re on the subject of the long-term future, I will refrain from getting into the inevitable revolution in consumer wearables that’ll transport us to the futuristic, fully immersive metaverse of science fiction. Immersive hardware has got to become as affordable, comfortable, and multifunctional as mobile phones while also providing a 1000% better experience — along the lines of the Hoodie™ Pinsker describes in A Song for a New Day. While we wait for hardware breakthroughs, the nascent metaverse is still going to be experienced by casual users through the devices we’ve already got, namely: phones, tablets, and desktops.</p>

<p>…Then again, judging by the fact that <a href="https://qz.com/2107700/metas-oculus-was-the-top-app-in-the-us-on-christmas/">Oculus rocketed to #1 in the app stores for both iOS and Android over Christmas</a> and how <a href="https://uploadvr.com/vr-player-sales-numbers-christmas-2021/">VR developers were celebrating spikes</a> as well, consumers are finally starting to believe <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/12/31/no-one-could-buy-a-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-this-christmas-so-they-bought-oculus-quest-2-vr-headsets/">VR headsets are viable alternatives to consoles like the Xbox Series X or the PS5.</a> Yet another example of how COVID-19 and its supply chain disruptions are changing our habits in unexpected ways.</p>

</p>

<p>I’m also not gonna focus on the “enterprise metaverse” technology that Microsoft and the Corporation Formerly Known as Facebook want to bring to your office. Let them duke it out for huge clients whose employees will still gripe about how <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/21/the-metaverse-will-make-your-meetings-worse/">the latest metaverse meeting could have been an email.</a> As an early stage investor, I’m much more interested in the layer of purpose-built metaverse software tools that the heavyweights will neglect to build, leaving huge niches like entertainment open for forward-thinking startups.</p>

<p>But while many VCs like me are old enough to remember the internet before modern SaaS, a lot of enthusiastic entrepreneurs out there are younger than the World Wide Web itself (<a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-the-world-wide-web">which turned 30 just before the pandemic, by the way</a>). That means that the folks who’re really going to shape our virtual future may not have suffered through all the annoying growing pains (and therefore opportunities) that come with a technological shift like the one before us. So let’s take a step back to a time before social media, before smart phones, and even before Wi-Fi…</p>

<p>Ok, so not quite all the way back to 1912, but back to the early days of the web, before WYSIWYG page builders and payment gateways went mainstream. Anyone trying to build a reputation on the Internet (as it was known before we all got tired of capitalizing the “I”) mostly had to outsource their web presences. If you had neither the budget to hire a webmaster nor the bandwidth to build your own tech expertise, you got left out until good DIY tools came along. Heck, even Blogger and LiveJournal didn’t start until 1999, so it was hard to build online audiences if you weren’t active on listservs or IRC. And if you did have a mid-90s web presence, you couldn’t exactly do SEO because there weren’t really any SEs to O yet. (You could eventually, however, submit your link to “<a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1381316068468162560?s=20">Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web.</a>”)</p>

<p>Here in 2022, as long as you’ve got something special to offer (be it a music album, podcast, novel, physical good, or service) you don’t need to know even a lick of HTML to have a robust brand online. Build a <strong>Squarespace</strong> website as your home base. Design your cover art and online ads with <strong>Canva</strong>. Amass a paying audience for your ongoing work via Patreon, sell your finished work on platforms like <strong>Pinkoi</strong> or <strong>Steam</strong>, pre-sell your new release on <strong>Kickstarter</strong>, or get revenue from ads on your <strong>YouTube</strong> vids, and do it all without even leaving the house.</p>

<p>Of course, you need a device with a stable internet connection, some starting capital, and a lot of time and patience, and not everyone has all of these things. However, for those who do, the technical barriers to reaching an audience for your work have largely been toppled. You still have to have talent at whatever it is you do or make, but you don’t have to be (or hire) a full stack developer AND a full stack marketer just to be able to compete.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the parallels between the 1990s and the 2020s are becoming clearer here, and entrepreneurs who are pumped up about the possibilities of the metaverse are starting to take a step back and look at the landscape. While others are still busy figuring out better ways to mint NFTs or transposing existing websites and apps into VR without adding much value, what can you be building that really matters? What MetaSaaS tools can you build for musicians, educators, influencers, or SMEs so they won’t need a small fortune or an engineering team to be part of metaverse culture as it matures?</p>

	<p>Worca, which provides integrated HR solutions for the US tech companies to hire remote engineering talents efficiently, has closed USD$ 1.5M seed fund. The investors include Mucker Capital, Hyphen Capital, and Gaingels. The fund will help Worca to accelerate the expansion of Asia-Pacific region.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worca is formerly known as <a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47407">MVP fastlance’s engineers recruiting business.</a> But during the Covid-19 pandemic, the co-founders Ti-Wen Lin and Jack Wu noticed that there was a strong need for recruiting remote engineering talents for the US’s tech companies. “The tech companies come for help to find engineers just skyrocketed. Noticing this strong demand, Jack and I spilled talent recruiting business off from MVP Fastlane and established Worca immediately,” said Ti-Wen, co-founder and CEO of Worca.</p>

<p>“Taiwan\'s talent is exceptional. We are the few headhunters that could bridge demand from US-based tech companies and the talent supply from Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam" said Jack Wu, co-founder and COO at Worca.</p>

<h2>Worca platform helps you hire global talents effortlessly</h2>

<p>In the post-covid era, working environments have changed tremendously. Companies started to hire more and more remote workers, and some even work from other countries. To catch up with the trend, Worca developed a SaaS one-stop destination platform to facilitate rapid hiring and onboarding of top talent, along with seamless integration of payroll, legal compliance, benefits, and other human resources functions.</p>

<p>Worca’s SaaS platform features automated HR processes that enable clients to staff up with elite engineers and other tech professionals who will ensure that their businesses can successfully launch, grow and thrive. Its streamlined process lets clients build a global team at a speed with retention rates as high as 96%.</p>

<p>For example, Worca recently helped a large U.S. tech company build a sizable product team in Taiwan in advance of an IPO. The company was working with a tight budget and strict timeline.</p>

<p>Worca’s team of experts quickly reached out to its network of recent and soon-to-be engineering graduates from top schools as well as experienced engineers looking for professional advancement or a change of scenery. Worca was able to hire 10 engineers per month on average and help to built a team of over 100 new hires.</p>

<p>Ti-Wen coined a unique strategy, Network Effect, which connects the elite talent and startups together. It shows that during the COVID-19, cross-border workers are still in high demand and Worca plays an important role to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>“We were pleased to support businesses in building capable and successful teams using our automated global talent management platform,” said Ti-Wen. “When they need to grow further, our easily scalable solutions help match them with the right talent for their next phase.”</p>

<p>While planning its expansion into Southeast Asia, South America and Europe, Worca will maintain its original primary recruiting base in Taiwan. They aim to be the largest recruiting platform in the Greater Southeast Asia region.</p>

	<p>Taiwan is a hidden gem in Asia: It\'s a beautiful, safe and welcoming country to live in, and surveyed expats report being incredibly satisfied with their quality of life . However, for those foreigners who wish to start and grow a successful career here, it can be quite challenging. There are approaches you can take to make the roadblocks easier to bypass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The topic of working in Taiwan as a foreigner is something I\'ve spoken about on multiple occasions. I\'ve had the pleasure of speaking at events discussing this issue hosted by All Hands Taiwan, The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, TAITRA and at a couple of job fairs. Within the foreigner community in Taiwan, this is the pervasive question: what are my options here professionally? I chose the sub-title of my article, not to suggest foreigners here are rough, but to allude to the difficult truth about living here as a foreigner: life in Taiwan is fantastic but the job prospects are not great. You have to accept the rough with the smooth.</p>

<h2>What do the statistics say?</h2>

<p>At the end of 2019, there were <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141478/141380/209124/">785,341 foreigners living in Taiwan</a>, 363,323 males and 423,018 females. Around 92% are from South East Asia and around 14,000 are from the larger English-speaking countries. The Ministry of Labor categorizes foreign workers into two major groups; Productive and Social Welfare and Special Professions or Technical Assignments. These categorizations are traditionally what is known as blue-collar and white-collar. The blue-collar labor market has 719,487 people working in mostly manufacturing and domestic nursing. Within the white-collar demographic, <a href="https://statdb.mol.gov.tw/html/mon/i0120020620e.htm">here</a> are some of the noteworthy statistics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>5,084 in Education (4,367 of these people are cram school teachers)</li>
	<li>19,929 in Specialized Technical Work (mostly engineers)</li>
	<li>1,266 in Accommodation and Food Services</li>
	<li>1,712 in Arts and Entertainment</li>
	<li>3,118 Directors of Foreign Businesses (Country Managers, Taiwan GM)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of this article, I will focus on what could be considered white-collar labor, as my own expertise regarding the blue-collar labor market here in Taiwan is limited. Unfortunately, I lack direct connections to these workers, companies, or working environments. My job focuses on recruiting mid-to-senior level white-collar talent in Taipei, and so this is the area I am most qualified to discuss.</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>The reason I\'ve been asked to give presentations about this topic is that I work as a headhunter in Taiwan for a company called Paul Wright Group.</p>

<p>An important part of my job is being hyper-aware of the labor market and hiring trends in Taiwan. It wouldn\'t be an exaggeration to say that internal human resource teams often rely on the market information that headhunters share with them. We trade in gossip and data. Effective and experienced headhunters will be experts on the job market they work within. I\'m also a foreigner, a young Scottish gentleman to be precise. As one of the few foreign recruiters in the market, I attract a lot of attention from foreigners seeking advice about the job market. I\'d say on average I speak to two or three different foreigners a week about their careers. These candidates all have unique professional backgrounds and the advice I give them depends heavily upon their individual situations. I want to talk a little about the different categories of jobs typical to Taiwan.</p>

<h2>The Education Industry</h2>

<p>For those professionals who have chosen education as their career, Taiwan has a lot of opportunities. There are thousands of kindergarten and cram school jobs available, as well as prestigious international schools for the more accredited teachers. There is a myriad of ways to pursue a career in education, be that teaching, opening your own school, coaching, editing textbooks, etc. I personally found teaching to be a difficult yet rewarding job and a lot of my friends here are in the industry. My take on it would be quite straightforward: if you enjoy working in this industry and feel challenged and fairly compensated, that’s great!</p>

<p>I would however add that the majority of frustrated professionals I encounter here are teachers whose hearts aren\'t in it. I was in this category once myself. I taught English in Taiwan for four years before deciding to move to Shanghai with the intention of getting into something new. The gamble paid off and I’ve been working in the headhunting industry for seven years now. For foreigners who wish to transition from a teaching position into another industry, the battle is an uphill one. I’ll attempt to tackle the question, "So what can I do to achieve this step?", a bit later on in the article. But first I want to distinguish between people in this situation seeking advice, and the expats who are at the very top of the pyramid.</p>

<h2>Expat Contracts</h2>

<p>Expat contracts, as they are known in the industry, are given to foreign professionals who have been sent to work in the Taiwan branch office. This group of talent is sourced from headquarters and is usually very globally mobile throughout their careers. The expat General Managers of multinational businesses here are on a vastly different level from the average worker. Expat contracts include things such as rent, a driver, children\'s private education, flights home and massive salaries. The total cost of these people to the companies who hire them is often astronomical compared to the average worker.</p>

<p>For this group of foreign professionals, there is not much I need to tell you. If you are being paid massive amounts of money to work in Taiwan and your contract runs out, finding a similar job here as a local hire is virtually impossible. For local hires, i.e. foreigners who already live in Taiwan who are applying for jobs here, we need to play the game alongside our Taiwanese colleagues. In most cases, local hire foreigners who work in the business are paid no more or no less than their Taiwanese colleagues. Unlike in the teaching industry, their foreignness doesn\'t entitle them to preferential treatment (and quite right!).</p>

<h2>But why is the job market so difficult for foreigners in Taiwan?</h2>

<p>Before advicing foreign professionals who wish to stay and build a career in Taiwan, I want to tackle the fundamental question at the core of the issue. Why is the job market in Taiwan limited and challenging for immigrants? This question is more than a little difficult to answer and I think taking it on as an MBA thesis topic would be an interesting endeavor (tempting!). The answer I most commonly give in private discussions is one that I\'m guessing will attract a degree of controversy. I think that one of the major reasons why there aren\'t a plethora of opportunities for foreigners in the professional market here is that Taiwan\'s history doesn\'t include large periods of European colonization. Major cities throughout the world, after undergoing long (and often brutal) periods of European rule, usually became more international and cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>Places like Hong Kong and Shanghai grew to accept foreign businesses and businessmen as the norm. During the period of modernization in Taiwan however, the market was not heavily influenced by Western companies and people. Taiwan remains a largely homogenous society (the exception being the aboriginal community, whose own history and relationship with colonists is not without brutality and suffering). The effect is that Taiwanese businesses are mostly localized, they don’t have a history of hiring many foreign white-collar workers. Change is a slow process, and the reality is that the majority of businesses here have little experience hiring foreign professionals.</p>

<p>The current situation in the job market is that when given a choice between hiring a local who speaks English or a foreigner who speaks Chinese, the former wins almost every time. As an example, a large Taiwanese company that sells its products globally will have a workforce composed almost solely of Taiwanese employees. If this Taiwanese company is selling into the Russian market, they\'ll hire a Taiwanese person who speaks either Russian or just English to work in their sales team. It could be argued this is nonsensical - surely a marketing professional from Brazil is going to be more effective at marketing a product in Brazil than a Taiwanese local who has been randomly assigned that territory. However, this is not the norm in Taiwanese companies.</p>

<p>Foreign businesses in Taiwan are sometimes even more localized, with 99% of the staff being Taiwanese. These multinationals would seem like a good place to start as a foreign professional looking to work in Taiwan. For instance, if you are from France, you might think that French companies such as L’Oréal, Pernod Ricard, Air Liquide and Chanel might hire you to work in their Taiwan office. It is definitely possible, and I won’t discourage anyone from trying. However, these companies are overwhelmingly localized for justifiable reasons, it makes sense to hire Taiwanese people to focus on their local market, where their native language and cultural understanding will help them make their employer financially successful. For example, L’Oréal hiring a French candidate to work in mid-level sales, marketing or supply chain is very uncommon. The only notable exception I’ve witnessed is global management trainee programs or brand ambassadors in the alcohol industry.</p>

<p>It also isn’t a question of salary cost or working visa as I often hear. If you bring up the topic of this article to a Taiwanese professional, they will most often guess that companies are reluctant to pay higher salaries for foreigners or that the working visa is difficult to apply for. I don\'t think either of these excuses is correct, the minimum salary for a working visa (ARC) is 47,971 NTD per month which is at the very bottom end of the salary spectrum for professional jobs in Taiwan. Even junior-level employees can make between 60-90k per month. The working visa or ARC permit is also not difficult for companies to apply for and costs them only a small expense. Taiwan\'s working visa stipulations are very reasonable compared to many other countries.</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p>After understanding the <a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47418">situations foreigners would meet</a> when working or seeking jobs in Taiwan, the author provides some observations and suggestions for foreign talents.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>So, what is the solution?</h2>

	<p>As with most complex problems, there are many things to consider when looking for answers. On a macro level, there are people and organizations slowly improving the situation for foreign professionals in Taiwan. Groups like All Hands Taiwan, the various Chambers of Commerce, Taipei City Mayor’s Office, and Crossroads are pulling things in a positive direction. The amount of lobbying that takes place in Taiwan on behalf of the foreign community is impressive. The situation is improving slowly thanks to these types of influencers and organizations. There is also the factor of learning from successful examples. If a company hires a foreigner and they perform well, they are more likely to hire other foreigners in an attempt to replicate the success. This growth is hopefully exponential. Performing well in a management job here helps all of your fellow foreigners in the long run.</p>

	<p>On an individual basis, there are many things you can do to improve your chances of getting a good job and building a successful career. Learning Chinese is probably a good idea in general for improving employability and quality of life. Networking is also a very good idea; knowing the right people can certainly open doors and guanxi remains an important force in the professional world. Studying something new and adding qualifications to your resume doesn’t hurt; things like coding courses, Google Analytics certificates or even a full MBA. If your resume is lacking in relevant work experience for the career you want, then adding anything to it will do you favors. Doing an internship or part-time project in your relevant field could make a world of difference. If you are a writer or artist, then focus on building a portfolio.</p>

	<p>Acting and dressing professionally would also be advisable. If your haircut, jewelry and general attire aren’t super appropriate for a professional setting, then you are only making things difficult for yourself. Cut off those festival bracelets, take out the earring and buy a nice suit (these are actually all real examples from my past).</p>

	<p>Of course, none of the suggestions above are unique to the situation in Taiwan – the same advice would be relevant to any job seeker. So let’s get a bit more specific: what are the particular things that make you more employable in Taiwan? I’ll share a story from an American Marketing Director friend of mine who managed a team of Taiwanese and a team of foreigners in her company. She told me that decisions were made at the management level and then she would delegate roles for her two teams. The Taiwanese team would listen, write notes and then get on with it. The foreign team would listen, give their opinion and then argue about the strategy chosen by the higher-ups. My friend found this extremely frustrating and became reluctant to hire any foreigners who seemed to be too opinionated and individualistic.</p>

	<p>The relevance of this story is that you shouldn’t expect to change Taiwanese working culture. If your behavior and attitude are too alien for the local Taiwanese colleagues to deal with, you won’t last long in a company here and certainly won’t be getting promoted any time soon. The best examples of successful foreign professionals I’ve seen are the people who adapt and understand the local culture. More specifically, this means understanding how to communicate a disagreement and how to speak with a Taiwanese boss. The subtleties are interesting and varied but ultimately you want to be considered an insider without losing the advantages of the outsider.</p>

	<h2>Job hunting strategies</h2>

	<p>Ultimately, the best way to approach looking for a job is using a combination of perseverance and creativity. I’ve covered the reasons why companies don’t often hire foreign talent, now it is your job to persuade someone why they should. Perseverance is paramount because often you’ll need to apply for lots of jobs, interview many times and work hard to improve your professional profile. Enduring failure and rejection will no doubt be a challenging and frustrating part of your job search. If you can overcome the defeatism that comes with rejection, you can slowly climb towards your goal and learn something from every setback.</p>

	<p>Creativity in a job search refers to the ability of a person to try every option and think outside the box. For example, have you thoroughly covered all of these options:</p>

	<p>1) Applied for jobs on LinkedIn and 104.com.tw</p>

	<p>2) Used your current network to its fullest</p>

	<p>3) Taken the time to build a new network of contacts through LinkedIn and events</p>

	<p>4) Spent the time to craft an attractive resume and LinkedIn profile</p>

	<p>5) Researched which companies hire foreigners</p>

	<p>The fifth point on the list above is usually the advice I give my foreign connections that they hadn’t previously thought of. If you’re going to look for opportunities in Taiwan, it makes sense to look for companies with a history of hiring foreign professionals. You can use LinkedIn and Google to do some market research; which companies currently employ foreigners and in what capacities? It makes sense that these firms will be easier to persuade to hire you. I previously worked for a large business in China where I was the first foreign hire. It was great fun, but it was a new experience for everyone involved and as a result lacked structure.</p>

	<p>Another angle might be to look into the start-up market. If you speak to experts within the start-up community here in Taipei, they will share the same prognosis of the market: lots of great ideas but a significant lack of business acumen, sales, and marketing ability. If this sounds like a great opportunity for you personally, then you are starting to get the picture. Look for opportunities everywhere, around every corner. For a confident but inexperienced foreigner, a partnership with a start-up venture might be the right move. The start-up can use your natural sales acumen and creativity and you can have the advantage of being given a chance to shine. These kinds of jobs will probably not pay well initially, but your priority should be getting a foot in the door and earning relevant experience.</p>

	<h2>Growing your career in Taiwan</h2>

	<p>If you are already on the career ladder in Taiwan and have more than a couple of years’ experience already, then perhaps I haven’t tackled your circumstances adequately enough. For this group of people, the real question is how do you build a solid and improving career here over several years? I’m actually going to tackle this question in more detail in a future article, so I won’t go into too much depth here. However, I’d still refer back to a previous point regarding compromising with the Taiwanese working culture. Over years this only becomes more relevant. Being promoted and given more responsibility within a company also means an increased need to communicate amicably within a hierarchy. The better you are at communicating with your boss, colleagues and subordinates, the higher you will climb in the business.</p>

	<p>If you work for a company where the Taiwanese staff vastly outnumber the foreign staff, cooperating well with your local colleagues and having them see you as an asset to the company can be the most obvious key to achievement. If you can find ways to exploit your differences and strengths, it will most likely be recognized internally. Find yourself allies within the business to help you with the harder tasks and work hard to prove your worth.</p>

	<h2>Is the market changing for the better?</h2>

	<p>It is quite clear that the current labor market for foreigners is a bit intimidating, which brings me to an important question: is the market changing for the better? If I had to speculate, I’d say the situation is improving for white-collar foreign labor. I personally would love to see more diversity in companies here. I’m a big believer in the advantages of a mixed workforce, hiring a variety of personalities and skills allows a company to utilize different employees for different needs. Having a charming and outgoing Sales Manager might be to your advantage while having your Finance and IT Heads to be more technically astute would make more sense. I’d extend this to foreign talent. For example, having a marketing team comprised of ten locals and one foreigner would allow a company to get a non-Taiwanese perspective on the ideas and strategies being discussed. A diverse workforce improves a business.</p>

	<p>The government is also attempting to attract foreign talent to the island. There is a labor shortage in a number of <a href="https://sentinel.tw/china-foreign-workers-taiwan/">technical professions</a> and the birth rate in Taiwan is amongst the <a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/201903250013">lowest in the world</a>. Having said that, intentions don’t always translate into measurable results and improvements could definitely be made. Recent measures such as the introduction of the <a href="https://allhandstaiwan.com/2019/07/29/what-is-the-taiwan-employment-gold-card/">Gold Card program</a>, setting up Contact Taiwan, and a general willingness by the government to engage in discussion with the influential individuals within the foreign business community. Some rumors working visa stipulations will be lowered by the end of 2020. The restrictions around minimum wage, two years of experience, and holding a bachelor’s degree are all being <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/04/21/2003669125">considered and reviewed</a>.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, any change will be slow and gradual. Successful examples of foreigners working here will lead to more companies taking a chance on hiring foreign talent. The best changes I’ve witnessed recently have been the result of efforts by a few close friends of mine. Daniel Miller runs a company called Pagoda Projects that partners with Universities from the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in placing interns into companies in Taiwan. I think this is brilliant. Before this kind of semi-governmental project came into Taiwan, there were very few examples of foreigners being given a chance in entry-level roles. I can guarantee that companies who hire strong-performing interns will be more likely to start increasing their openness to hiring foreign talent. Crucially, it is a much less risky investment for the Taiwanese business to hire an intern for six months. Interns are a company’s gateway drug into the world of office place diversity.</p>

	<p>The next positive organization I’d like to mention by name is All Hands Taiwan. Before All Hands Taiwan came into being, you could feel the palpable frustration and anger emanating from the online job boards and discussion groups. On the Facebook group, “Non-Teaching Jobs in Taiwan” the comments under job postings were frequently confrontational and aggressive. The admins of the group work incredibly hard with their volunteered time and it was often repaid with ingratitude. I watched several comment threads get completely out of control. All Hands Taiwan aims to offer an alternative to this negativity, creating a community of events and discussions centered around collecting practical and actionable advice from people who know what they’re talking about. This has allowed the foreign community to grow and learn from each other’s experiences. I have high hopes for these kinds of efforts and will continue to do anything I can to support people like John Murn, who are combining good intentions with good ideas.</p>

	<h2>The foreigner\'s dilemma: To stay or to go?</h2>

	<p>The decision about whether to stay in Taiwan or move home is one that many people agonize over. Once you consider that you might not be able to have a successful career here, it makes sense to weigh your options. For some professionals, moving to Shanghai, Singapore, Bangkok or back home might be the best play. The market in Taiwan for foreigners is worse than in many major international cities. The decision will have to be considered alongside many factors and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Moving back to your native country might be the best option if you wish to have an easier career ladder. It makes sense that ambitious professionals are more likely to hit their full potential in their home market. However, if you’ve already lived overseas for many years, going back home and attempting to start in a new market might be comparably frustrating. I would recommend everyone to analyze their situation and consider all factors. I give individualized advice about this kind of decision on a regular basis if you want to contact me on LinkedIn.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Taiwan is a hidden gem in Asia: It’s a beautiful, safe and welcoming country to live in, and surveyed expats report being incredibly satisfied with their quality of life. However, for those foreigners who wish to start and grow a successful career here, it can be quite challenging. There are approaches you can take to make the roadblocks easier to bypass, and the market is potentially changing for the better and becoming more open. However, this progress will probably be slow. The path you choose and the decisions you make about your career will ultimately need to be determined by your own individual situation. Maybe with some tips from a headhunter ;)</p>

We look forward to helping more tutors maximize their earning potential and continuing to improve the online learning experience for all our users.&quot;</p><p>AmazingTalker plans to use the latest investment to grow its business in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, Europe, and North America.

He aimed at joining Japans&rsquo; boxing contest. To achieve his dream, he worked as a salesperson for a famous English learning platform with a high salary. Finally, he accumulated enough money to go to Japan to pursue his boxing career. Unfortunately, he got injured and had to give up his dream.</p><div data-aid="47603"><p>He returned to Taiwan, where he decided to rejoin the business he was most familiar with: the language learning business.</p><p>&ldquo;There are many choices for language learning students, and every platform is dedicated to providing the best services for students. But I decided to launch a platform that provides tutors the best services,&rdquo; said Abner.</p><p>In 2017, Abner launched AmazingTalker. To encourage tutors to spend more time teaching classes and improving their teaching quality, AmazingTalker would decrease the platform&rsquo;s host fee as tutors spent more time on the platform. For example, a tutor might have no platform fee once he earns over $3,000 USD per month. At this point, he would only need to pay the 8% handling fee.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s core value is to maximize tutors&rsquo; earning potential by setting their fees independently.</p><p>Besides the special commission system that drives tutors to keep improving their teaching quality, AmazingTalker generates insights through data analysis of user behavior to help tutors continuously improve the quality of their teaching services. This enables AmazingTalker to use algorithms to match students and tutors precisely and efficiently within a few seconds.</p><p>AmazingTalker also provides an interactive learning environment that supports independence for both teachers and learners. Students can communicate their needs directly with prospective tutors without a binding contract or long-term payment obligation.</p><p>The global appetite for learning continues to grow. According to UNESCO, 470 million people will seek higher education over the next 15 years, a figure that far outstretches university capacity and that underscores the need for alternative learning sources. By 2026, the total global e-learning market is set to nearly double its 2019 level, landing at an astronomical $400 billion according to Statista.</p><p>With the current stellar growth trajectory, the Taiwan-based AmazingTalker website aims at expanding their global business further.</p></div><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47603">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47603</a></p>', '621/ed0/ae7/621ed0ae7ed77540358588.jpg', 1, '2022-03-02 02:06:06', '2024-09-01 21:14:44', null);

	<p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare reduced the quarantine period from 14 days to 10 days, and borders were opened to business travelers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mandatory quarantine for overseas arrivals was shortened to 10 days on Monday (March 7), and borders were opened to business travelers.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare reduced this period from 14 days, and quarantines are still followed by seven days of self-health monitoring. Foreigners can now apply for special entry permits for business-related activities, such as investment and execution of business contracts.</p>

<h2>Business travelers</h2>

<p>Foreign professionals who can now apply for business visas include workers recruited by Taiwanese companies, managers of foreign or overseas Taiwan-invested companies, teachers hired by cram schools, athletes, coaches, and entertainers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipulates that foreigners in these categories must first apply for a special entry permit at a Taiwanese representative office overseas.</p>

<p>Businesspeople from China, Hong Kong, and Macau may apply for entry upon invitation by organizations in Taiwan for the purpose of executing business contracts or for internal transfers within multinational corporations. People from Hong Kong and Macau can apply through Taiwan\'s representative offices in those territories, while business travelers from other parts of China must have the Taiwanese organization inviting them apply through the National Immigration Agency\'s online platform on their behalf.</p>

<h2>10-day home quarantine</h2>

<p>Under the new "10 plus 7" quarantine scheme, two PCR tests and four rapid antigen tests will be required. Arrivals now have the option of spending their entire 10-day quarantine at home, but they must be able to maintain the principle of "one person per household" at their residence or a relative or friend\'s.</p>

<p>Arrivals must first undergo a PCR test upon arrival in Taiwan and another one on the 10th day of quarantine. They must also take rapid antigen tests on the third, fifth, and seventh day of quarantine as well as on the third and either sixth or seventh day of self-health monitoring.</p>

<p>The Central Epidemic Command Center\'s (CECC) definition of "one household" is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>

		<p>Independent home address</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>Independent external entrance and exit that do not connect with a living area shared by non-quarantining persons</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<p>During the quarantine period, non-quarantining persons do not enter the home.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Those who are unable to meet these requirements must undergo quarantine in an epidemic prevention hotel or quarantine center.</p>

<h2>10-day quarantine for COVID contacts</h2>

<p>People who are listed as a contact of a confirmed COVID case will now also only need to quarantine for 10 days. They must test for COVID on the first and last day of their quarantine.</p>

<p>They must also take a rapid antigen test between the fifth and seventh day of quarantine, as well as one at the end of the self-health monitoring period. If they develop symptoms during quarantine, they must take an additional PCR test.</p>

<p>Like arrivals from overseas, contacts of COVID cases can undergo quarantine at home. However, they must follow the principle of "one person per room," meaning that they can prove to the CECC that they are not sharing a room or bathroom with anyone in the same home.</p>

Despite the success of its first product launch, Han quickly realized <strong>he needed to pivot his business to software solutions if he wanted Lucid to survive in the fiercely competitive startup environment.</strong></p><p>Earlier this month, we got to sit down with Han to talk about the opportunities and challenges he faced to build a startup from the ground up and how he pivoted from hardware to software while remaining true to his vision.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ff8/d86/7c1/ff8d867c182c7181351cdf6f5a365c3daef5607d.jpg" alt="Lucid X Meet Global_2022-03-01_侯俊偉攝影_ (4)" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>LucidCam, the first VR180 3D camera for consumers. / Photograph: Meet</p><h2>Turning his startup dream into reality and earning a coveted spot on &lsquo;Forbes 30 Under 30&rsquo;</h2><p>Han&rsquo;s dream of having his own startup came to him when he was studying towards a Masters degree in Engineering at UC Berkeley. &ldquo;Being a student there, you got the opportunity to hear from a lot of entrepreneurs, founders and success stories. It was a very supportive and inspiring environment where you&rsquo;d have moments where you catch yourself thinking: &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t I be the next big thing?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>With his degree he went into product management and operations in technology and went on to work at flash memory manufacturer Sandisk for 3 years as a product manager in the cameras department. He was fascinated with camera technology so he started to think about how he could build a powerful camera, capable of creating immersive 3D experiences, the same way our eyes see the world.</p><p>But back then, cameras were not yet powerful enough to generate 3D content so when he founded Lucid in 2015, he first needed to build his own hardware that would have the level of processing power he required.</p><p>He was still based in the U.S. at that time when he heard about Garage+, a global incubator for startups in Taiwan, so he applied for its Global Startup Programme and came to Taiwan to seek out opportunities. He demoed at <a href="https://meettaipei.tw/">Meet Taipei</a>, the largest tech startup trade show in Asia, and started to form his industry connections with manufacturers in Taiwan which led him to getting his first investment for his startup.</p><p>By building strong connections and raising enough capital, Han launched LucidCam, the first VR180 3D camera for consumers, and shipped thousands of units to Amazon, Best Buy and other major retailers. This successful launch was even recognized by Forbes which featured him on its &lsquo;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/han-jin/?sh=48d96df21c05">30 Under 30</a>&rsquo; list under consumer technology.</p><h2>Setting up shop in Taiwan to build a strong software development team</h2><p>But a startup story isn&rsquo;t all sunshine and rainbows. Raising capital for a hardware startup is difficult as Han begins to explain why he needed to pivot his business into the software side of things.</p><p>&ldquo;Our first product was a great success but to build the next iteration of the camera, you will need to raise millions of dollars in capital again because you&rsquo;ve already spent all your funds building the first one. This investment cycle proved to be really demanding. So I started to think that maybe it was time to focus on software solutions because GPUs in every device such as our phones were becoming more and more powerful, so I didn&rsquo;t see the need of building my own hardware anymore. My company vision has always been the same &mdash; bringing people closer together by creating and sharing immersive viewing experiences &mdash; but we needed to adapt to find an economical and sustainable business model.&rdquo;</p><p>The traveling back and forth to Taiwan over the years took its toll on Han and he decided to set up an office in Taiwan in 2018. That&rsquo;s when he met Jonathan Liao at Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA), who is the founder of Futuerward and director of the Gold Card project, and suggested to Han to get a Gold Card Visa which has many benefits for foreign professionals.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/6d8/f3b/31e/6d8f3b31ed3239d6508a62d680b18d02f1d2b386.jpg" alt="Lucid X Meet Global_2022-03-01_侯俊偉攝影_ (3)" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Han Jin with Jonathan Liao, Project Director at the Taiwan Employment Gold Card Office / Photograph: Meet</p><p>What is it like to set up shop and run a startup in Taiwan? &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an advantage of building a strong and agile team in Taiwan because of the great talent here and that&rsquo;s what we did when we transitioned to software development,&rdquo; says Han.</p><p>One thing that Han pointed out about the talents here in Taiwan is that they excel in execution and implementation of projects. &ldquo;Areas like customization and customer engagement, Taiwanese are really good at it. Americans, on the other hand, I find do well in breakthrough research, sales and marketing. So we currently have a CTO based in the U.S who focuses on research.&rdquo;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/372/d9d/3ef/372d9d3ef5bb007852019c4ea292d1fb3b5016b7.jpg" alt="Lucid X Meet Global_2022-03-01_侯俊偉攝影_ (2)" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Han Jin talks about the highs and lows of his entrepreneurial journey / Photograph: Meet</p><h2>Overcoming the challenges of changing the business model and recruiting new talent</h2><p>However, when you pivot your business you can&rsquo;t assume your employees will all be onboard with the new direction. &ldquo;You need different talents when you go into software. Even though our company vision never changed, transitioning into a software business had its challenges because you just don&rsquo;t know how everyone on your team will feel about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Speaking of how he recruited new talent for software development, Han said: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re shifting your business, it&rsquo;s important to have new strategies on how to recruit new talent and know how to assess if they&#39;re the right people for the company.&rdquo;</p><p>Another major challenge Han faced was how to convince customers that you&rsquo;re good business and show investors your commitment. &ldquo;You have to be very clear about your business model. Shifting your business means you have to impress stakeholders by showing that you can learn about a new space more quickly than everyone else. And you have to emerge as an expert &mdash; being able to do that is hard because you have to make a lot of effort in order to learn faster and deeper than everyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&#39;t be fixated with just one direction,&rdquo; as Han continues to discuss the learning curve he went through. &ldquo;Look at Slack for example, when it decided to pivot that&rsquo;s when it took off.&rdquo; But even though being flexible is important in running a startup, Han also added that if you do decide to pivot or shift your business direction, you have to keep in mind that it needs to be well-reasoned. &ldquo;You need to back up your assessment and decisions with data and research to show you really know what you&#39;re doing and how you&rsquo;re moving your business in the right direction.&rdquo;</p><h2>The race is on to build the smartest AI brain in the industry</h2><p>By pivoting to software, Lucid is now a digital content platform that leverages AI to help businesses manage and scale videos.</p><p>Han gave us a demonstration of Lucid&rsquo;s AI system in his office in Taipei, showing how it can learn to recognize faces, actions and even speech in videos. By analyzing all the data presented in the video, the platform edits and finalizes different video clips for customers to choose from. &ldquo;Our AI can generate different topics for a user to choose from, for example, &lsquo;Conversational&rsquo;, &lsquo;Action&rsquo; or &lsquo;Romance&rsquo; and many other topics, and our platform can edit videos according to the chosen topic.&rdquo;</p><p>How does all of this help businesses? &ldquo;We consume content so fast now we have a content supply and demand mismatch in the market. So if you&rsquo;re an influencer or a business who needs to create videos on a regular basis, we can help you save time and cost on manual editing and help businesses keep up with the consumer demand,&rdquo; explains Han.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ca9/b77/3be/ca9b773be351ce70a90c03069e0469b1991aacea.jpg" alt="Lucid_Portal.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Lucid&#39;s portal interface / Photograph : Lucid</p><p>He goes on to mention how they&rsquo;re helping one of their customers, VEVO, who has hundreds of thousands of videos that need to be edited fast, and quickly uploaded across platforms. &ldquo;We work with them to edit and build engaging viewer experiences across their social media platforms. It&#39;s a very personalized and efficient editing service and because our AI can remember client preferences, the efficiency and the quality of our work will keep on improving as the client feeds more data into our AI.&rdquo;</p><p>To date, Lucid already has over 5 million customers worldwide using their services and products. As its AI becomes more intelligent from the huge amounts of data it processes every day from video content, the startup is also analyzing the collated data to build better AI solutions that are made specifically for different scenarios and applications.</p><p>&ldquo;We are now talking with many automation and manufacturing clients in Taiwan and training our AI to make sure it&rsquo;s adaptable and suitable across different industries and production sites,&rdquo; says Han.</p><p>Competing in a crowded market such as the AI industry is not easy, and Han believes the companies that can stand out from the crowd will be those who can build the most intelligent AI software. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the race to build the smartest AI brain in the industry and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming for.&rdquo;</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47635">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47635</a></p>', '623/2e5/6ce/6232e56cecb17250438033.jpg', 1, '2022-03-17 07:40:56', '2024-09-01 21:13:33', null);

Now after a successful seed round from Mynavi, one of the largest staffing firms in Japan, they are ready to take on an even bigger share of the market. &ldquo;We want to be the Asian equivalent of LinkedIn and become the largest social network for professionals in the APAC region.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re working in the tech industry in Taiwan, chances are you&rsquo;ve probably heard of CakeResume already. This fast-growing professional network not only helps job seekers build resumes, it also works with numerous tech companies such as Amazon Web Services, Google, MediaTek and TSMC to help them recruit tech talent.</p><p>Clearly, a lot has happened since we last interviewed Trantor Liu, founder and CEO of CakeResume, five years ago. From his early startup days as a one man band to now leading a 30+ team that helps millions of users worldwide, Trantor has come a long way since he founded CakeResume.

For Indonesia, we saw a high conversion rate of around 40%, so we saw an opportunity there and started investing in marketing and local influencer campaigns to build our online presence in the region. Now if you type in keywords such as &#39;CV maker&#39; in Indonesia, we will appear in the top 3 search results.&rdquo;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/811/e85/6f3/811e856f314dca61035a5f07d3fda102cdd6b322.jpg" alt="CakeResume 2.2million users.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>CakeResume has plans to build the largest tech talent pool in Asia / Photograph : CakeResume</p><p>Similar to the strategy of how they built up their talent pool in Taiwan, Trantor explains when it comes to international expansion, the first step remains the same which is to develop a big database of potential candidates. &ldquo;We will continue to invest and build up our talent pool in Indonesia because once you achieve enough users, businesses will come to you asking for help to recruit talent.&rdquo;</p><p>What is his end goal for expanding into APAC? &ldquo;After a successful seed round from Mynavi, we are even more ambitious now to take on a bigger share of the market.

He worked 18-hour days and to save time and money he <strong>even took care of all his meals at convenience stores every day for at least 6 months.</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Looking back on my journey, I feel very lucky that everything just came together for me.

Moreover, the global bicycle market reached US$59.3 billion in 2021 and predicts an 8.2% of annual growth rate over the next eight years, according to <a href="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/2022/03/bicycle-industry-production-challenges-record-growth/" target="_blank">Amcham Taiwan</a>. To switch to a greener and healthier lifestyle, more and more people opt for bicycles to commute.</p><p>Philip Corri, founder of Keego from Ireland, had observed these trends and found that: no one is actually producing e-bikes specifically for the food delivery industry. Keego was thus launched to fill the gap. As the food industry keeps growing at a skyrocketing rate, the startup is building e-bikes for food delivery to solve the pain point, said Elias.</p><p>In Taiwan, food delivery drivers mostly ride scooters, which is costly and harmful to the environment. According to the research of Keego, drivers who ride scooters on average spend 20% of their profits on gas, not including the cost of acquisition and maintenance. As for in Europe, drivers usually ride consumer bikes to deliver the food. It&rsquo;s because some metropolitans often have the problem of traffic congestion. Like in London, the average speed from one site to another is 8 km/h. But consumer bikes are not built for delivery, as they can&rsquo;t carry heavy loads and are not durable enough for long distances and long hours of working.</p><p>&ldquo;There are over 4 million food delivery drivers in Europe,&rdquo; said Elias, &ldquo;professional delivery bikes are in high demand.&rdquo; Keego offers a complete solution for delivery companies to be green and profitable. With a total load capacity of 65 kg, Keego&rsquo;s latest e-bike KG4 can reach a maximum speed of 25 km/h, and its battery capacity could support a 120 km-drive range.</p><h2>Based in Taiwan for two decades, Keego founder Philip and Elias team up to build e-bikes with IoT systems</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/f0e/c72/cbc/f0ec72cbc846048142e89f8feb5d146f97e4f932.jpg" alt="KG4 in Berlin" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Keego&#39;s team is experienced at producing well-integrated software and hardware, according to Elias. / Photograph : Keego</p><p>In 2001, both Elias and Philip worked in PaceBlade, a startup company in Taiwan which has introduced tablet PCs, 10 years before Apple came out iPad. Back then, the device acts as an LCD desktop, notebook, and tablet PC all in one, acquired by NASA and The International Space Station (ISS). The company had run for one year and a half and was sold to a Dutch company. The two pals had embarked on different paths in Taiwan.</p><p>Elias has launched Enspyre, a Telemarketing and Phone Answering services provider. Enspyre provides telemarketing services to large companies and phone answering services to small and medium-sized companies, which equips Elias with rich experiences in B2B business models. On the other hand, Philip has started several Taiwan-based startups, working on software and hardware integration and development.</p><p>In 2020, Philip wanted to start something new. He invited Elias to join the team. &ldquo;With 15 years of experience, Philip is well capable of building both software and hardware, which are well-integrated,&rdquo; said Elias, &ldquo;we have the mindset of creating products that are well suited to the market, and that&rsquo;s Keego&rsquo;s advantage to be the one that produces the smart e-bikes for food delivery.&rdquo;</p><p>The Keego KG4 delivery e-bike has a built-in IoT module that allows constant communication between the drivers and the manager. In Europe, food delivery drivers use vehicles appointed by companies instead of their own vehicles, as the drivers are turning into full-time employees. The drivers&rsquo; app and fleet manager portal are always connected. The drivers&rsquo; app also keeps track of data about current speed, battery power, GPS location, etc.</p><h2>Eying for the global market: food delivery e-bikes can adapt to different cultures</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/378/c73/079/378c730796e30c6712cf7c1b7f58edbd122bc101.jpg" alt="KG4 in Berlin" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>In Europe, food delivery companies are searching for professional e-bikes to build their own delivery fleet. / Photograph : Keego</p><p>&ldquo;We value what customers want, what the market wants,&rdquo; said Elias. Keego has run a lot of tests on streets as well as market surveys. It turns out that drivers in Taiwan are interested in getting a food delivery e-bike for themselves, as e-bikes are cheaper than scooters, eco-friendly, and easier to find a parking spot.</p><p>Keego customized its products according to the regions. For the Taiwanese market, the company sells its sturdy e-bikes for food delivery. As for European and U.S. markets, it will go for the in-built IoT e-bikes fleet. In Europe, contract drivers are turning into full-time employees due to law regulations. Delivery companies need to provide vehicles for the drivers, guaranteeing the delivery quality and the coordination.</p><div data-aid="47670"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/6f6/f84/615/6f6f84615130114451d073438f9773feb54fa418.jpg" alt="Keego" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><div data-aid="47670">Keego has run a lot of tests on streets as well as market surveys. / Photograph: Keego<br><br><p>Keego is actively expanding the global market of food delivery e-bikes.

	<p>COVID case contacts will be able to leave home isolation on 4th day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taiwan\'s Cabinet on Sunday (April 24) approved a new plan by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) that will enable contacts of COVID cases to leave home isolation on the fourth day if they test negative for the virus.</p>

<p>Cabinet Spokesman Lo Ping-cheng (羅秉成) announced that CECC officials had presented the details of a new plan to shorten home isolation for contacts of COVID cases to Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) earlier that day. Under the program, which has been dubbed "3+4," COVID case contacts must undergo home isolation for three days.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, the contacts must take a rapid antigen test, and if the result is negative they will be allowed to end their home isolation. However, they must then observe four days of self-health monitoring protocols, such as avoiding eating in restaurants, attending large events, and wearing a mask at all times in public.</p>

<p>Lo said that given that 99.5% of local cases since Jan. 1 have been mild or asymptomatic, and in order to maintain a normal life for the country\'s residents, the strategy has shifted to reserving quarantine facilities and medical resources for high-risk groups and those with moderate and severe symptoms. Lo reported that Su agreed in principle with the new shortened home isolation policy and the narrowed range for people listed as contacts.</p>

<p>Lo said that since the preparation of supporting facilities and related details require the cooperation of local governments, the CECC will consult with county and city officials on the new policy as soon as possible before setting up an implementation date.</p>

The GSER is the world’s most comprehensive, data-driven research on startups with 280+ entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems and 3 million startups analyzed. Agricultural technology, as a sub-sector, captures the use of technology in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture aimed at improving yield, efficiency, and profitability through information monitoring and analysis of weather, pests, soil, and air temperature. New Food employs innovation to optimize food design, creation, diversity, distribution, and utilization.</p>

<p>The Agtech &amp; New Food Edition explores technology-based startups with a focus on improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability – including drones, alternative proteins, vertical farming, waste management, and more, along with a ranking of the top Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems globally. Key highlights from the Agtech &amp; New Food Edition include:</p>

<p>● The top five Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems are Silicon Valley, New York City, London, Tel Aviv-Jerusalem, and Denver-Boulder.</p>

<p>● North America and Asia dominate the top 25 Agtech &amp; New Food ranking, with 48% and 20% respectively. Europe has four ecosystems in the top 25, Oceania has two, and MENA one.</p>

<p>● The amount of Series B+ deals in Agtech &amp; New Food worldwide rose from $3.8 million in 2017 to $11.5 million in 2021. North America accounted for 70% of Series B+ deals in 2021.</p>

<p>● Due to shifts in consumer behavior and rapid innovation in the sub-sector (including pandemic-driven changes), the share of food and grocery delivery deals has climbed steadily in recent years. In 2021, delivery accounted for 11% of the $1.6 billion invested in Agtech &amp; New Food, up from just 2% of total dollar amount invested in the sub-sector in 2017 and 6% in 2020.</p>

<p>● Startups that create vegan products (both food and other items) and non-cultivated meat alternatives overtook cultivated meat in terms of deal amount at the seed stage in 2021, suggesting increasing early-stage innovation in the meat alternative field.</p>

<p>“Agtech &amp; New Food is one of the most attractive sub-sectors given its strong growth and it offering much needed global solutions to food disparity as well as environmental and employment sustainability,” shares JF Gauthier, Founder &amp; CEO of Startup Genome.</p>

<p>Within the report, Agtech &amp; New Food ecosystems are ranked based on many weighted factors including: economic performance, concentration of startups, sub-sector strengths, engineering talent, and level and growth of early-stage funding. The report includes contributed articles from Agtech &amp; New Food experts such as Caroline Bushnell of The Good Food Institute and Amy Wu of From Farms to Incubators. The data powering the report is contributed from several sources including: Dealroom, Crunchbase, PitchBook, CB Insights, local partners, and Startup Genome’s proprietary data, which includes interviews with 100+ experts and 10,000+ survey participants annually.</p>

Its innovative approach is trusted mainly by automakers, data centers and the mobile communications industry.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/e15/1be/988/e151be988e694f74e311f609833699e2df599e33.jpg" alt="proteanTecs 共同創辦人" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Several co-founders of proteanTecs previously co-founded Mellanox, a supplier of computer networking products acquired by Nvidia for US$7 billion in 2019, which is by far the biggest deal carried out by Nvidia. / Photograph : proteanTecs</p><p>Several co-founders of proteanTecs previously co-founded Mellanox, a supplier of computer networking products acquired by Nvidia for US$7 billion in 2019, which is by far the biggest deal carried out by Nvidia. &ldquo;Our founders have long been in the electronics and semiconductor industry, therefore the connection of the field was already there,&rdquo; said Yuval Bonen, co-founder and VP of Software at proteanTecs.</p><p>Seasoned expertise and vast experience in the industry paved the way for a collaboration between proteanTecs and TSMC as well as MediaTek. proteanTecs was included in the catalog of the TSMC Silicon IP alliance, and was later awarded Partner of the Year in 2021, which recognizes TSMC&rsquo;s ecosystem partners&rsquo; pursuit of excellence. MediaTek foresaw proteanTecs technology&#39;s potential and decided to invest in it.</p><p>The collaboration between Taiwan and Israel has proven a mighty one. &ldquo;Israel has niche expertise, which complements Taiwan&rsquo;s robust and complete supply chain,&rdquo; said Bonen.</p><p>Currently, proteanTecs&rsquo; <a href="https://www.proteantecs.com/news/proteantecs-uct-supports-tsmc-3nm-process-technology-to-accelerate-lifecycle-health-monitoring" target="_blank">solutions support the latest 3-nm processes</a> by TSMC. On TSMC customers&rsquo; part, health and performance monitoring has proven to be beneficial. As leading foundries around the world compete for leading market position, more tailored and innovative services are critical to striking a difference between rivals.</p><h2>The eyes and ears of chips</h2><p>In this modern day, electronics are practically everywhere. From mobile phones, EVs to datacenters, chips are key components that make the world go around. However, chip health and performance monitoring is a challenge that most manufacturers are not ready to take on.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/technology/computer-chips-errors.html" target="_blank">research article</a> published by the New York Times, titled &ldquo;Tiny Chips, Big Headaches&rdquo;, illustrates the problem of hardware malfunction detection. &ldquo;As the tiny switches in computer chips have shrunk to the width of a few atoms, the reliability of chips has become another worry for the people who run the biggest networks in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Chip errors are even dubbed the &ldquo;Achilles heel&rdquo; of major semiconductor companies. Intel, Facebook and Google are all scratching their heads to come up with solutions to ensure hardware reliability.</p><p>proteanTecs&rsquo; technology is determined to tackle the problem. &ldquo;We provide visibility into the chips. Much like eyes and ears inside their electronics which help our customers monitor chip health and performance,&rdquo; said Bonen.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/7e1/d63/183/7e1d63183381f33b95f0257e60c46a4037bbf096.jpg" alt="Datacenter Predictive Maintenance" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>proteanTecs tech can be used to carry out predictive maintenance in data centers. / Photograph : proteantecs</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/eca/f7b/1a4/ecaf7b1a4956e562910c812f5a51dc87aab68f47.jpg" alt="proteanTecs 監測介面示意圖.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Data monitoring dashboard allows proteanTecs customers access to insights and also predict when the chip is likely to experience an error. / Photograph : proteanTecs</p><p>With data monitoring, proteanTecs are able to provide insights and also predict when the chip was likely to experience an error, and preempt possible breakdown. So-called &ldquo;agents&rdquo; are embedded into semiconductor chips, extracting data back to the cloud-based SaaS platform. Insights generated will then be critical value to customers.</p><p>The &ldquo;agent&rdquo; bestows visibility upon any given product life cycle. In the initial stages of chip assembly and design, production visibility and variability analysis allows for faster time to market and improved quality. Further down the supply chain, such technology can be applied in-field such as EV chip monitoring, which provides alerts on faults before failures. EV-owners are guaranteed a much safer riding experience with proteanTecs&rsquo; technology.</p><div data-aid="47684"><h2>Building Rome from day one</h2><p>The business proteanTecs is involved in is far from an intuitive one, as the entry barrier for this is extremely high. &ldquo;Our business consolidates a diverse array of talents, not a lot of companies can do that successfully,&rdquo; said Bonen. Cross-discipline collaboration on proteanTecs&rsquo; team, including chip designers, software engineers and data scientists, is what contributes to proteanTecs success.</p><p>proteanTecs has invented a unique approach, never seen before in the industry, building services holistically with data analysis and machine learning. Customers are thus able to see a red flag and understand impending failure in their devices. On the whole, proteanTecs solve problems that are not addressed today.</p><p>Currently, proteanTecs is expanding its presence around the globe. Specifically in the APAC region, where economic growth is robust. &ldquo;Taiwan is the growth engine of APAC. We set up offices here in order to tap into the massive market,&rdquo; said Bonen</p><p>proteanTecs landed in Taiwan in 2020, which couldn&rsquo;t have been a harder year due to the raging pandemic. Vivian Chou, proteanTecs Regional Director of Greater China talked to us about the hardships she went through operating the single function in Taiwan, where she had to manage technical support and sales, secure region partnerships and establish distribution models.</p><p>&ldquo;We are like missionaries. As our solution is pretty new to the market, we had to work on government compliance issues and also seek out potential partners,&rdquo; said Chou. Strong commitment and support was given by proteanTecs headquarters back in Israel, which shows the company&rsquo;s commitment in this part of the market.</p><p>Currently, proteanTecs has already partnered with industry juggernaut TSMC on the island. In the meanwhile, collaboration plans with automotive makers are underway, and strategic partnerships that integrate software solutions with the company&rsquo;s technology are on the horizon.</p><p>Furthermore, Taiwan&rsquo;s wealth of talents is also a big allure for the Israeli startup. &ldquo;We are looking for application engineers and technical support personnel to join our ranks,&rdquo; said Bonen.</p></div><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47684">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47684</a></p>', '627/dc3/cb8/627dc3cb8c7a4860536926.jpg', 1, '2022-05-13 02:37:39', '2024-09-01 21:08:24', null);

He was perplexed about his future but also ambitious to somehow transform Taiwan. Luckily, Lin met professor Chun-Shan Chen, who was the Chair of Graduate Institute of Intellectual Property at Taipei Tech. At the time, Chen was planning to set up an association to assist Taiwanese manufacturers in becoming global brand enterprises.</p>

<p>This idea undoubtedly matched Lin\'s aim, so he decided to join the project. Chen said to him,“Let\'s change Taiwan bit by bit.” Thus, Global Brands Management Association (GBMA) was established in 2014.</p>

<p>Looking into what a company needs for transformation was a part of Lin\'s job, and he found that companies have to understand the local culture, industrial ecosystem, consumption habits, and sometimes the language of another country in order to go abroad. That is, someone who is familiar with the country, or even better, from the country, is a must for the company.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>The potential of Southeast Asian students in Taiwan</strong></h3>

<p>Lin then discovered the solution lies in a fact that has long been underestimated - there are a great number of Southeast Asian students in Taiwan. If these foreign talents are able to work at those Taiwanese companies during their stay, there\'d be a great opportunity for them to help the company to expand to their home countries.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the project Global Young Leaders for Global Markets and CSR (GGC) was launched and executed by Lin at the end of 2014 to help foreign students, especially students from Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) and Indian, to find internships and jobs in Taiwan. It was successfully joined by more than 10 top universities, enterprises such as MediaTek and PwC, and hundreds of foreign students each year.</p>

<p>During his years at GBMA, Lin has met people around the world and developed his own connections.“I followed professor Chen to visit a lot of big shots. I learned a lot and was grateful for having the chance to participate in those meetings,”said Lin. Yet, the professor encouraged Lin to leave GBMA to explore something different. Thus, Lin went to work at one of the largest and most respected law firms, Formosa Transnational, and became a graduate student of Graduate Institute of Intellectual Property at Taipei Tech in order to acquire further knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>How to hire foreigners in Taiwan ? &nbsp;?<a href="https://youtu.be/tRKBgt6kA5A">https://youtu.be/tRKBgt6kA5A</a></strong></p>

<p><strong></strong>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>What push foreign talents to leave when they actually want to stay in Taiwan</strong></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, an Indian friend of Lin\'s finished his Ph.D in computer science at National Chiao Tung University with a full scholarship for six years, and he wanted to start his own business in Taiwan. He came to Lin and asked for help as he was facing various obstacles to set up a company in Taiwan as a foreigner.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Lin didn\'t have enough experience and resources to solve his problem at the time.“The law regarding foreign entrepreneurs wasn\'t mature enough at the time,”explained Lin. Thus, even though his Indian friend wanted to stay and founded a company here, he still left.“Taiwan spent years cultivating a professional, however, we lost him in the end.”</p>

<p>Lin noticed that his Indian friend wasn\'t the only case. In fact, a lot of Southeast Asian students have been facing the same situation. Therefore, in 2017, combined with the experience Lin has gained at GBMA and his background in law, STARTBOARD was born to help flourish Taiwan\'s talents pool.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>From an incubator to the professional of Southeast Asian-related business</strong></h3>

<p>From industry mentors and partners, government resources, networking events to legal consulting and counseling, STARTBOARD is committed to providing a one-stop service for people from ASEAN and India that are interested in establishing companies in Taiwan. In addition, due to the approval of the National Development Council and Immigration agency, STARTBOARD is able to endorse foreign entrepreneurs for their visa.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Lin didn\'t forget his ideal and strength of assisting Taiwanese companies to go abroad as he did at GBMA. For example, many banks are planning to open branches in Southeast Asia, so they came to STARTBOARD in search of Southeast Asian graduates in Taiwan.</p>

<p>Besides, since working at companies with the registered capital under five million doesn\'t meet the requirement of applying for the working visa, small-scale companies can contract to STARTBOARD to hire foreign students as employees.</p>

<p>Yet, not only small and medium-sized companies (SMEs), STARTBOARD also provided service for one of the world\'s top 100 companies. By organizing an entrepreneur competition in India, STARTBOARD helped the enterprise to explore local talents as they planned to set up their own brand there.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>STARTBOARD earn its endorsement from global representatives through trust</strong></h3>

<p>With the connections Lin has been building since working at GBMA and his sincere care for foriegn students and talents, he and his team showed the companies and even embassies from ASEAN and India that STARTBOARD is a trustworthy bridge for deeper partnership between the countries.</p>

<p>STARTBOARD was the only company invited when the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei held an event, and STARTBOARD has already set up their first oversea branch office in Thailand. In addition, the Representative of Indonesian Economic and Trade Office even attended STARTBOARD\'s networking event and offered assistance to Taiwanese manufacturers regarding exporting issues.“It is all built on trust,”said Lin.</p>

However, it is challenging to collect needed information rapidly and correctly. The emergence of matching platform is like serving as a bridge between Bole and Maxima. It not only makes demand sides find the most suitable talent in the fastest situation, but also allows supply sides to have a platform to show themselves.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>The Value of Every Citizens of The Planet Deserves To Be Seen</strong></h3>

<p>ArtzyPlanet, which gathers creators in the field of design, music, and film, is a co-creation media community founded in 2019. The platform is capable of meeting both the “displaying and exchanging works” on the supply side and “search for suitable talent” on the demand side at the same time. As of 2020, it had accumulated more than 6,000 creators. ArtzyPlanet lets members put their work on the platform, build their own portfolios, and connect with others to get inspired. Moreover, because talents in three fields are putting together, it can efficiently assist in matching suitable talents for entrepreneur or company to decrease the costs of labor and time.</p>

<p>ArtzyPlanet establishes “Planet Lab”, which has a variety of materials that creators can download safely. On the works left by the predecessors, a new creation is mixed and matched through their own skillful hands. In addition, it establishes “Planet Exhibition Hall”, which held competitions or solicitations for papers in cooperation with enterprises from time to time. Not only do help company to find creative works, but also inspire creators and break through themselves.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3><strong>Create Your Own Family Gym</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">AcXport is a professional app and a sporty platform with a wealth of sports. Serving as a bridge between coach and consumers, it can help you to find suitable and professional sport service and coach after you choose the sport you want to train. Moreover, the platform not only teaches sports, but also promotes sports. Their official website provides different subject of articles, such as recommended sport places, personal interview of coach, health management, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">In recent years, there are more restrictions on going out to exercise or going to the gym because of the impact of COVID-19. However, the service of AcXport is committed to transfer multi-sport experiences to entertainment that is easy for the public to start. Not only do allow you to find the fittest sport method to you by easy way, but also create your own gym without expensive expense.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Advantages and Position of Matching Platform</strong></h3>

<p>The matching platform integrates scattered data, and allows users to get complete information by it and connects with others. Like ArtzyPlanet and AcXport above, they act as a bridge between supply and demand side, integrating huge amounts of data and to output the most effective information to entrepreneurs or consumers. With the expansion of the digital economy era, STARTBOARD, which matchs start-up team and enterprise, believes that the mechanism of this platform economy will become a trend in the future. Whether it is the Yourator talent matching platform or the Airbnb transactional platform, it can not only improve the efficiency of market matching, but also reduce the time cost spent in the past.<strong><br></strong></p>

To compare with that in 2015, the number has increased 8% in these 5 years. Traveling alone overseas itself is not easy let alone studying in a foreign country for a period of time. WillStudy has an insight into some of the problems we might encounter when applying for schools and after studying abroad. Today, WillStudy has successfully helped 2000+ students with the title of the best startup by U-Start, Ministry of Education in 2019.</p>

<h3><strong>Good Helper For Studying Abroad</strong></h3>

<p>Bill, the founder of WillStudy, found that the information is inadequate for Taiwan students when they prepare for applying to study abroad. Difficulties might be encountered both before and during application preparation, and the services of consultants are unable to meet the specific needs of each student. They anticipate that they could share what they have and what they experienced. Hence, they established WillStudy in 2019, committed to create a domestic study abroad ecosystem. It provides information integration before going abroad, resource matching in preparation, and assistance in arriving in the country you study abroad. WillStudy look forward to becoming a platform which can allow Taiwanese students to get more contact and information to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<br>

<h3><strong>The Experiences of Predecessors</strong></h3>

<p>The official website of WillStudy contains different types of columns, including life of studying abroad, sharing of people with experience abroad, interviews with overseas career figures, and travel selections, the content of each article can bring great help to students planning to go abroad. In addition, WillStudy established one-on-one alumni consultation platform for studying abroad, which includes more than 280+ consultants, students can consult for different discipline clusters, degrees, and industries. With personal experience of specially assigned person, they can much deeply realize how to prepare and what to encounter when they study abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Talents Are Studying Abroad</strong></h3>

<p>In this era, the ways of apply for schools overseas have changed drastically. Instead of facing consultants in an agency, WillStudy has opened our eyes with the new method of online consulting and other self-help access to another dimension of studying abroad. STARTBOARD, also known as a company that helps companies expand their business overseas, is very glad to see more Taiwanese talents going abroad. STARTBOARD definitely has foreseen a bright future with the trend of studying abroad.</p>', '62b/d79/62d/62bd7962da2c6210026917.jpg', 1, '2022-06-30 10:24:15', '2022-06-30 10:27:54', null);

<p>The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Tuesday (July 19) announced that it will end the mask requirement for scooter riders, cyclists, and people working in outdoor open spaces.</p>

<p>During a press conference on that afternoon, CECC head Victor Wang (王必勝) announced that amid the sweltering summer heat, the mask rules will be relaxed for those heavily exerting themselves outdoors. Specifically, Wang said that those riding scooters and bicycles will no longer have to wear a face mask, effective immediately.</p>

<p>In addition, Wang said that people working in open spaces outdoors will also no longer have to wear a face mask, with immediate effect. Wang said that an example would be construction workers, and he defined open spaces as places where people can maintain the proper social distance from strangers.</p>

<p>When asked by a member of the media whether people going for a stroll outside can also take their masks off. Wang replied by saying that walking can be considered a form of exercise and, based on the existing regulations, people engaged in outdoor exercise are already permitted to take off their masks.</p>

<p>As for why the outdoor mask rule has not been eliminated entirely, Wang explained that the center assessed that for epidemic prevention purposes it is still needed in some cases. Wang said that the main situation in which people outdoors can avoid wearing masks is when they are in open spaces where they can maintain a proper social distance from strangers.</p>

<p>Wang said that the CECC will gradually relax the mask regulations in stages as long as the risks are deemed to have reached an acceptable level.</p>

However, their melting point is very low, resulting in the fat melting in the pans and a greasy plant-smelled piece of vegan meat. Other scientists have tried to use cultivated animal fat, yet it clearly does not fit strict vegan diets. Now, here comes the breakthrough of Lypid: the encapsulation technique.</p><p>Dr. Michelle Lee, cofounder and CTO of Lypid, is the expert of the encapsulation technique. She applied the technology with some special processing technology and formulation, which make liquid vegan oils to stand up to 165 degrees Celsius and contains more water components. With the fat still sticking onto the meat, the sense of creaminess, chewiness and juiciness is preserved. &ldquo;If you look into animal fat, it&rsquo;s not just lipid. It contains water, too.

This is a long-standing challenge that the worldwide nutraceutical market thought was unsolvable. But a Taiwanese startup &ndash; boncha Bio &ndash; became the heroic problem-solver. Throughout a tough journey, it has successfully made supplements taste as delicious as soft sweets yet remain high-dose and high bioactivity.</p></blockquote><p>In a post-pandemic world, staying healthy is at the forefront of many people&rsquo;s minds. Yet, it is still difficult to make taking supplements a daily routine, as these little pieces either have some unpleasant odors or are simply like a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>But what if someone could turn capsules, pills, and tablets into something tasty, easy-to-swallow as soft sweets? It is a seemingly impossible dream that Corina Huang &ndash; founder of boncha Bio &ndash; has made come true.</p><p>&ldquo;The nutrition industry tends to put all the emphasis on formulation,&rdquo; the Taiwanese entrepreneur says, &ldquo;but no matter how much nutrition a nutraceutical product contains, it is only effective when people are willing to take it on a regular basis.&rdquo;</p><p>Developing user-friendly supplements is not a brand new idea among nutraceutical companies.

She founded a manufacturing technology platform &ndash; boncha Bio &ndash; aiming to develop candy-like supplements that are both potent and delicious.</p><p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio&rsquo;s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. &ldquo;We call them [the products] &lsquo;candyceuticals&rsquo; for a reason: We have overcome the low-dose and low-bioactivity limitation of user-friendly supplements,&rdquo; wrote on boncha Bio&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Currently partnered with many well-known nutritional brands and pharmaceutical enterprises, the Taiwanese firm attracts 4-5 new business clients every week. One of its clients is reported to have a 50% local market share in the nutraceutical of its market. Moreover, last year Corina won an international female entrepreneur award &ndash;<a href="https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/fellow/corina-huang" target="_blank">Cartier Women&#39;s Initiative Laureate</a> &ndash; in East Asia, standing out from over 800 candidates.</p><p>Yet, looking back, Corina describes herself as &quot;half an amateur&quot;.</p><h2>The inspiration comes from witnessing her grandmother&#39;s pill-related difficulty swallowing</h2><p>Before stepping into the nutraceutical industry, Corina was the founder of a customized candy manufacturer that printed images, words, or patterns on sweets.</p><p>The idea of turning pills into candies actually came from Corina&rsquo;s grandmother. About a decade ago, her grandmother suffered a stroke and required additional nutrients for her recovery. But due to pill-related difficulty swallowing, the capsules and tablets kept getting stuck in her throat. Corina still remembers how she had to break the pills into pieces for her granny, an act that highly affected the efficacy.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ca6/c89/96d/ca6c8996dddc4ed567c4fbda5a38729d587589b5.jpg" alt="網站產品頁-益生菌介紹-11.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio&rsquo;s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. /Photograph : boncha Bio</p><p>The truth is, what Corina&rsquo;s grandmother experienced is not uncommon.&ndash; She thought if her granny suffered this kind of difficulties, then there would be more people facing the similar situation in the world. Surprisingly, one out of two experiences difficulty swallowing pills and capsules. Its symptoms can actually happen to people of all ages.</p><p>To tackle the problem, Corina decided to start a new business. Since the type of candy Corina wanted to make is not hard and firm, but soft and juicy &ndash; which is considered even more user-friendly &ndash; the journey was full of hurdles.</p><h2>The research process: thousands of failures with no end in sight</h2><p>&ldquo;Just to develop the candy shell, we have tested more than 400 recipes and parameters,&rdquo; Corina says that the ultimate goal was to create sweets with an outer layer of soft coat and tasty liquid fillings. &ldquo;Each day, our team could only test 1-2 recipes and wait for 1-3 more days to check if the shell can stay intact and no liquid would be leaking.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, they managed to reach the goal. But another challenge arose when it came to probiotic supplements. &ldquo;Live probiotics are extremely delicate,&rdquo; Corina says. &ldquo;They are afraid of light, water, and heat, cannot withstand pressure, and their life cycle is only 48 hours.&rdquo;</p><p>During each experiment, the research team would insert billions of probiotics into the sample and send it to a third-party testing unit. &ldquo;Suppose we add 10 billion probiotics, then we&rsquo;ll see how many are left after a week or even a year,&rdquo; Corina says the process is prolonged because this way, they can ensure the high quality.</p><p>But the goal seemed impossible to fulfill when experiments failed over and over again. &ldquo;It&#39;s thousands of failures with no end in sight,&rdquo; Corina says. It took them three years to finally reach the point where up to 10 billion live probiotics can be preserved.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/d9c/792/4a1/d9c7924a1a37a8b13e6dbe75b76a352b593ba8b0.jpg" alt="IMG_3633(S)" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>But the goal seemed impossible to fulfill when experiments failed over and over again. &ldquo;It&#39;s thousands of failures with no end in sight,&rdquo; Corina says. / Photograph :Meet Global</p><p>The product soon became one of boncha Bio&rsquo;s specialties. Not only did the researchers succeed in keep live probiotics gently dormant in the central filling, but they also managed to add &ldquo;prebiotics&rdquo; &ndash; plant fibers that can stimulate the growth of healthy bacteria in the gut &ndash; to the candy shell. In doing so, when people chew the candy, the prebiotics in the candy shell will naturally feed the probiotics, enhancing the survival rate of probiotic to colonize in the colon.</p><h2>Delicious supplements that business and individual customers both crave for</h2><p>By solving several long-standing problems in the market, boncha Bio&rsquo;s reputation has gradually spread. Apart from the Asian market, nutraceutical businesses in western countries have also taken notice of this Taiwanese startup.</p><p>Extending its footprints in western markets, boncha Bio is well-prepared to face the fierce competition. When asked how to compete with peers, Corina says in a confident tone: &ldquo;Just try one [candyceutical], and they [customers] will know the difference.&rdquo;</p><p>Take fish oil as an example. Although it is widely accepted as an essential dietary supplement, its notorious fishy smell deters many. But boncha Bio managed to overcome the issue with a flavor-masking technique. The team once brought hundreds of samples to an exhibition in Switzerland. Without any pungent odor, the taste of their fish oil candies was so impressive that their samples ran out in a moment.</p><p>Boncha Bio&rsquo;s &ldquo;candies&rdquo; are so popular that despite being a B2B company, even individual consumers become the brand&rsquo;s big fans. &ldquo;Some people will try to contact our sales team and ask us if they can buy supplements directly from us,&rdquo; Corina says.</p><p>In Taiwan, boncha Bio cooperated with Family Mart &ndash; a Japanese convenience store franchise chain &ndash; to provide two new products: the lutein for eye care and eight herbal extracts for throat care. Then the startup soon received messages from consumers saying that shelves in the stores were empty and they wanted to buy in bulk.</p><h2>Cartier Women&rsquo;s Initiative: a community where female entrepreneurs learn and grow together</h2><p>&ldquo;We are not inventing something new,&rdquo; Corina points out. &ldquo;Instead, we are trying to integrate all the pre-existing resources and invest in the right topic.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2021, Corina was awarded as Cartier Women&#39;s Initiative Laureate in East Asia. It is an annual international entrepreneurship program open to women-run and women-owned businesses that bring sustainable social or environmental impacts.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c9f/9f8/9db/c9f9f89dbe799d5531323b7ba68c061c50366a14.jpg" alt="IMG_4301" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>In 2021, Corina was awarded as Cartier Women&#39;s Initiative Laureate in East Asia. / Photograph : Meet Global</p><p>With an award-winning record, boncha Bio grabbed the media&#39;s attention. Around 10 news reports came out shortly afterward. Yet, in Corina&rsquo;s opinion, the spotlight is not the most important. What she truly cherishes is the community she earned during the competition.</p><p>As women leaders are still fewer than men in the startup market, &ldquo;Cartier Women&rsquo;s Initiative has created a global community where female entrepreneurs can learn and grow together,&rdquo; Corina says.</p><p>It took her one year to pass the final stage of the assessment. But after the hard work paid off, she felt empowered.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it [Cartier Women&#39;s Initiative] is the bridge between our team and the global market,&rdquo; Corina says. &ldquo;As my job is to make people get healthy with ease and peace of mind, I have started to realize how meaningful it is and how much responsibility I need to take.&rdquo;</p><p>In the coming years, boncha Bio plans to continuously approach enterprise clients in Europe and America. By targeting sizable and international companies, Corina believes it is a way to make the greatest impact.</p><p>The bigger the nutraceutical brand, the more end users can benefit from it. At last, Corina may be able to convince more people that taking dietary supplements isn&#39;t necessarily a mundane task; it can actually be an enjoyment.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47769">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47769</a></p>', '62f/ca7/510/62fca75102610674695330.jpg', 1, '2022-08-17 08:33:09', '2024-09-01 21:03:03', null);

	<p>Is it possible to turn pills into candy dosage form without any compromise on nutrient efficacy? This is a long-standing challenge that the worldwide nutraceutical market thought was unsolvable. But a Taiwanese startup – boncha Bio – became the heroic problem-solver. Throughout a tough journey, it has successfully made supplements taste as delicious as soft sweets yet remain high-dose and high bioactivity.</p>

<p>In a post-pandemic world, staying healthy is at the forefront of many people’s minds. Yet, it is still difficult to make taking supplements a daily routine, as these little pieces either have some unpleasant odors or are simply like a hard pill to swallow.</p>

<p>But what if someone could turn capsules, pills, and tablets into something tasty, easy-to-swallow as soft sweets? It is a seemingly impossible dream that Corina Huang – founder of boncha Bio – has made come true.</p>

<p>“The nutrition industry tends to put all the emphasis on formulation,” the Taiwanese entrepreneur says, “but no matter how much nutrition a nutraceutical product contains, it is only effective when people are willing to take it on a regular basis.”</p>

<p>Developing user-friendly supplements is not a brand new idea among nutraceutical companies. The real problem is, traditional confectionary dosage manufacturing techniques which require high temperatures and high pressure can kill off up to 85% of functional ingredients and lead to a significant drop in the bioactivity retention rate, hence affecting absorption rates.</p>

<p>Facing a challenge that the entire global market thought was unsolvable, Corina started from scratch. She founded a manufacturing technology platform – boncha Bio – aiming to develop candy-like supplements that are both potent and delicious.</p>

<p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio’s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. “We call them [the products] ‘candyceuticals’ for a reason: We have overcome the low-dose and low-bioactivity limitation of user-friendly supplements,” wrote on boncha Bio’s website.</p>

<p>Currently partnered with many well-known nutritional brands and pharmaceutical enterprises, the Taiwanese firm attracts 4-5 new business clients every week. One of its clients is reported to have a 50% local market share in the nutraceutical of its market. Moreover, last year Corina won an international female entrepreneur award –<a href="https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/fellow/corina-huang" target="_blank">Cartier Women\'s Initiative Laureate</a> – in East Asia, standing out from over 800 candidates.</p>

<p>Yet, looking back, Corina describes herself as "half an amateur".</p>

<h2>The inspiration comes from witnessing her grandmother\'s pill-related difficulty swallowing</h2>

<p>Before stepping into the nutraceutical industry, Corina was the founder of a customized candy manufacturer that printed images, words, or patterns on sweets.</p>

<p>The idea of turning pills into candies actually came from Corina’s grandmother. About a decade ago, her grandmother suffered a stroke and required additional nutrients for her recovery. But due to pill-related difficulty swallowing, the capsules and tablets kept getting stuck in her throat. Corina still remembers how she had to break the pills into pieces for her granny, an act that highly affected the efficacy.</p>

<p>After thousands of attempts, boncha Bio’s confectionary supplement turned out to retain high bioactivity of nutrients. /Photograph : boncha Bio</p>

<p>The truth is, what Corina’s grandmother experienced is not uncommon.– She thought if her granny suffered this kind of difficulties, then there would be more people facing the similar situation in the world. Surprisingly, one out of two experiences difficulty swallowing pills and capsules. Its symptoms can actually happen to people of all ages.</p>

<p>To tackle the problem, Corina decided to start a new business. Since the type of candy Corina wanted to make is not hard and firm, but soft and juicy – which is considered even more user-friendly – the journey was full of hurdles.</p>

<h2>The research process: thousands of failures with no end in sight</h2>

<p>“Just to develop the candy shell, we have tested more than 400 recipes and parameters,” Corina says that the ultimate goal was to create sweets with an outer layer of soft coat and tasty liquid fillings. “Each day, our team could only test 1-2 recipes and wait for 1-3 more days to check if the shell can stay intact and no liquid would be leaking.”</p>

<p>In the end, they managed to reach the goal. But another challenge arose when it came to probiotic supplements. “Live probiotics are extremely delicate,” Corina says. “They are afraid of light, water, and heat, cannot withstand pressure, and their life cycle is only 48 hours.”</p>

<p>During each experiment, the research team would insert billions of probiotics into the sample and send it to a third-party testing unit. “Suppose we add 10 billion probiotics, then we’ll see how many are left after a week or even a year,” Corina says the process is prolonged because this way%', '630/864/a63/630864a631583957666435.jpg', 0, '2022-08-26 06:14:09', '2022-08-26 06:28:05', '2022-08-26 06:28:05');

<p>With its neighboring countries looking to tighten their rules on crypto, Taiwan has a good chance of achieving its goal of becoming a fin-tech hub in Asia as it recently approved the application of 24 virtual asset providers.</p>

<p>For many decades, Taiwan’s financial sector is highly-regulated as it is cautious of the inflow of capital related to money laundering. However, the government has recently relaxed its rules in a bid to spur financial innovation and turn Taiwan into a fin-tech hub.</p>

<p>To compare, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it is considering restricting retail investors’ use of leverage and credit facilities to trade cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, Japan has high tax rates for crypto with a progressive tax rate that varies from 5% to 45%, depending on the number of total profits.</p>

<p>Last week, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) of the Banking Bureau of Taiwan released a list of <a href="https://www.banking.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=818&amp;parentpath=0,609" target="_blank">24 registered virtual asset providers</a> (VASPs). WooTech Taiwan Ltd. was included in this list.</p>

<p>“This is an important milestone for us as many foreign-owned firms are seeking to serve the Chinese-speaking market who are looking to diversify their portfolios. Taiwan’s potential on its own is huge given its high per capita income and fin-tech-savviness,” said Jack Tan, founder and CEO of WOO Network.</p>

<p>“This decision gives us ample confidence that Taiwan regulators are trying to strike a balance between supporting innovation and protecting users,” Tan noted.</p>

<p>To date, the total historical trading volume on WOO X is over 240 billion USD. WOO Network has more than 20 partners including Avalanche, Binance, Crypto.com, Cardano, and NEAR.</p>

<h2>Taiwan approval details</h2>

<p>“In general, the approval that we obtained means that we are fully compliant with implementing the AML measures, as stipulated by Taiwan law. It allows us to engage in: crypto to fiat exchange; crypto to crypto exchange; transfer of cryptocurrencies; safekeeping or administration of cryptocurrencies; and offering and issuance of cryptocurrencies,” said Chloe Tsai, Head of Legal and AML at WOO Network.</p>

<p>According to the FSC document, businesses that have completed the declaration of compliance with the Money Laundering Prevention Act are responsible for the implementation of the Money Laundering Prevention Act on their behalf. Those who obtained the approval are to take measures to prevent money laundering and combat terrorism on their virtual currency platforms and trading business.</p>

<p>“One of the requirements for us is to create an independent Taiwan app to house all Taiwanese users. On our Taiwan app, users cannot access futures/margin, while all FE and BE are separated from our global app,” explained Tsai.</p>

<p>“We are also taking big steps to allow our platform to engage in crypto to fiat exchange starting with one of the big local banks in Taiwan, and hopefully soon with other banks,” said Tsai.</p>

How can Taiwan businesses leverage the upticking deep tech developements amid this investment gloom?</p></blockquote><p>One area of investment is bucking the &ldquo;funding winter&rdquo; downturn as warned by Sequoia Capital. Deep tech (or hard tech) has gained attention from investors due to its slow but steady growth amid a flurry of investment snowstorms that caused slumps in market valuation.</p><p>&ldquo;Deep tech is the fundamental science that charts the path for new applications across multiple industries. Consider it a kind of &lsquo;platform technology&rsquo;, if you will,&rdquo; said Dr. Michelle Kiang, co-founder of Impact Science Ventures (ISV).</p><p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. The three founders of ISV, Michelle Kiang, Alain Harrus and Robert Ethier, combine their academic strengths, industry experience and investment expertise to scale deep tech startups.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/84f/077/bfc/84f077bfcfc5801dca08202d15f98a6bcb0f3881.jpg" alt="ISV founders" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. /Photograph : ISV</p><p>As a VC operator based in the US, Kiang&rsquo;s ties with Taiwan may provide oppotunities for bilateral cooperation. Kiang is born-and-raised in Taiwan, she then went on to study Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, an academia that incubated many prominent figures including Barry Lam, founder of Quanta Computer.</p><p>A quantum physicist who got her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, Kiang got her start in entrepreneurship shortly after grad school to commercialize her invention as part of her thesis and spent her early career building semiconductor and communications products as co-founder and CEO/CMO at a number of successful startups. She also held executive roles in strategy and corporate development at TDK, Micron Technology and NeoPhotonics.</p><p>Although there&rsquo;s a longer return horizon for deep tech investments, it&rsquo;s a niche for some investors&mdash; it&rsquo;s an advantage only those with considerable industry experience and investment acumen can leverage. Once successfully commercialized, deep tech startups possess the revolutionary power to change the world. From silicon chips, artificial intelligence to solar tech, all of which are deep tech that has changed our way of life.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/563/05d/c69/56305dc6994991eeb5ec028e8429b44ea1f07b27.jpg" alt="chirp_7236" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>The initial Chirp team while they were at the UC Berkeley Skydeck Accerlerator Program. Kiang is a serial entrepreneur. Chirp Microsystems is one of her many co-founded startups, which was later acquired by TDK, the world&#39;s leading electronic component company. /Photograph : Michelle</p><h2>Deep tech, not for the faint of heart</h2><p>Kiang talked about how they came to focus on deep tech investment. &ldquo;We believe major problems around the world will be solved by deep tech,&rdquo; said Kiang firmly. That is, deep tech could have positive economic as well as social impact on the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Cohort companies of ISV include startups like <a href="https://www.umarofoods.com/" target="_blank">UMARO</a> which looks to redefine plant-based food, <a href="https://antoraenergy.com/" target="_blank">Antora Energy</a> that decarbonized heavy industry with renewable heat, and <a href="https://www.liminalinsights.com/" target="_blank">Liminal</a> that seeks to help EV makers avoid costly battery recalls.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/9ff/ddd/461/9ffddd46191971f9f305bb8cd3a7fc2e3cb864c3.jpg" alt="ISV-Energy" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Founded in 2021, ISV invests in fundamental science breakthroughs across key impact sectors, including agriculture, semiconductors, manufacturing, energy, materials and biotech. /Photograph : ISV Official Website</p><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the applications of deep tech is extremely extensive. Take the example of Antora Energy. Having successfully scaled, its decarbonizing thermal management solutions could be applied to heavy industries like cement, steel or petrochemicals, contributing to a greener Earth.</p><p>Deep tech and hard tech investment is far from a walk in a park. In the process of deep tech commercialization, scaling up is one hard job to get done. A much longer time frame is needed for deep tech to be commercialized, and a wide array of skill sets must be deployed.</p><p>&ldquo;From one to one million. That is the tricky part,&rdquo; said Kiang. Hard tech isn&rsquo;t like software innovation or consumer products, where you could easily release copies of products or services. Hard tech innovation requires deeper due diligence tasks, heavier capital investment, and more time to grow into large assets.</p><p>ISV brought in advisors to make use of their field expertise, ensuring high-quality due diligence. Not only do the group of advisors provide key insights to the VC side, but they also give valuable recommendations to the startups in question to help them accelerate growth and achieve market success.</p><p>&ldquo;We consider ourselves somewhat of an incubator program,&rdquo; said Kiang. Being much more than a VC, ISV has now grown an outstanding portfolio that exerts a positive impact on the world.</p><p>As far as deep tech investment goes, there are three critical elements that make for a great one. The keys are &ldquo;differentiable tech, hands-on industry experience and a good team,&rdquo; according to Kiang. Take Antora Energy, a portfolio company of ISV, to illustrate.</p><p>Antora aims to stop climate change through affordable thermal energy storage system. Its tech is differentiable with other solar tech for its on-demand supply and affordability. As one Antora founder calls it, their tech is &ldquo;hot as hell and dirt cheap&rdquo;.</p><p>Moreover, the team behind Antora possess diverse experience which complements each other wonderfully. While two co-founders are fresh phD graduates, the other one is a startup veteran having founded a solar-tech startup prior to this experience.</p><h2>Will Taiwan be the next stop?</h2><p>Amid geopolitical tensions, Taiwan not only made its name to political headlines but also business front pages. What was mostly known to people outside Taiwan about the island is mainly its state-of-the-art semiconductor technology. But Taiwan has more to offer in terms of global business partnerships than that.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/d5c/65e/6fc/d5c65e6fc92ec9606ee1492891ed5dc9b4ba5256.jpg" alt="Taipei 101" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>As a VC operator based in the US, Kiang&rsquo;s ties with Taiwan may provide oppotunities for bilateral cooperation. / Photograph : Unsplash</p><div data-aid="47791"><p>Kiang shared some key insights on U.S.-Taiwan partnerships. It&rsquo;s an unprecendented advantage for Taiwan amid geopolitical tensions, however, foreign VC funding still has not gained a full picture of Taiwan&rsquo;s industry landscape and the opportunites it has to offer.</p><p>In the near future, Kiang looks forward to connect U.S. startups with Taiwanese businesses, and vice versa. Channels of investment also include government-funded VC projects. Prior to joining ISV, Kiang was a venture partner at Industrial Technology Investment Corporation (ITIC), a subsidiary of Taiwan&rsquo;s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).</p><p>For those startups who seek funding from U.S.-based VCs, Kiang has pitched in some advice. First of all, it bodes well with VCs when startups aims at addressing global issues as opposed to local problems that will be hard to see extensive application. Furthermore, if a Taiwanese startup has already built connections with the U.S. market (i.e. established client ties), VCs will be more convinced to channel their funding energy into them.</p><p>To Kiang&rsquo;s belief, Taiwan will be a major role in deep tech development. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that just because I&rsquo;m Taiwanese,&rdquo; said Kiang. It is her extensive expertise in the field that gave her the instinct to sniff out great opportunities in the world and for the world.</p></div><div data-sid="Meet_D_Article_bottom_video">〔Original :Meet Global〕<br>&nbsp;<a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47791">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47791</a></div>', '633/d3a/650/633d3a6500a0d668997461.jpg', 1, '2022-10-05 08:06:35', '2024-09-01 19:33:21', null);

For example, Asia Pacific Telecom, a mid-to-large enterprise, cooperates with MAKAR REALITY to apply 5G technology to Songyan Cultural and Creative Park.

<h2>Taiwanese alternative protein startup, Lypid goes to COP27</h2>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2022-07%2Fimg-1658806519-92216.png&amp;w=900&amp;maxage=90d" alt="Lypid 路易莎咖啡 植物肉.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Lypid was recently invited to give a speech at COP27 in Egpyt, which amaze the globe by showing alternative fat made by their leading-edge alternative protein technology, PhytoFat. / Photograph: Lypid</p>

<p>Lypid, a startup that stands out in the vegan market by leveraging the “fat”, led to their milestone this year by partnering with Taiwan\'s largest coffee chain, Louisa Coffee, to serve juicy and plant-based meat used in sandwiches, rice burgers, muffins, and bagels throughout more than 500 stores operating in Taiwan. They were recently invited to give a speech at COP27 in Egpyt, which amaze the globe by showing alternative fat made by their leading-edge alternative protein technology, PhytoFat.</p>

<p>“The listeners were so surprised by how our alternative fat can be applied to not only meat but also dessert,” says Dr. Jen-Yu Huang, Co-founder and CEO of Lypid, as he recalls the reaction of the audience while he explained Lypid’s “versatile vegan fat” at one of the COP27’s events hosted by Green Generation Fund &amp; Global Alliance for a Sustainable Planet. “Unlike spreading weasel words or discussing the new technology and what can we do in the future, we were talking about what we had already done.”</p>

<p>Lypid’s partnership with Louisa Coffee is a vivid example of their ambition to shift non-vegetarians’ diet habits. Huang highlights Lypid’s aim is to make plant-based meat more delicious which will attract more people to make the vegan choice spontaneously, and reduce the number of people who consume meat that produces a large amount of greenhouse-gas emissions. “That is how Lypid’s vegan fat helps global development in solving the climate issue,” explains Huang.</p>

<p>In terms of the advantage of Taiwan to dedicate to the ESG field, Huang underscores Taiwan is a role model for the alternative food industry due to its long-developed vegan market and huge vegetarian population which also surprised many audiences at COP27.</p>

<p>However, the relevance between the food industry and the environment is not always the first thing that people would think of while discussing how to solve climate issues. “The concept of food sustainability has a massive impact on the environment and is quite fresh for most people, especially for the attendants at COP27 are mostly from the official or people who are not in the food industry”. Huang hopes to disseminate this concept to more people, even the government unit who are making the decisions.</p>

<p>Other than that, “It was hard to find plant-based food options that served at the event.” says Dr. Michelle Lee, co-founder and CTO of Lypid, who discovered a situation during the COP27. “Many entrepreneurs who present at the day were struggling to find food to eat because they are vegans.” Michelle hopes to see more alternative food served at the COP28, “It would also let the people realise how the technology has developed so far and bring a refreshing perspective to people about the taste of vegan food,” suggests Michelle.</p>

<h2>From Taiwan to the globe! Space Bao’s vegan pan-fried bun will be at Costco</h2>

<p>In addition to the collaboration with Louisa Coffee, Space Bao, a Taiwanese restaurant selling vegan pan-fried bun made a strategic partnership with Lypid. One of their latest products is a traditional pepper-flavoured pan-fried bun which features Lypid’s PhytoFat.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Liu, the founder of Space Bao and other two famous and award-winning vegan restaurants shares a common goal with Lypid of “making vegan food more delicious”. He also promotes the ideas of “flexitarian” and “meat-free days twice a week”, “these are more acceptable and painless for people who are not vegetarian but want to change their eating habits,” says Jeffrey. It encourages more people to try vegan food without entirely giving up meat but contributes to sustainability, simultaneously.</p>

<p>One of his restaurants, Little Tree Food was granted a double Michelin award in 2022. One is the Michelin Green Star which recognises their distinguished contribution to environmental sustainability; The Bib Gourmand award acknowledged Little Tree Food is an affordable Michelin restaurant where customers only need to spend under NTD 1000 to enjoy 3 dishes.</p>

<p>Disrupting the dominant vegan product, burger steak by featuring Asian preference for meat, Jeffrey choose to develop vegan ground meat and created the delicious vegan pan-fried bun. With the aim of making their juicy vegan pan-fried bun available outside of Taiwan, he made a proposal in order to sell the pan-fried bun at Costco which is the fifth largest retailer in the world and promote Taiwan’s advanced technology in the food industry at the same time.</p>

<p>Apart from the plant-based food industry, mangrove forests often come to people’s minds as one of the solutions to the climate crisis. However, urban development, agriculture and aquaculture have been observed to be the major causes of mangrove deforestation.</p>

<h2>Leverage AIoT with the aim to solve deforestation this startup can reduce 100 million tons of CO2</h2>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2021-12%2Fimg-1640767528-43339.jpg&amp;w=900&amp;maxage=90d" alt="艾滴科技_創業午餐會" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>ID Water is a leading aquaculture startup that aims at achieving digital agriculture and digital farming to solve climate change with its AIoT solution. They developed a farming model which integrates the water quality monitoring system, AI data analysis and IoT automation technology, in an effort to reduce carbon footprint, labor cost, increase the unit yield and achieve a sustainable future for aquaculture.</p>

<p>Conforming to the government’s green power policy, ID Water not only provides one-stop farming services to maintain fishery farming but also creates “shrimp and electricity symbiosis farms” through the partnership with energy suppliers in 2022. This helps shrimp farmers increase their productions more effectively and decreases the carbon footprint of traditional farming which cause serious mangrove deforestation. Shrimp farming is quite susceptible to the environment, in particular, drastic changes in climate and water quality are likely to cause shrimp-induced diseases which would pollute the whole farm. This highlight the need for the water quality monitoring system that ID Water has offered.</p>

<p>Up to 70% of the carbon emission of agriculture comes from deforestation, which underlines the importance of maintaining the forest. However, “to do the shrimp farming needs to deforest the mangrove constantly, it is definitely not sustainable,” states Alan Yu, the founder of ID Water. Not to mention the fact that the mangrove tree possesses higher carbon fixation capacity than the terrestrial trees. “We are planning to build 100,000 hectares of the breeding ponds in 10-year which could reduce 100 million tons of carbon dioxide,” anticipates Alan, as he points out ID Water’s mission, is to solve the pressing problem of mangrove deforestation from the traditional aquaculture.</p>

<p>For the ambition for the sustainability of aquaculture and bringing their product to the globe, ID Water’s next step is Vietnam, the second-largest shrimp export country in the world. They are planning to make strategic cooperation with a shrimp processing factory that provides shrimp-made products to Haidilao Hot Pot. This famous Chinese hot pot restaurant chain occupies around 1400 branches worldwide.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After a two-year break, the annual U.S. tech gathering, the Consumer Electronic Show (CES), came to a close in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

<p>Billed as the biggest consumer electronics show, drawing 100,000 people, it is an important meeting ground for top-tier electronics companies from Taiwan like Asus and Acer. CES has also become an important venue for Taiwan’s most promising startups.</p>

<p>“I would say that we had a wonderful harvest this year. We had about double or triple the number of visitors when compared to past years. And there were lots of customers and investors excited to learn about Taiwan companies,” said Andrea Hsu (許增如) Director General, Department of Academia-Industry Collaboration and Science Park Affairs, National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://wsrv.nl/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbnextmedia.s3.hicloud.net.tw%2Fimage%2Falbum%2F2023-01%2Fimg-1672988609-50768.jpeg&amp;w=1200&amp;maxage=90d" alt="國科會1120106照片3( 國科會副主委陳宗權與科技新創團隊於CES 2023 TTA台灣館開幕合" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Hsu’s organization, NSTC, is a branch of Taiwan central government and also supervises three main science parks which host more than 1,000 companies dedicated to everything from semiconductors to biotechnology.</p>

<p>“We have a strong semiconductor industry here which leads to lots of revenue. We also provide a solid foundation and nurture other industries such as all kinds of smart applications and startups,” said Hsu.</p>

<p>In particular, the Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) was founded and sponsored by NTSC in 2018 to specifically pair young startups with the resources they need. “Right now, TTA works with nine international accelerators to help these young companies develop,” said Hsu.</p>

<p>Taiwanese startups attending CES were given the opportunity to exhibit at the TTA Pavilion at Eureka Park, though each startup had to pay their own travel expenses and be accepted by CES event organizers. A similar arrangement has been made for other international exhibitions later in the year, like Vivatech in Paris and London Tech Week.</p>

<p>“It is not easy to be accepted to CES as some 235 different companies applied and only 96 were accepted. We are fortunate to have a good location in Eureka Park, which is the heart of CES,” said Hsu.</p>

<p>The TTA pavilion this year was divided into four distinct sections: digital health, sport and climate tech, AI &amp; cybersecurity, and digital transformation. Aside from showcasing these major startup fields, particular care was given to the location of the TTA Pavilion, positioned adjacent to other technologically advanced countries such as Japan and the Netherlands, allowing for joint demonstrations.</p>

<p>“We held many events together, especially pitches which involved the same topic as other countries. I observed there are a lot of startups\' presence at Eureka Park focused on smart health solutions to make life better,” said Hsu.</p>

<p>One highlight of this year’s exhibition was 10 Taiwanese startups specially selected for the CES Innovation Award. The list of winners included: Artificial Intelligence Co., CytoAurora Biotechnologies, DeClock Intelligences Co., ible Technology Inc., Mbran Filtra Co., Ltd., Mindtronic AI, NeuinX, Neurobit Technologies Co., Ltd., PanelSemi, and Quantum Music Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>CES Innovation Award winners cover the gamut of tech innovation ranging from digital twins for health IoT to products and services such as cancer tests to sports analysis and observation.</p>

<p>“We had a startup from Tsinghua University that used AI to observe an athlete\'s performance in sports like basketball. They can analyze basketballs going into the hoop to make analysis more entertaining and useful for player training,” said Hsu.</p>

<p>She added that given the size of the U.S. sports industry, there are lots of investment opportunities should companies develop real-time sports analysis.</p>

<p>Another firm which attracted investor attention was CytoAurora, which was attempting to create a “Liquid Biopsy” that could integrate biomedicine and technology.</p>

<p>Medicine has been on the mind of many given the three years of the pandemic. “After COVID we realized that keeping our medical operations normal is important. Many are asking how to apply IT to medical use as there are lots of mature products that can help doctors better diagnose patients and do better treatment,” said Hsu.</p>

For example, the NSTC awards grants to Taiwanese researchers to study in a variety of different fields at Stanford University through several talent cultivation programs such as the SPARK Program, the Stanford-Taiwan Biomedical Fellowship Program (STB), and the Stanford-Taiwan Social Science Fellowship Program (STSS). In addition, the NSTC provides academic research experience to doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows through the Graduate Students/Postdoctoral Study Abroad Program and the Dragon Gate Program to Stanford University.</p>

<p>The NSTC also coordinates cross-ministry and cross-discipline programs and allocates relevant resources. For this reason, the NSTC has integrated existing programs into the Taiwan S&amp;T Hub, and the hub will support talent cultivation, conducts international exchanges. This platform will allow relevant programs to connect abroad, enhance cross-discipline academic capacities, and demonstrate the impact of Taiwan\'s tech power internationally.</p>

<h2>Top scientists from the US onboard to help the Hub</h2>

<p>During the press conference, the co-chair of the Hub Ying-Chih Chang introduced the main functions and goals of it. Subsequently, Faculty Executive Board Member Professor Philip Wong shared his views on new opportunities for Taiwan-US semiconductor cooperation. Finally, Scientific Advisor and UC Berkeley School of Public Health Dean Michael Lu discussed deepening cooperation between Taiwan and the US in public health during the post-pandemic era.</p>

<p>Key members of the Hub, who have extensive experience in cross-discipline coordination, possess forward-looking insight into the future of the cooperation between Taiwan and the US in critical fields such as scientific research, semiconductors, and innovation. These members will help link up Taiwanese researchers with important scientific institutions throughout the Bay Area such as Stanford University and UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>During Minister Tsung-Tsong Wu’s remarks, he stated that the Taiwan Science and Technology Hub is an innovative approach to address a larger set of challenges posed by international competition during the post-pandemic era. Wu said that Taiwan needs to make use of its strengths in techonology to create greater synergy.</p>

<p>Wu mentions that the Hub will serve as an important platform for higher education, scientific research, and industry-academia cooperation. In the future, the Hub will enhance Taiwan’s image as an important player in international research by providing opportunities for Taiwan’s scientific community and technological capacities to forge stronger connections with important institutions in the US.</p>

We&#39;re thrilled to have attracted funding from investors that share our vision. With their support, we&#39;re better equipped than ever to onboard the next billion users to crypto,&quot; said Lee.</p><p>Providing a user-friendly entry point to the world of DeFi, NFTs, GameFi and Web3, Blocto removes typical friction points encountered by industry newcomers. The application has simplified the often-confusing cryptographic key system that is fundamental to transacting with cryptocurrency and designed a more intuitive, chain-agnostic gas fee system.</p><p>With Blocto&#39;s SDK, the Web3 ecosystem strengthens its cross-platform expansion, boosting user acquisition. A 95% conversion rate (20x the industry standard), a less-than-30-second email login process, and a freemium model that simplifies gas fees and transactions all make integrating with Blocto an easy win for developers and projects.</p><p>Despite the lull in the crypto markets, portto remains profitable and user metrics continue to surge. As of November 2022, Blocto has amassed 1.6 million users, and BloctoBay is the most popular non-custodial NFT marketplace on the Flow blockchain. After its recent expansion into the Aptos ecosystem &mdash; as part of its chain-agnostic efforts to drive mass adoption across multiple networks &mdash; Blocto has quickly established itself as the second largest Aptos wallet with more than 400,000 users.</p><p>&quot;Blockchain is an attractive emerging market that, similar to the internet back in the &#39;90s, is here to stay. Although we can see the full potential of blockchain technology, the main key to mass adoption is an easy user onboarding experience &mdash; something that Blocto provides. This is also why big consumer-facing companies such as Yahoo, MotoGP Ignition, and Gogoro all choose Blocto as their exclusive partner to explore the Web3 world,&quot; said Edwin Yen, co-founder and COO of Blocto.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47885">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47885</a></p>', '640/ebd/f02/640ebdf024627380988012.jpg', 1, '2023-03-13 06:09:44', '2024-09-01 19:26:22', null);

Ye De Wei said that this fundraising is to allow PackAge+ to develop diversified business models and focus on the development of more circular service application scenarios, such as sharing return stations with circular cups, circular lunch boxes, and other circular startups, to expand the energy of shared circular services.</p><p>Ye De Wei also revealed that PackAge+ is collecting various data points from the circular system to build an AI model that calculates the best recycling route, which means the least carbon footprint. They have also collaborated with a well-known food delivery platform.

In order to reduce packaging waste from the source, the &quot;E-commerce Packaging Reduction Regulations&quot; will be implemented on July 1, 2023. The regulations set targets for the use of circular packaging for businesses with capital over NT$150 million. By 2026, the circular packaging utilization rate should reach 15%, including the four major e-commerce companies MOMO, Eastern Home Shopping &amp; Leisure, PChome, and Shopee, as well as B2C businesses such as food, cosmetics, 3C products, and clothing.</p><p>PackAge+&rsquo;s &ldquo;circulating packaging&rdquo; product can be reused at least 50 times and effectively reduce the waste of disposable packaging when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p><p>It can reduce around 1.2kg of carbon emissions using PackAge+&rsquo;s packaging every time. However, besides the durable eco-friendly packaging, the key to the service is how to establish a perfect circular system from shipping, returning, to recycling and cleaning of the packaging bags.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ea0/abf/b6f/EZJ67ghBaXHtlpmXDwFvNpvIZ0Tb8tdKajQx4QVO.jpg" alt="PackAge+ 配客嘉" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>PackAge+&rsquo;s &ldquo;circulating packaging&rdquo; product can be reused at least 50 times and effectively reduce the waste of disposable packaging when shopping on e-commerce platforms. / Photograph : 配客嘉 提供</p><p>PackAge+ has connected e-commerce platforms, return merchants, and consumers, using the cooperation of e-commerce platforms or return merchants&#39; coupons as a reward for consumers to return packaging. At the same time, it has connected e-commerce platforms and chain stores such as Shopee, Family Mart, and Carrefour. So far, there are 4,500 return stations and 650,000 circular packages in circulation, which is equivalent to reducing about 195,000 kilograms of disposable e-commerce packaging waste.</p><h2>Collaborating with the semiconductor industry</h2><p>In addition to its development in the circular economy and e-commerce fields, PackAge+ has also expanded into the technology industry. In 2023, PackAge+ collaborated with a well-known semiconductor wafer factory to develop &quot;Eco-Circular Boxes&quot; made from the factory&#39;s waste plastic, which will be used for logistics and transportation by their partner suppliers to create a more environmentally friendly supply chain.</p><p>Through this initiative, PackAge+ CEO Ye De Wei expressed his hope to collaborate with more technology manufacturers in the future. Besides using the waste plastic to create circular boxes for internal use, they will also provide these boxes to e-commerce platforms that sell relevant products.</p><p>For example, if a laptop brand sells well on a platform, then the laptop brand can produce its own circular box and provide it to customers through the platform, and it can reduce the brand&#39;s carbon emissions in the Scope 3 category.</p><p>Steve Lin, co-founder of SIC Sustainable Impact Investing, commented, &quot;Most companies today only focus on reducing greenhouse emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, but in reality, 80-95% of their emissions fall under Scope 3.

To fill the talent and technology gap for industries, the government enacted the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals in February 2018, along with amendments to the act in October 2021, to further ease work and residency regulations and improve tax and social security benefits for overseas professionals who wish to work in Taiwan. Furthermore, the government set up a policy consultation platform in July 2021 to strengthen Taiwan\'s ability to recruit and retain the international talent required for the nation\'s "five plus two" innovative industries and the Six Core Strategic Industries. In January 2023, the Executive Yuan also approved draft amendments to the Immigration Act that would increase incentives for high-quality talent to come and stay in Taiwan, thus creating a friendlier and more effective environment for talent recruitment and retention.
	<br>
	<br><strong>Key actions</strong>
	<br>■ <strong>Relaxing work and visa requirements:</strong> The government is issuing Employment Gold Cards (a four-in-one work permit, resident visa, alien resident certificate and reentry permit) and employment-seeking visas; graduates from the world\'s top universities are exempt from the work requirement of two years\' previous work experience; foreign professionals are exempt from applying for work permits once they have gained permanent residency; and the maximum duration of a work permit for a foreign special professional has been increased to five years.</p>

<p>■ <strong>Relaxing residency requirements:</strong> Foreign professionals, foreign special professionals, and foreign or overseas compatriot students may apply directly for a residency permit if they enter Taiwan visa-free or on a visitor visa, thus simplifying application procedures for working or studying in Taiwan. For foreign professionals applying for permanent residency, their required presence in Taiwan has been changed from a minimum of 183 days per year to an average of 183 days per year. For foreign special professionals applying for permanent residency, their required period of presence has been shortened from five years to three years. For foreigners who have obtained permanent residency, their required presence in Taiwan has been changed from a minimum of 183 days per year to an average of 183 days per year over the last five years.</p>

<p>■ <strong>Improving tax incentives and social protections:&nbsp;</strong>Foreign special professionals coming to Taiwan for the first time will receive special tax exemptions for their first five years of employment, up from three years previously, and can qualify for expanded coverage under the national pension and national health insurance systems.</p>

<p>■ <strong>Relaxing entry and residence restrictions for nationals without household registration:&nbsp;</strong>The required period of presence in Taiwan for nationals without household registration applying for permanent residency has been shortened to five years. The required presence for permanent residents applying for household registration has been shortened from one continuous year to 335 days within one year.</p>

<p>■ <strong>Coordinating intragovernmental measures to recruit and retain talent:&nbsp;</strong>Policy strategies for international talent will focus on employment in the "five plus two" innovative industries, Six Core Strategic Industries and key service industries; strengthen recruitment and retention of personnel such as those demanded by large-scale investment companies, or graduates from the 500 top-ranked universities worldwide; and resolve various issues that professionals face when moving to Taiwan, thus building a better life for foreigners on the island.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('The Intelligent Future of Food', '2023-05-11', '', '<p><strong><em>A handful of Taiwanese entrepreneurs are paving the way forward through a combination of technology and innovation, changing the game for everything from production to delivery.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a buzz of activity inside Taipei Tech Arena, a sports facility partially repurposed into a startup hub, providing first-class office amenities like well-proportioned conference rooms and presentation areas, desks, co-working spaces, and the IT infrastructure needed to launch entrepreneurial dreams.</p>

<p>Inside sits Foodland Ventures, a Taiwan-based Agritech venture capital firm and accelerator dedicated to F&amp;B innovations and farm-to-table solutions. The company believes opportunities in this sector are often overlooked by bigger venture capital funds.</p>

<p>“Taiwan is very strong in technology as well as agriculture,” says Foodland Ventures CEO Victor Chen. “We hope to marry these two skills and bring this to other markets. Taiwan has so many tech talents and a robust farm-to-table system, with many good entrepreneurs who can propose solutions to current problems.”</p>

<p>One lesson learned by the F&amp;B industry during the pandemic is that restaurants need to be more than physical locations. Most restaurants extended their business well beyond the walls of their dining rooms through delivery service and take-out. In fact, 65% of Taiwan’s restaurants still offer food delivery. Many successful eateries have also developed a “brand,” easily identifiable on the internet and attracting online orders that bolster revenues.</p>

<p>Chen posits that a strong brand creates the opportunity for expansion abroad, pointing to the popularity of new Taiwanese franchises in the U.S., such as 85°C Bakery Cafe, Din Tai Fung, and numerous bubble tea shops. These companies perfected their business model in Taiwan before going overseas.</p>

<p>“Taiwan is good at standardizing practices and making food accessible through low prices or what is referred to as CP (cost-performance) value,” says Chen. “Taiwan is also a small geographic area, leading to innovation and quick adaptation to market trends.”</p>

<p>Currently, many of the abovementioned businesses are also implementing new technology. For instance, Din Tai Fung uses a QR code to direct patrons to an ordering platform with assistance provided by waitstaff.</p>

<p>“This form of digital ordering offers better sanitation, as you aren’t touching a common menu anymore,” says Chen. “It’s also better than a shared menu tablet, which needs to be cleaned after each use.” He adds that such orders can be linked to a delivery robot, which can also lead to reduced staffing costs. “Restaurants spend a lot of money when it comes to training new personnel,” he says, stressing the significant time required to teach cash register systems, order delivery processes, and other tasks.</p>

<p>Eliminating such training through online menus and digital payment can lead to big savings. In fact, one Foodland-invested company, DotDot Global, provides an online ordering system where participating restaurants are given printer boxes that print new order tickets. The system even collects payments, eliminating many front-of-house functions and allowing local business owners to compete directly with Uber Eats and Foodpanda.</p>

<p>Another Foodland investee, Kabob, offers platform-level management of digital menus, online ordering, and inventory and account management. With just a few simple clicks, menus, signage, and displays can be updated to reflect new prices or add new menu items.</p>

<p>“To change the menu in a store or throughout the entire network takes less training and manpower now,” says Chen. “It is all interconnected digital signage and digital ordering. We want to offer SaaS [Software as a Service] solutions that are modularized and interconnected, and all based upon software and computer technology.”</p>

<p><strong>Innovations at the source</strong></p>

<p>While many food businesses benefit from innovations, they also face challenges from the impact of climate change. Drought-like conditions have already displaced rice planting in central and southern Taiwan this year, and other agricultural industries may also be affected as climate change exacerbates extreme weather.</p>

<p>Taiwan’s aquaculture industry is now suffering from seasonality, or differing temperate conditions, which can affect the growth of fish, shrimp, and mollusks. Chen says neighboring Southeast Asia is faring better, as it’s not only more competitive in terms of weather but also labor costs.</p>

<p>Foodland’s biggest investment success is ID Water, which uses IOP sensors to test water quality for shrimp breeding pools. The company implements IoT solutions such as underwater cameras, sensors, and other equipment for real-time monitoring to solve water quality problems.</p>

<p>After developing a simple and cost-effective solution to maintain ideal shrimp breeding conditions, ID Water was able to export its technology to Thailand. The technology also helps cut down on pesticides and chemicals once needed to keep shrimp ponds clean and free of dreaded parasites.</p>

<p>As many countries move toward intensive agricultural practices due to limited land availability, more parasites and disease will inevitably affect crops and livestock. This problem is especially prevalent in Taiwan.</p>

<p>“We have lots of biodiversity because of our year-round temperate climate, but this also leads to a lot of pests,” says Chen. “There are many pests that need to be controlled throughout the year. Many entrepreneurs are trying to pinpoint how to combat these pests in an economical way.”</p>

<p>Many are turning to technology and automation to help battle the problem. Technological solutions also help alleviate shortages caused by skyrocketing labor costs and a decreased interest in physically demanding agricultural work.</p>

<p>“One entrepreneur notified us that there is now a shortage of drone pilots,” notes Chen. “They are highly in demand in the agriculture sector, which is now using drones to apply pesticides. Traditional applications – a person spraying a field, for example – wastes 70-80% of pesticides as they are blown away by the wind. “With drones, downward wind caused by propellers allows for a more efficient application of pesticides.”</p>

<p><strong>New, flavorful experiences</strong></p>

<p>Across from Yongkang Park in central Taipei sits a sleek, futuristic restaurant with a new take on dining. At Space Bao, the ingredients are just as futuristic as the ordering and payment methods, which are done on a large touchscreen monitor at the front of the store.</p>

<p>Space Bao has already won over many netizens eager to gain a glimpse of future dining experiences. The restaurant serves vegetarian food with a modern twist on traditional pan-fried buns. Space Bao’s buns are made from a meat alternative infused with PhytoFat, a source of plant-derived fat, and available in innovative new flavors, including corn soup and Szechuan pepper.</p>

<p>Alternative protein is a growing segment that’s gained considerable hype for being healthier and having a smaller impact on the environment. One company that’s gained from the increased interest is Lypid, a Taiwanese startup focused on driving innovation in the food industry and the creator of PhytoFat.</p>

<p>As a self-proclaimed “foodie, food addict, and avid cook,” Lypid co-founder Michelle Lee is passionate about making a difference through her work in food innovation. Her goal is to have a positive impact on the world by creating new and exciting food products that push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

<p>Lee has dedicated much of her life to food science, first joining National Taiwan University’s Food Science Department before attending Ohio State University and then earning a Ph.D. at Cornell University. She later went to work for heavyweights in the food industry, such as Nescafé and Nestlé. Her specialization in micro-encapsulation technology, which she says is “basically adding a coating to fats so they don’t dissolve easily, increasing bioavailability of active ingredients,” inspired her to create PhytoFat.</p>

<p>Previous incarnations of plant-based meats used coconut oil, which melts and leaks out of the product easily. Lee’s innovation mimics real animal tissue and helps plant-based meat retain fat throughout the cooking process. Her innovations aim to make vegetarian foods on par with – if not tastier than – meat dishes like hamburger patties or high-quality steaks.</p>

<p>“At the moment, about 40% of a burger is fat,” she says. “This has been overlooked in many plant-based meats. Our solution is PhytoFat, which is like animal tissue and has better flavor delivery with 33% less calories and zero cholesterol.”</p>

<p>Lee’s work earned her an invitation to the UN’s COP27 climate conference, where she delivered a speech about how food production contributes to climate change. Around 30% of global carbon emissions, water use, and land use are associated with food production. Greening this production chain can bring great benefits to everyone, she stresses.</p>

<p>Lee believes there’s a big market for her innovation. Alternative meat represents only 2% of the sliced meat market, and Lee notes a substantial potential for growth, especially due to the contributions of flexitarians who eat meat but prefer plant-based items.</p>

<p>“We are working with Louisa Coffee and their 500-plus stores, which offer six different products and flavors,” she says. “This partnership is growing and has inspired us to offer other products that target Asian cuisine, like steamed buns.” Lee’s company is already working on making the world’s first plant-based pork belly.</p>

<p>Another business using technology to cater to consumer needs is Bean Friends Forever (bff), co-founded by Samson Huang. His company is a coffee subscription service that predicts a customer’s taste profile through an introductory questionnaire.</p>
<figure>
	<br><img src="/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1684228065637.jpeg" alt="" width="402" height="600" srcset="https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF3-1.jpg 536w, https://topics.amcham.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IF3-1-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success"></figure>

<p>“Our questionnaire is the secret sauce for our business,” says Huang. He says that asking just six questions can accurately predict what type of coffee a customer likes. Anything more can be overkill, and fewer questions would make customers feel the quiz is too superficial.</p>

<p>The questions asked by bff are quite common, even bordering on banal. They include “where do you shop,” “what desserts do you like,” “what kind of coffee flavor do you like,” and “where do you buy coffee?” As it turns out, these questions have a statistical significance that can help predict a person’s flavor profile.</p>

<p>After answering the questions and receiving a personalized flavor profile, customers are invited to purchase an initial shipment of single-use drip coffee packets for around NT$420 (US$12). Flavor notes and reviews from local baristas are attached to the packaging.</p>

<p>Bff currently has 1,000 subscribers after doubling in 2022. Aside from individual customers, the company also services offices and restaurants. “We don’t have a membership fee as we are totally based on frequency of orders,” says Huang. “Typically, a customer gets a new order every six weeks. Sometimes the contents are like a mystery box as they don’t know beforehand what’s inside.”</p>

<p>Huang attributes some of the company’s success to its collaborations with numerous independent roasters, including those who roast in small quantities and want to impart their extensive knowledge of coffee to friends and fellow baristas. “We often sell our coffee to high-end restaurants, who appreciate our quality because the coffee at the end of the meal has to be quite good,” he adds.</p>

<p>Huang doesn’t operate a physical store. He attends fairs and uses Google ads and search engine optimization to promote his business. So far his team is quite small, with fewer than 10 people actively promoting the company on social media and its website by sharing a few stories each week. Huang believes his highly focused, niche business model, which allows consumers to access exactly what they want at a competitive price, will play a prominent role in the future of retail.</p>

One out of four taxis in Taiwan is from 55688, which is a formidable competitor in the field. &ldquo;Uber entered Taiwan in 2013, however, the number of our drivers has been growing since then; In 2017, LINE TAXI also entered the market, but the number of taxi hailing tasks at 55688 has grown even faster.&rdquo; said Lin.</p><p>Facing fierce competition in taxi business, as a traditional company with a long history, 55688 has been dedicated to digital transformation with ⅕ of its annual budget invested in the internal technology department. For instance, 29 digital payment options are available at 55688. The determination to transform drew the attention of Headline Asia, one of the biggest technology-focused VC headquartered in Tokyo.</p><p>In 2022, 55688 announced that Headline Asia had invested US$5M to help 55688 to expand more services for their 6.8 million users. &ldquo;I can see a huge potential of 55688,&rdquo; said the partner of Headline Asia Joseph Huang, &ldquo;People only perceive 55688 as a ride-hailing platform, in fact, the app has become one of the best in lifestyle service sector and there is much more services closely related to users&rsquo; daily life that we can develop.&rdquo;</p><h2>The key to success - innovation - optimization of the ride-hailing process for drunk passengers and valentines</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ca3/57e/f84/KPTd2V8ArW9W1R9hlHgroYF1tHNSusnMpO5Oyk2L.jpg" alt="台灣大車隊APP" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>55688 is now a lifestyle-focused app that includes more services such as dry cleaning and housekeeping besides ride-hailing. / Photograph : 台灣大車隊</p><p>As both the target audience and operator of 55688, Lin always pays attention to all the unmet customer needs.</p><p>For instance, Lin once found that the page design of designated driving services is too complicated to understand, especially when people are tipsy, leading to the optimization of page design. Now, when we go to the page of designated driving services, the system will automatically propose the most likely options that a user would prefer by analyzing their data of user behaviors, simplifying and optimizing the process.</p><p>Besides, 55688 also launched a &ldquo;life secretary&rdquo; service before Valentine&rsquo;s day, which was ideated by the marketing and e-commerce manager at 55688, Huei-Jhen Yang. Through this service, users can reserve a taxi with flowers and chocolate inside and decorated with customized photos and messages.</p><p>This special service provided only 10 seats, which were sold out immediately after the launch. Thanks to the huge success, 55688 is planning to offer more diverse services for different festivals and important moments in life.</p><h2>The key to success - audacity and decisiveness - launch new service in 1 day</h2><p>Last year (2022), China decided to stop importing fruits from Taiwan, causing severe and negative impact on fruit farmers in Taiwan.</p><p>The digital transformation consultant for fruit farmers in south Taiwan, Yao-Kuan Huang, was struggling to find the new buyers of the fruits that were supposed to be imported in China. In the depth of despair, he contacted Lin through the introduction by the secretary of the director of information office of Kaohsiung city.</p><p>After understanding the request, Lin agreed to help solve this problem and instantly organized a temporary team to support the fruit farmers. In less than a day, the fruits products were launched on 55688.</p><p>Moreover, Lin even provided coupons for ride-hailing to attract more customers to buy fruits, and the 1000 boxes of fruits were sold out in less than 10 days. This success totally impressed the fruit farmers and broke their stereotype for taxi apps like 55688.</p><h2>The key to success - thoughtfulness - drivers are the most important treasure</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/4b5/486/b66/SCqUOEst6ZOnHVKffgdDAgqPffHs8dlNO9kWe2nU.jpg" alt="台灣大車隊" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>One of the most important business philosophies of 55688 from the previous CEO, Tsun-Tien Lin, is to care for their drivers. &nbsp;/ Photograph : 台灣大車隊提供</p><p>According to the observation from the partner of Headline Asia, Joseph Huang, what makes 55688 outstanding among all the ride-hailing platforms is their care for the drivers. This is also one of the most important business philosophies of 55688 from the previous CEO, Tsun-Tien Lin.</p><p>As the frontline of business, drivers&rsquo; strongly influences users&rsquo; opinons. As a result, 55688 firmly believe that they have to take good care of the drivers before taking care of users. 55688 thus provides not only a wide range of services for drivers such as repairing and car-washing but also some rules such as uniforms and the tidiness in the car.</p><h2>Aiming to become a super APP, 55688 has thrived to innovate.</h2><p>In 2022, the annual revenue of 55688 increased by 24%, proving the ability and potential of the new young CEO. &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ve only utilized 5% of the potential values brought from our large user base,&rdquo; said Lin.</p><p>Lin therefore aims to turn 55688 into a super APP, which provides various lifestyle services such as cleaning and moving. However, how to cooperate with the laborers who are not familiar with digital service and how to provide a consistent and standardized service to customers would be a challenge for 55688, but at the same time, a huge opportunity.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47920">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47920</a></p>', '647/591/70e/64759170edc8a660969130.jpg', 1, '2023-05-30 06:03:35', '2024-09-01 19:22:52', null);

With a surge in pet ownership, the demand for reliable pet care has soared. Fluv fills this void across Asia with its innovative online matchmaking services. Recognized for its excellence, Fluv proudly secured a spot on Forbes&#39; Asia 30 Under 30 list.</p></blockquote><p>More and more Taiwanese are keeping furry friends at home. Hence, pet sitting is becoming a pain point for many owners. Imagine white collars that live alone and keep pets. What are they to do when a week-long business trip comes up? Surely, they will be on tenterhooks if no one was there to look after their furry friends.</p><p>Such a dilemma caught the eye of Candace Chen, the co-founder and CEO of Fluv. When Chen was in the U.S., she had access to a U.S. pet-sitting platform. After she returned to Taiwan, she couldn&#39;t find similar services. To close the gap, Chen founded Fluv, a well-loved pet-sitting platform.</p><p>&ldquo;I have first-hand experience with the hassles of finding the right pet-sitting services. Plus, I&#39;ve seen similar platforms overseas, so I decided to meet up with the team,&quot; said Chen Lijun, the Angel Investor of Fluv, director of B Current Impact Investment, and former VP of Finance at IBM Taiwan.</p><p>Fluv specializes in online pet care matchmaking services. Chen pointed out that &quot;the market size of Taiwan is approximately US$716,000 (NT$22M), on par with Singapore. The Japanese market is 20 times bigger.&rdquo; Clearly, the demand for pet sitting in Asia has not yet been satisfied.</p><p>In May 2023, Forbes released its annual report of Asia 30 Under 30, awarding &ldquo;300 young entrepreneurs, leaders, and trailblazers,&rdquo; who exerted positive influence amid economic uncertainty. Among the list was Fluv, a proud Taiwan-based pet care platform provider.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/257/da6/a24/UbG4GQMKZq3vQQVYUiir5TVccDhPVmzYbSEIYQtM.jpg" alt="毛小愛" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Fluv specializes in pet care services, using an online app to match pet owners with pet sitters. / Photograph : 毛小愛</p><h2>Strictly selected pet sitter and prompt report builds word of mouth</h2><p>Fluv currently provides an array of services catering to different animals, including birds, dogs, cats, rabbits, and rodents. Services include home care, boarding, pet walking, and grooming. Usually, cat owners will choose home care plans, while dog owners mainly opt for boarding services.</p><p>The app is like an Airbnb for pets &ndash; users can see the photos, prices, and animals that each pet sitter specializes in. Home care and pet walking services are provided for clients who are away; therefore, the most vital component is trust. Chen said, &quot;In order to build trust, we invested a great deal of effort in selecting nannies.</p><p>&quot;At first, many could not accept letting strangers into their houses,&rdquo; said Chen. Fluv is very strict in the selection of pet sitters. Those who want to register on the platform must be experienced in animal care with no criminal record. Furthermore, they have to take online training and tests. Out of the initial 5,000 interviewees, only 1,500 passed.</p><p>While similar platforms may require nannies to take one or two photos only, Fluv nannies must take pictures of food consumed and medication taken, as well as photos that show pets playing. Furthermore, nannies are asked to monitor their feces. Clients may also rent pet cameras on the app. Much to the users&rsquo; liking, reviews of the sitter are offered, which further facilitated trust.</p><p>With word of mouth, the number of Fluv users reached more than 60,000. Chen added that the major attraction of the platform is the safety net it offers.</p><p>Within 3 days after services were provided, Fluv would hand out compensation if issues were to arise. Since Fluv services come with insurance, users are further incentivized. Fluv also strives to increase the remuneration for pet sitters. Investor Chen Lijun pointed out, &quot;It is also important that the nanny can fully dedicate to the platform.&rdquo;</p><h2>Expected triple revenue growth</h2><p>So far, the user retention rate of Fluv reached 50%. Chen also revealed that revenue in 2022 would exceed approximately US$325,000 (NT$10M). With border restrictions lifting and international travel booming, the demand for pet sitting is on the rise.</p><p>Revenue in 2023 is expected to triple. Fluv is ready to enter Singapore, &quot;where many single people keep pets,&rdquo; analyzed Chen. Fluv has also approached pet sitter dispatch companies in Japan.</p><p>&quot;In Japan, this profession has long been in practice. The Japanese are willing to accept this idea. The biggest difference is they are used to making reservations for pet sitting services on the phone.&rdquo; Accordingly, the focus of the expansion to Japan will be on digital transformation.</p><p>Looking ahead, Chen announced the plan is to leverage big data for AI-powered pet consulting services. The data includes information on pet breed, gender, and age, which help owners solve their problems through online chatbots.</p><p>Fluv&rsquo;s approach solved existing pain points. &ldquo;Most veterinarians are conservative, which makes data difficult to collect. Furthermore, we pay extra attention to data privacy regulations,&rdquo; said Chen. With AI, Fluv is bound to dole out more agile strategies.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47925">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47925</a></p>', '64a/3db/4ee/64a3db4ee1739087007052.jpg', 1, '2023-07-04 08:43:35', '2024-09-01 19:22:12', null);

The White Paper also called for stricter adherence to the 60-day public notice and comment period for new or revised regulations, increased funding for innovative healthcare treatments, and the adoption of international practice in tendering critical public infrastructure projects.</p><p>In the White Paper&rsquo;s Messages to Washington, AmCham lauded the positive development of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade. The Chamber urged the two governments to establish a clear roadmap on how agreements under the Initiative will be executed and then move forward to negotiate a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. AmCham additionally encouraged the U.S. government to schedule routine visits to Taiwan by high-level U.S. government officials and continue efforts to promote Taiwan&rsquo;s participation in relevant international organizations.<br>In the face of global economic headwinds and cross-Strait uncertainty, a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; mindset will no longer suffice, the White Paper said. AmCham stressed the importance for Taiwan to heighten its efforts to eliminate trade barriers and improve the regulatory system to bolster Taiwan&rsquo;s competitiveness. It also urged the Taiwan and U.S. governments to begin negotiations on a bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement to facilitate trade and two-way investment.</p><p>Noting that only eight of the 102 issues raised in the 2022 White Paper have been resolved, the Chamber expressed the hope of holding more frequent meetings between its committees and the relevant Taiwan government agencies in the coming year.</p><p>At the press conference for the launch of this year&rsquo;s White Paper, AmCham Taiwan thanked the National Development Council for its annual efforts in coordinating the government&rsquo;s response to the Chamber&rsquo;s recommendations, as well as the relevant government ministries and agencies for their cooperation in addressing challenging regulatory issues.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47928">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47928</a></p>', '64a/3dc/643/64a3dc6434748465294267.jpg', 1, '2023-07-04 08:47:34', '2024-09-01 19:21:39', null);

The new service built on its main service online ordering platform, will further perfect user experiences with fast and digital processes.</p></blockquote><p>Dotdot has made a splash since its establishment in 2019 under the leadership of CEO Ting Hsieh. Today, with over 15,000 users, 80 million unique users per month, and a staggering total of 50 million orders, Dotdot&#39;s services have facilitated online financial transactions worth 30 billion. The numbers illustrate an undeniable trend: the era of non-cash payments has arrived, with small-scale eateries increasingly keen to adopt digital solutions. Dotdot positions the product as &ldquo;payment as a service&rdquo;, aiming to boost online payments for all businesses.</p><p>&quot;We have witnessed a changing era. In the last three years, the industry has lost nearly 3,000 employees while gaining 20,000 new establishments. Meanwhile, labor costs have skyrocketed, accounting for nearly 40% of expenses,&quot; said Ting Hsieh, CEO of Dotdot. &quot;We are committed to easing the burden on these small-scale operations, providing a streamlined solution to save them valuable time, improve service, and reduce labor demands.&quot;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/dcf/86a/865/NPBDmud6yqDl2aGcBvOqrWaBPz7JVJOMLv4gFOqx.jpg" alt="點點全球執行長謝瑞庭發表了創新支付服務「點點付 DDPay」" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Dotdot positions the product as &ldquo;payment as a service&rdquo;, aiming to boost online payments for all businesses. /Photograph : 點點全球</p><p>Hsieh pointed out that the time-consuming tasks of taking phone orders and manual billing take up valuable resources for these establishments, thus taking away from their core service - providing delicious food. He believes non-cash payment is the future, and the Dot Dot Payment solution is designed to simplify this transition, offering a complete, one-stop payment service. It supports QR-based payment methods, and contactless transactions, and eliminates the hassle of dealing with multiple third-party payment providers.</p><p>&quot;After payment completion, everything from electronic receipts to loyalty points and carrier services can be handled at one point. We have even integrated services that allow establishments to join the social app LINE members system to help them manage their businesses,&quot; Hsieh added.<br>The new product also promises to resolve one of the major pain points for small businesses &ndash; reconciling accounts. The DDPay solution enables businesses to reconcile their accounts via cloud services, offering a streamlined, unified platform for efficient business operations.</p><p>Bogi Huang, COO of Dotdot, added, &quot;In the wake of the pandemic, even small-scale and single-person food businesses are gradually accepting digital payment methods. Online payments speed up the process compared to traditional order-taking and cash handling. Our Dot Dot Payment solution is poised to usher these establishments into the future of seamless, digital transactions.&quot;</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ec8/6cb/96e/kE8LF6GckrMVU5pP5871aop99ew3K4nIicseCh4s.jpg" alt="點點全球點點付支援信用卡感應支付" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>The DDPay solution enables businesses to reconcile their accounts via cloud services, offering a streamlined, unified platform for efficient business operations. /Photograh : 點點全球</p><p>Dotdot Global&#39;s DDPay service operates through a self-developed interface known as DDUPI, which integrates various online payment channels. The system comprises three core technologies: DDPH for barcodes, DDQR for QR Code scanning, and DDTAP for credit card payments. These are connected through the pre-existing MAP (Member Aggregation Platform) interface, seamlessly integrating features to manage customer membership.</p><p>Joel Tay, CEO of Soft Space, which provides contactless credit card payment technology, shared his insights on Dotdot&#39;s innovative approach. &quot;Dotdot is the first food tech service platform in Taiwan to provide SoftPOS payment application services,&quot; he said, &quot;by utilizing the existing POS machines of businesses and adding contactless credit card payment methods, Dotdot has achieved two major advantages: quick deployment and reduced operational costs. This not only benefits the businesses but also offers consumers a seamless and secure contactless payment experience.&quot;</p><p>Dotdot&#39;s use of innovative tech, like Soft Space&#39;s contactless payment technology, represents a significant step forward in payment solutions. This strategic move towards providing a frictionless experience for both businesses and consumers further solidifies Dotdot&#39;s commitment to harnessing technology to transform the payment landscape.</p><h2>Starting as an online ordering platform, Dotdot thrives out of an &ldquo;accident&rdquo;</h2><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/22c/52b/d9a/A6sMr5lQoGD9k4uc98UaNWWZKNydU48uJ7zHOOQd.jpg" alt="點點全球點點付也支援非餐飲業者的支付" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>The Dotdot team&rsquo;s ability to spot a problem and turn it into an opportunity demonstrates the company&#39;s innovative spirit. /Photograh : 點點全球提供</p><p>The story of Dotdot begins with a simple lunch outing. Bogi Huang and his engineering team found themselves struggling with an overly complicated order machine at a local eatery. This moment sparked the question, &quot;Is it really that hard? Why don&#39;t we just build one ourselves?&quot; This idea birthed the prototype of Dotdot&#39;s global solution. Initially, it started as a side project &ndash; an ordering system that was introduced in May 2019.</p><p>However, in just six months, the number of businesses using their system soared to 4,500, generating a turnover of more than 300 million. The unexpected success inspired Huang to establish a company and focus on nurturing this promising venture.</p><p>Dotdot&rsquo;s solution capitalizes on technology tools that Taiwanese people use most frequently: LINE. Customers only need to add the restaurant&#39;s official LINE account to place orders online. The platform offers an array of choices, allowing customers to choose between pick-up, take-out, or delivery. The system seamlessly integrates with popular online payment methods such as Line Pay, making the process extremely convenient for consumers.</p><p>The Dotdot team&rsquo;s ability to spot a problem and turn it into an opportunity demonstrates the company&#39;s innovative spirit. The journey from an awkward encounter with a lunch ordering machine to the creation of a robust, user-friendly digital platform embodies Dotdot&rsquo;s commitment to improving customer experience. This dedication, coupled with their knack for leveraging existing technologies, has been key in Dotdot&#39;s rapid expansion and success. As the company ventures into the payment solution market, it&rsquo;s clear that its customer-centric, problem-solving ethos will continue to guide its growth.</p><p>〔Original :Meet Global〕<br><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47938">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/47938</a></p>', '64c/710/229/64c710229412f221354899.jpg', 1, '2023-07-31 01:38:44', '2024-09-01 19:21:18', null);

And then, starting from 2024, all companies listed on the TWSE will have to do the same.</p>

<p>To further enhance services for international investors, the TWSE announced the launch of the new <a href="https://esg.twse.com.tw/ESG/front/en/#/main/home">ESG InfoHub</a> and <a href="https://www.twse.com.tw/IIH/en/index">Investment InfoHub – The Taiwan Markets Dashboard</a> to establish a one-stop information service platform, so as to further strengthen the services for international investors. TWSE hopes to improve the information transparency of listed companies, enhance its competitiveness among international markets, and continue to attract foreign investment to Taiwan.</p>

<p>This year, Taiwan\'s capital market has shown tremendous strength with resilient fundamentals, high dividend returns, and a complete upstream and downstream supply chain in information and communication technology (ICT) industry. The recent AI frenzy, together with the expected end to US rate hikes, has attracted the foreign capital flow to return to Taiwan\'s stock market. So far in 2023, the proportion of foreign capital in Taiwan stocks exceeded 40%, which has driven up stock prices in Taiwan. According to data from TWSE, as of June 30, Taiwan\'s stock market was up 19.65% for the year, ranking fourth among the world\'s major stock markets, and second only to the Japanese stock market 27% among Asian stock markets.</p>

<p>The total revenue of listed companies in Taiwan hit a record high of USD 1.31 trillion in 2022, with an annual growth rate of more than 5%. Judging from the estimated distributable cash for dividends, the estimated dividend yield is close to 5%, ranking among the best in the world. Among the constituent stocks of the Taiwan stock index, listed companies in technology, semiconductors and electronic components have a combined weight of more than 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Optimization of information disclosure with a one-stop service platform</strong></p>

<p>The Investment InfoHub website aims to provide investors with one-stop integrated information services for making investment decisions. It integrates important information from the official website of the TWSE, Market Observation Post System and Market Information System websites. The key information of the markets and listed companies are presented with graphics and visualized analytic reports, providing investors with infographics to facilitate their use in comparison and analysis. In addition, all data reports provide outputs in various file formats such as pictures and tables, allowing investors to further process and utilize the data. By establishing the Investment InfoHub website, TWSE hopes to provide investors, especially foreign institutional investors, with a one-stop access to crucial reference materials needed for making investment decisions.</p>

<p><em>The TWSE\'s Investment InfoHub website offers integrated information services for investors to facilitate their investment decision-making.</em></p>

<p>The ESG InfoHub website integrates ESG information, ESG products and other data from listed companies to make ESG-related information more accessible and useful to investors as an investment reference. Investors may use the platform to look for E (Environment), S (Social), and G (Governance) information of specific companies, and make comparison between companies and across industries to identify the opportunities in the ESG market. The launch of ESG InfoHub, which aims to facilitate ESG investment and drives sustainable finance, represents a critical milestone in the TWSE\'s commitment to promoting the ESG ecosystem, making ESG a competitive advantage for Taiwanese companies in the global market and enhancing the international competitiveness of the capital market as a whole.</p>

<p>Adopting the approach of "Taiwan going out, the world coming in”, led by Chairman Sherman Lin, TWSE will arrange a delegation visit to New York, the global financial hub, for overseas roadshows and physical meetings with important institutional investors in September, in addition to their visits to Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Vietnam during the first half of the year. The upcoming visit to New York aims to bolster Taiwan\'s positioning in the international capital market, build long-term relationships and collaboration with major international financial institutions, and attract more foreign investment flow.</p>

<p><strong>Launching new economy industry index to cover four new industry categories</strong></p>

<p>Along with ESG InfoHub and Investment InfoHub, TWSE has also launched several new key measures in July, including adjustments to the industry classification of listed companies by adding four new categories, namely "Digital and Cloud Services" (four companies), "Sports and Leisure" (15 companies), "Green Energy and Environmental Services" (12 companies), and "Household" (11 companies), which allows distinctive listed companies to benefit from a clustering effect and draw the attention of investors. Taking the world\'s largest sports footwear OEM Pou Chen Group and the world\'s leading bicycle manufacturer Giant Group as examples, the two conglomerates, which were originally listed under the "Other" category, will be included in the "Sports and Leisure" industry category starting from July.</p>

<p>In tandem with the above measures, TWSE will also launch the "Taiwan New Economy Industry Index", which covers the listed companies of the four said new industries, as well as the "Taiwan Innovation Board Index" to highlight Taiwan\'s new economy companies.</p>

<p>In addition, the TWSE is set to launch a new Corporate Identification System (CIS) in July since the last update 15 years ago in 2008, the new CIS design aims to convey the importance of innovation highly valued by the TWSE.</p>

	<p>Since the first-ever crowdfunding platform Zeczec was founded in 2012, more than 7,000 projects have generated over ten billion Taiwanese dollars, which is equivalent to 300 million U.S. dollars. Emphasizing creativity and originality, the crowdfunding platform had over 60% of pledged money going to projects featuring original creations such as the world’s first palm-sized laser engraver provider Cubiio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Taiwan’s first crowdfunding platform, Zeczec marked its milestone by pledging over $300 million altogether for 7,000 projects. Quake Hsu, the co-founder of Zeczec, emphasized the platform\'s unwavering commitment to three key pillars: fostering genuine originality, celebrating the richness of Taiwanese cultures, and catalyzing local industries.</p>

<p>“We not only contribute to these three core values in the last decade, but also we would like to level up and speed up market validation for original creativity,” said Hsu. Taking this commitment a step further, Zeczec is launching a subsidiary to directly invest in innovative and original ideas. This strategic move not only underscores the platform’s dedication to nurturing early-stage creativity but also equips budding ideas with the necessary resources and support, aiding them in their growth journey.</p>

<h2>Zeczec: A Global Contender in the Crowdfunding Arena</h2>

<p><img src="https://startup.sme.gov.tw/en/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/1694597041949.jpeg" alt="Global Crowdfunding Platforms " class="fr-fic fr-dii" data-result="success" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Zeczec has pledged over US$300 million within a decade and boasts a success rate of over 78% for its crowdfunding projects, ranking No.1 in project success rate. / Image Credits: Wendy Wu</p>

<p>In the dynamic world of crowdfunding, Zeczec has emerged as a formidable force, not just within Taiwan but on the global stage as well. While platforms like Indiegogo, Kickstarter, and Japan\'s Campfire have long been recognized names in the crowdfunding universe, Zeczec\'s commitment to fostering creativity and originality sets it apart.</p>

<p>The platform has pledged over US$300 million within a decade and boasts a success rate of over 78% for its crowdfunding projects. This high success rate is a testament to its dedication to innovation and its deep-seated belief in the potential of original ideas. While the global crowdfunding giant Kickstarter has seen more than 70 billion dollars pledged and a 39.4% success rate, Japan’s crowdfunding platform, Campfire, has a total pledged amount of over 500 million and a success rate of 26% for projects reaching their funding goals. Indiegogo, which doesn’t disclose its total funded amount, has a success rate of only 9%. The combination of its user-centric approach, robust infrastructure, and keen market insights makes Zeczec a promising contender in the future of crowdfunding.</p>

<p>As Zeczec gears up to challenge the giants in the crowdfunding realm, the company has set ambitious targets for itself. Determined to grow both rapidly and strategically, Zeczec has embarked on an audacious journey to amass its next US$300 million within a span of just three years, targeting 2026. To speed up its crowdfunding pace, Zeczec adopts a strategy of selecting and marketing projects with strong cultural roots.</p>

<h2>Setting off a craze of eco-friendly beverage cups and classic literature, Zeczec becomes a cultural hub</h2>

<p>In an era where ideas transcend borders and innovation knows no bounds, Zeczec stands poised to be a beacon for creators and innovators worldwide. / Image Credits: 嘖嘖</p>

<p>Throughout its journey, Zeczec has been instrumental in propelling numerous products from different industries into the spotlight. The platform\'s impressive success stories speak to its efficacy and impact. Notably, Hiding Tou, marked one of the most supported projects on the platform, has produced the “national beverage cup”. With an initial goal of NT$ 1,000,000, the campaign amassed an astonishing NT$ 38,289,487 from 31,089 supporters, indicating the vast potential and appeal of native Taiwanese products.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Yuan-Liou Publishing, the renowned publishing house, has successfully utilized Zeczec to rejuvenate and reintroduce a series of novels by the legendary Chinese writer Jin Yong, whose works have garnered sales of over 300 million copies globally. In a similar vein, the celebrated “Agatha Christie: The Queen of Crime”, has also been freshly relaunched on the platform.</p>

<p>Traditional Taiwanese industries are witnessing an evolution of business models, with individuals leveraging the platform to foster collaborations, as seen in a collaboration melding 80 years of traditional Japanese craftsmanship with Taiwanese design. This fusion culminated in products that blend Taiwan\'s innovative designs with Japan\'s impeccable manufacturing standards.</p>

<p>Moreover, Zeczec extends its reach beyond Taiwan\'s shores, inviting international talents and brilliant ideas to the island. The platform successfully funded over 1,400 cultural content projects. An English illustrator Tom Parker, through the platform\'s support, was able to complete his illustrative masterpiece, the “Taipei Map.”</p>

Both enterprises (like Google, Microsoft, AWS, IBM and Meta) and startups (like Appier and Gogolook) have been able to find successful business models in Taiwan.</p><p>For example, Google, which has been operating in Taiwan for more than 15 years, has established the largest data center in Asia and continues to expand its operations, collaborating with research centers and universities in Taiwan.</p><p>Additionally, the Taiwan-based artificial intelligence startup, Appier, with AI SaaS as its core service, has successfully gone public in Japan, with an estimated market value of over USD 1.35 billion, demonstrating the promising prospects of Taiwan&#39;s digital industry on the global market.</p><h3>Balancing Work and Life: Achieving Harmony in Taiwan</h3><p>Taiwan is more than just a friendly society but also ranks among the top nations globally in terms of quality of life, healthcare accessibility, freedom of speech, marriage equality, and government efficiency.</p><p>And that has attracted numerous open-source communities and global tech leaders, such as Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, and Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, to become Taiwan Employment Gold Card holders.</p><p>Taiwan is a country known for its rich culture and abundant natural experiences.

<p>Innovation and entrepreneurship are pivotal drivers of Taiwan\'s industrial development and key economic issues of global significance. With the easing of the global pandemic and the alleviation of supply chain bottlenecks, countries worldwide are strategizing to rejuvenate their industrial economies. For many countries, this means enlivening the startup ecosystem through various strategic measures. For example, Japan introduced a five-year entrepreneurship development plan at the end of 2022 while in 2023, South Korea launched a comprehensive entrepreneurship policy. The United States designated 31 technology hubs (Tech Hubs) to foster regional startups and enhance competitiveness. Further, the G20 introduced the Startup20 strategy, encouraging member countries to foster and connect startup development and thereby stimulate global entrepreneurial ecosystem growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, various ministries have actively supported the development of startups, with innovation and entrepreneurship as key approaches to driving economic growth. To strengthen these efforts, entrepreneurship has become a vital part of policy planning via inspiration from international innovation and entrepreneurship support practices. Support for startups is now key among the responsibilities of the Small and Medium Enterprise and Startup Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the goals of accelerating the growth and transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enhancing international competitiveness, and establishing solid partnerships with local and foreign enterprises.</p>

<p><strong>Features and Resources</strong></p>

<p>Taiwanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are known for their flexibility and resilience, and many have become “hidden champions” in the global supply chain. These enterprises often engage in external innovation by collaborating with startups and external teams and by integrating outside resources, ideas, and innovations to drive transformation and upgrading.</p>

<p>Startups in Taiwan are adept at incorporating digital technologies into their business models, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data to assist traditional industries, service sectors, and cultural creative fields in digital transformation. Startups are also crucial for businesses looking to introduce innovative technologies, develop new products, and enter new markets.</p>

<p>To support the development of innovation and entrepreneurship, the government has been conducting foundational courses and activities in this area for many years. Assistance is provided at various stages of entrepreneurship, for example, through platforms such as the startup.sme.gov website and online universities, which enhance entrepreneurial skills. The government encourages large enterprises and industry alliances to invest in the startup ecosystem, funneling cross-sector resources into new ventures. Additionally, international-grade entrepreneurial clusters like Linkou and Yawan Startup Terraces were established to attract more international startups. These initiatives, alongside innovation research grants and supply chain integration, aim to enhance the innovation value of industries.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination and Collaboration<br></strong></p>

<p>Developments in emerging technologies such as generative AI, sustainable fuels, sustainable computing, flexible soft batteries, and sensors, are driving changes in industries like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, aviation, shipping, and agriculture. The entrepreneurial projects of these startups are diverse, often involving cross-industry and emerging domain issues. These startups &nbsp;face various entry barriers, including financial, regulatory, and experimental challenges, thereby requiring support from sectors such as government, industry, academia, and research. This collaboration creates opportunities for cooperation.</p>

<p>To support economic growth and enhance competitiveness, government ministries must actively participate and offer support. Through inter-ministerial communication and coordination, emerging industry issues can be addressed, and industry barriers reduced. The development of startups requires the joint assistance of the government, incubation organizations, venture capitalists, and research centers. Let\'s work together to contribute to innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p>In the constantly changing world of mobile gaming, Elkroom has made its mark with the OXO Game Launcher, now a top-ranked game launcher on the Android platform with over six million installations. Co-founded by Ethan Fu and Kate Liao, Elkroom originated as a side project. Their combined experience in app development and a shared passion for gaming led to the creation of OXO Game Launcher, which recently updated with its AI feature, automatically capturing best moments of gameplay and enabling gamers to share.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Mobile gaming, increasingly a primary source of entertainment, often faces issues like lag, intrusive notifications, and stuttering gameplay, which can spoil the fun. Elkroom, co-founded by avid gamer Ethan Fu, steps in with a solution to these problems.</p>

	<p>Fu, CEO of Elkroom, was inspired by solutions such as Samsung\'s Game Launcher, aimed at optimizing the mobile gaming experience. "Samsung\'s feature made me a loyal user," Fu remarks. However, he recognized a gap in the market: brand-specific optimizations. Major players like Samsung and Xiaomi offer game launchers, but these are confined to their respective ecosystems, leaving many gamers without optimization options.</p>

	<p>Fu\'s passion for gaming led him to develop the OXO Game Launcher, which transcends the basic designs of existing accelerators by focusing on sophistication and community engagement. Elkroom\'s OXO is universally accessible, catering to various mobile brands, and integrates strengths from different platforms to enhance gaming performance and foster community among gamers.</p>

	<p>In just three years, the OXO Game Launcher has built an impressive user base, with over 5.5 million downloads globally. Its rapid growth highlights the demand for a more inclusive, brand-neutral tool that enhances the gaming experience across a wide range of mobile devices.</p>

	<p>Moreover, the launcher recently updated with its new AI\'s highlight editing feature, which automatically picks out the best moments from gamers\'gameplay. The 1-minute highlight reel out of a 30-mintute video game allows gamers to memorize their MVP moments, and to share on social media with one click. Elkroom continues to facilitate gamer experience as an multipurpose tool.</p>

	<p>As Elkroom continues to grow and evolve, its journey reflects a deeper understanding of mobile gamers\' pain points and a commitment to addressing them innovatively and inclusively. With OXO Game Launcher, Elkroom isn\'t just optimizing games; it\'s building a community for gamers.</p>

	<h3>The Birth of Elkroom: A side project turned game changer</h3><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2023-10/img-1698396087-78279.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="Elkroom團隊" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div>

	<p>
		<br>
	</p>

	<p>The inception of Elkroom was not intended to disrupt the mobile gaming world. Ethan Fu, Kate Liao, and David Chen started Elkroom as a side project, driven by convenience and a shared love for gaming and technology.</p>

	<p>Fu\'s rich background in app development, including his contributions to popular apps like Clean Master and CM Security at Cheetah Mobile and Trend Micro, laid the groundwork for his entrepreneurial journey. During his master\'s degree, he began experimenting with product development, finding the process intriguing.</p>

	<p>Fu and Liao, who met at Cheetah Mobile and shared a passion for animation and gaming, discussed starting a venture together. Liao, a New York-based designer, had a wealth of ideas and a strong desire to innovate in the gaming field.</p>

	<p>David Chen, who later became Elkroom\'s CTO, met Fu at Trend Micro. Over six years, they bonded through daily gaming sessions and discussions about technology and innovation. Their collaboration, fueled by their mutual love for games and David\'s technical skills, formed the basis for their successful partnership.</p>

	<p>As the trio worked on their side project, they realized its potential. Serious development discussions began in October 2019, leading to the app\'s launch in February 2020. Focusing on AI development and an iOS version emphasizing social interaction, they aimed to create a product that went beyond gaming to cultivate a community. The game launcher quickly gained one million downloads in its first year, prompting the team to commit full-time to the project.</p>

	<p>In the lush, misty hills of Yangmingshan, I find Andrew Hall, the founder of Paka Electric, surrounded by a jumble of vehicle parts and accessories in his mud-splattered van. It\'s a scene of organized chaos, a testament to the countless trials and tests he\'s conducted in his quest to perfect his latest prototype. With hands-on dedication, Hall is assembling what he believes to be not just another motorbike but a new chapter in outdoor adventure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paka Electric, a startup working on electric motorbikes, is spearheaded by Hall, whose diverse background includes work with UN Habitat and World Bicycle Relief. Central to Paka Electric\'s design is the Pakalot system, an innovation born out of Hall\'s commitment to utility and inclusivity. This system’s open-source nature is an invitation – a call to bikers, tinkerers, and dreamers to join in and add their innovations to their demands.</p>

<p>But what\'s most striking about this motorbike is its cargo system, cleverly integrated into the frame. This isn\'t a proprietary, lock-you-in kind of design; it\'s straightforward, using standard strut channel components you can find in any local hardware store, which allows you to attach just about any accessory anywhere on the bike. Hall presented to us how quick and easy to assemble the additional seats and storage baskets with his own hands.</p>

<p>“As a family or as a worker, you can make your own motorbikes that fit you the best by adding on these accessories, with no limitation,” said the founder. Hall regards the motorbike as a platform for creativity, where the accessories, much like apps on a smartphone, are developed and shared within the community.</p>

<h3>From Kenya to Taiwan: Andrew Hall is a veteran in the bicycle industry</h3>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-02/img-1708055440-17788.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="Paka Electric" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>In Taiwan, Hall discovered not just the high-quality bicycle manufacturing that the island is known for, but also a community eager to embrace innovation. &nbsp;/ Image Credits: Wend Wu</p>

<p>Andrew Hall\'s journey to founding Paka Electric took a pivotal turn during his tenure in Kenya with World Bicycle Relief. For a decade, this American immersed himself in creating heavy-duty, affordable vehicles in Kenya, a role that deeply influenced his approach to product design and development. His time with World Bicycle Relief as a Product Manager and in Operations in Kisumu, Kenya, from April 2010 to August 2016, laid the foundation for his future endeavors.</p>

<p>The experience in Kenya, dealing with commercial vehicles and heavy-duty tools, led Hall to a pivotal moment in his career: a transition to product development in Taiwan for the same company. It was in Taiwan, particularly in Taichung, that Hall discovered the high quality of bicycle manufacturing, a revelation that steered his path towards the creation of Paka Electric.</p>

<p>“As a guy who spent a decade in the bicycle industry, it’s always nice to be close to the supply chain, so here I am,” said Hall. In Taiwan, Hall discovered not just the high-quality bicycle manufacturing that the island is known for, but also a community eager to embrace innovation. Taiwan proved to be a fertile ground for Hall\'s vision. He found a community eager to participate in trials, early adopters who were influential in sectors like farming. This initial support was crucial, providing Hall with immediate feedback and a real-world testing ground for his prototypes. The Taiwanese customers, with their specific needs like carrying heavy loads over significant distances, shaped the development of Paka Electric\'s motorbikes. Hall designed them to be robust, with a 20kg battery capacity and a range of 45-60 kilometers, ideal for applications like last-mile deliveries.</p>

<p>What made Taiwan an even more appealing base for Hall and Paka Electric was the welcoming business environment. Hall and his family felt embraced by the local culture. The ease of interaction, the openness of small shops to new ideas, and their willingness to experiment were invaluable to a startup like Paka Electric.</p>

This vehicle is designed to hit the sweet spot for the American outdoors market. / Image Credits: Paka Electric

	<p>Paka Electric\'s entry into the US market is more than just a business move; it\'s a response to a significant need. Over 150 million Americans - encompassing farmers, hunters, park rangers, land managers, law enforcement, and outdoor adventurers - make the outdoors their workplace and playground. For these individuals, the outdoors is not just a setting; it\'s an integral part of their daily life. However, their needs for outdoor transportation have long been underserved, with existing options falling short in various ways.</p>

	<p>In the US market, the challenge is to provide transportation that\'s capable, safe, and affordable. Traditional four-wheeled vehicles, although robust, are often expensive, too bulky for narrow trails, noisy, polluting, and complex to maintain, often requiring a dedicated trailer. Conversely, two-wheeled options like scooters, minibikes, and dirt bikes, though more accessible, have their own drawbacks. They typically produce noise and pollution, lack sufficient cargo capacity, have fixed seat heights resulting in discomfort, struggle on rough terrain, have limited ground clearance, and cannot pull trailers.</p>

	<p>Paka Electric\'s Trusty Trucker. This vehicle is designed to hit the sweet spot for the American outdoors market. It stands out as a friendly, clean, and quiet alternative that is adept at conquering challenging terrains. The Trusty Trucker addresses all the pain points of existing outdoor transportation options. It\'s designed to be robust yet flexible, capable of handling various terrains while providing enough cargo capacity for different needs. Its design considers the rider\'s comfort and safety, making it suitable for extended use in varied outdoor conditions. But what really sets the Trusty Trucker apart is its affordability. It\'s not just about being just another option; it\'s about being the "Just Right" option.</p>

<p>Many remote workers now find themselves in need of “private” spaces that allow them to do everything from participate in conference calls, podcasts or live streams, or conduct informal meetings. Furthermore, internet technology is making the booking and payment of such facilities seamless, with new bookings processed in less than one minute.</p>

<p>“Our most popular spaces are in high-traffic areas such as Nanjing Fuxing, across from a nearby MRT station. Many people need to find quiet and convenient spaces to meet in private," said Happ. co-founder and Chief Business Officer Chang Wen-hsin (張文馨).</p>

<p>Happ. operates 300 spaces in the Taipei area, 11 in Taichung, and nine in Tainan. There are plans to expand across all of the major cities in Taiwan.</p>

<h2><strong>Cozy private space</strong></h2>

<p>“Rather than meeting at a coffee shop, Chang says, “some people opt for their space when sensitive information cannot be discussed in public or when the individuals involved may be easily recognizable to the public.”</p>

<p>“Many people will rent our spaces for things like tutoring lessons, therapy sessions, or simply for friends to get together after a day of shopping,” she added.</p>

<p>Chang explained that the rental process is simple and streamlined, with users choosing different spaces from a map with detailed images of the interior, including a list of furnishings, and after making a payment online, a numbered passcode is sent to their phone right away.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the location, one simply enters the passcode into an electronic panel on the door, which opens and provides access to amenities such as a table, chairs, whiteboard, extension cords, projector, and WiFi. Each room is cleaned shortly after use, and occupants are encouraged to keep rooms clean and leave with their garbage to be deposited in bins located in the hallway.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" alt="Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan" src="https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708072124-65cf1cbc3408d.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">

<p>The COVID pandemic led more companies to experiment with remote working, creating new opportunities and new work models that broke traditional geographical boundaries. Chang said the main users are typically tech-savvy young people aged 20–40, though her company is making inroads into older demographic groups who may use the service to book rooms for gatherings with friends and family.</p>

<p>“Aside from giving workers more freedom to choose to work from home during the pandemic, it also allowed companies to save on business rent and create a lean and efficient business culture. It also showed that office work does not need to be confined to office buildings.”</p>

<p>Chang said start-ups were the first organizations to embrace Happ.’s space-for-hire business model, followed by international corporate and tech companies that needed “project offices” for longer periods, such as a few months or a fiscal quarter.</p>

<p>“We learned that workers still like to meet person-to-person, and our company provides this service for companies.”</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" alt="Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan" src="https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708072084-65cf1c94da9c4.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">
	<br>A colorful meeting space near MRT Dongmen station. (Happ. photo)</p>

<h2>Tough times during COVID</h2>

<p>Happ.’s original name, "Treerful,” was inspired by the English term “cheerful,” and the intention was to create a cozy environment with each space consistent in design.</p>

<p>Each newly created room has to pass an internal review process to qualify as an available rental space. While most spaces pass, there are always one or two adjustments that can be made based on suggestions from reviewers. “We have a review process for each room where we take into account things like comfortability, lighting, and other issues.”</p>

<p>This attention to detail has improved the overall experience of Happ.’s users and helped the company rise to the top of the temporary space rental market in Taiwan. The company’s Mandarin name has become synonymous with the service it provides, quite an achievement for a company founded just eight years ago, modeled after a similar space-for-hire company based in Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>Chang admitted there has been a loss of competition in the market, while a large number of companies were unable to weather the challenges brought about by the COVID pandemic. This led to three years of declines in business volume.</p>

<p>This led the company to seek new ways to offer new properties. This led to more partnerships and profit sharing with property owners rather than direct leasing of spaces.</p>

<p>“At the beginning, we just rushed to get the spaces ready in the most cost-effective way. We did this by just leasing many of our spaces from landlords,” said Chang. The company later modified its business model by partnering with property owners, allowing it to grow to more locations, albeit slower, across Taiwan.</p>

<p>The company also experimented with a greater diversity of spaces it offers, such as tiny phone booth-type spaces suited for single people requiring a private space for a conference call in busy urban areas such as Zhongshan Station. Happ. is now offering 16 overnight spaces near Taipei Main Station, which can be used day and night, also providing a short rest service for travelers who need to catch a late-night train or flight.</p>

<p>The overnight option charges just NT$190 (US$6) per hour; it’s an affordable option for those who require a few hours of rest rather than a full day of amenities provided by a typical hotel.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" alt="Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan" src="https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708071878-65cf1bc6f1394.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">

<h2><strong>Making it happen</strong></h2>

<p>The backbone of Happ. is an IT system that automates everything from space registration to payment to consumer contact. Chang says all of the software has been developed by company co-founder Jimmy Huang, who has a software engineering background.</p>

<p>While much of the company’s operations are automated, there is no escaping the fact that human labor is often involved in the cleaning and maintenance of each space for hire.</p>

<p>“For our industry, it’s a major accomplishment if we can automate more than 50% of our operations. We need to clean some of the rooms three times a day as our costs are not as cheap as some people may think.”</p>

<p>Another downside of this emerging industry in Taiwan is the number of platforms offered by competitors such as Pickone. “After we started the brand, many other operators have learned how to do this business from us,” said Chang.</p>

<p>In East Asia, two leading brands in the space industry are Spacemarket and Instabase, both of which are publicly listed space rental platforms in Japan. They offer a variety of spaces for activities like birthday parties, photography, and meetings. Their business model involves charging transaction fees.</p>

<p>In response to a growing demand for small conference call meeting spaces in some business districts, one innovation that Happ. began to offer workbooths, which allow a single individual to go into a small space complete with a power source, WiFi, and a door that provides privacy. The phonebooth model was popularized in Japan and can now be found at many JR stations, where they are called “telecubes.”</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" alt="Happ. offers flexible workspaces across Taiwan" src="https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/photos/2024/02/16/1708071819-65cf1b8b7c429.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">
	<br>(Happ. photo)</p>

<p>Chang believes that such innovation is vital for all companies working in this industry segment. “We need to do what we can to provide a good user experience. We need to find out if the space is comfortable. For example, is this desk suitable for work?" Brand differentiation is a big challenge to the company, which is developing a customer loyalty program.</p>

<p>“We have a lot of off-line workers that we depend upon to maintain our spaces and do other duties such as supervise new construction or oversee our interior design.”</p>

<p>Chang said that after being in business for a few years, the company began taking a long, hard look at its corporate image, which included a new corporate logo and a corporate identity pack detailing all of the design specifications for each new space, website design, and other materials.</p>

<p>“It’s now a little bit of a game for us to see what interview on TV or the internet was conducted in one of our spaces,” Chang said.</p>

	<p>Stepping into the office with youthful faces, one wouldn’t imagine that this team, with an average age of under 25, is already experienced in entrepreneurship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rebranded from the former metaverse startup team Metamory, the GitRoll team officially launched in 2024. Feng Ruei Guo (pictured on the right), the co-founder of GitRoll, remarked, " Unlike our past experiences, we\'ve learned the importance of targeting the right market needs."</p>

<p>This time, they are targeting the pain point of "difficulty finding engineers" and releasing an evaluation system that scans through engineers\' code to assess their coding ability.</p>

<p>On one hand, GitRoll assists engineers who possess the ability but are constrained by factors such as their educational background or experience to find a job that matches their abilities. On the other hand, it helps enterprises eliminate unqualified choices and discover undiscovered talent.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-03/img-1711612955-85293.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="Gitroll diagram" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>GitRoll not only assists engineers with capabilities but hindered by factors such as education and experience to find jobs commensurate with their abilities but also aids enterprises in weeding out unsuitable candidates while seeking out undiscovered talent. / Image Credits: GitRoll官網</p>

<h2>Breaking the Academic Job Myth: GitRoll Introduces Programming Proficiency Scanner</h2>

<p>Finding the right engineer quickly is the key for all technology companies and startups. However, besides possessing excellent individual skills, whether a good engineer can effectively integrate into the team and collaborate with other engineers is also crucial.</p>

<p>GitRoll co-founder Cho Hsuan Yu (pictured in the top image) expressed that current enterprises often screen engineer talents based on external factors such as academic qualifications and relevant experiences during engineer recruitment. However, such practices may easily overlook engineers with less impressive diplomas. Additionally, relying solely on programming tests may not accurately reflect the candidate\'s ability to maintain programs.</p>

<p>Recognizing the issues in the current recruitment systems, GitRoll combines the programming expertise of its team members with their backgrounds in enterprise promotion. They aim to develop a coding proficiency assessment system that can \'break down academic barriers\' and help compensate for the deficiencies of existing methods. \'We\'re like what \'Moneyball\' did in the movie; we speak through data rather than experience,\' said Feng Ruei Guo with a smile.</p>

<p>The software engineer talent search engine launched by the GitRoll team categorizes individuals using data, much like \'Moneyball\', challenging the traditional notion that coding ability couldn\'t be quantified and assisting companies in finding suitable candidates.</p>

<h2>Communication is Key: GitRoll Determines Engineer Value Through \'Five Forces\'</h2>

<p>If you\'re using the GitRoll product, all HR needs to do is input the GitHub pages of their engineer candidates, and they can get an analysis of their coding ability within a few minutes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Security: Whether there are any cybersecurity or safety vulnerabilities.</li>
	<li>Reliability: The number of errors (bugs) in the program.</li>
	<li>Maintainability: How easy it is for others to understand and take over.</li>
	<li>Influence: Reputation and status in the community.</li>
	<li>Contribution: Performance and evaluation in collaborating on projects with other engineers online.</li>
</ul>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-03/img-1711378814-14926.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="GitRoll system diagram" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>GitRoll system offers a total of five analytical dimensions, encompassing an emphasis on the core programming skills of security, reliability, and maintainability, as well as the evaluation of engineers\' personal soft skills such as influence and community contribution. / Image Credits: GitRoll官網</p>

<p>In addition to being able to scan individual engineer profiles, the GitRoll system also provides a feature to store scan results. By uniformly comparing the analysis results of applicants with different abilities, it helps to find the candidates that best meet the expectations of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Although the GitRoll system currently only provides assessments of programming abilities and does not fully evaluate soft skills such as communication and collaboration, Feng Ruei Guo shared that the system has sparked enthusiastic discussions within the engineering community since its launch. Not only do engineers actively express their wishes for future functionalities, but also when the team is busy with enterprise development, engineers in the community voluntarily request public code for corrections. \'Because everyone wants to \'play\' with it, it\'s fair to say that the GitRoll system is being driven forward by the engineers themselves,\' said Feng Ruei Guo.</p>

<h2>Becoming Alternative Global Talent Brokers: The Future Path of Startup GitRoll</h2>

<p>The GitRoll team, jokingly referring to themselves as \'alternative international human trafficker\', expressed their future plans to expand beyond building capability scanning systems and move towards the goal of \'engineer headhunting\'.</p>

<p>GitRoll will gradually expand its community influence by launching an engineer database. When companies want to recruit engineers, they can directly search on GitRoll\'s website and filter according to the types of engineers they are looking for.</p>

<p>The team has completed the setting of the screening mechanism algorithm and has been in contact with engineers from different fields to expand the system database. Since its launch in November 2023, the GitRoll system has accumulated data from 5,000 engineers.</p>

<p>Despite being established for less than half a year, the GitRoll team has learned from past entrepreneurial failures. They conducted market research after identifying market problems, confirming market size and product feasibility before delving into software development related to the field. Gradually, they have established a foothold in the relatively overlooked area of coding ability.</p>

<p>With clear corporate goals and a team of aligned members, the next step for the GitRoll team is to venture into the larger U.S. market, which has greater industry demand. They aspire to explore and unearth underrated and buried engineering talents within the Asian community, aiming to build a bridge for them to enter the international market and assist them in pursuing a future where \'abilities speak\'.</p>

INSERT INTO startup_en.ip_ieit_news (title, art_date, tag, content, pic, enabled, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) VALUES ('US Self-Driving Delivery Startup KiwiBot Acquires Taiwanese Startup! Hinting at Shift in Production Focus to Taiwan - What\'s Behind the Move?', '2024-05-21', '', '<p>On April 3rd, the US-based food delivery robot startup Kiwibot announced its acquisition of Taiwanese startup, AUTO Mobility Solutions, specializing in AI-driven self-driving and robot security chip development. The acquisition aims to bolster cybersecurity and foster collaboration in self-driving technology. Additionally, Kiwibot CEO Felipe Chavez (pictured left) revealed in an interview that they are planning to collaborate with renowned Taiwanese electronics manufacturers and shift the robot production supply chain from China to Taiwan.</p>

<h2>Self-Driving Lalamove, Born on Campus: Where Does the Delivery InfoSec Risk Arise?</h2>

<p>In 2017, Kiwibot primarily provided small-scale delivery robot services in closed environments such as university campuses, making it similar to the self-driving version of Uber Eats or Lalamove within campuses. Revenue was mainly derived from delivery fees per order and advertisements displayed on the robots.</p>

<p>Kiwibot\'s robot fleet initially underwent trials at the University of California, Berkeley, continuously refining its sensors, radar, and other self-driving technologies to ensure the safety of autonomous driving on campus. Now, they have manufactured 500 robots, completed over 250,000 deliveries, and launched robot fleets on 30 university campuses across 18 states in the United States and 41 cities globally, including locations in the US, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia. Kiwibot has also decided to expand into spaces such as factories or offices in the future.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2024-04/img-1713238569-76480.jpg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="Kiwibot" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Kiwibot\'s self-driving delivery robots primarily operate in closed environments such as campuses. / Image Credits: Kiwibot Official Website</p>

<p>In fact, Felipe Chavez\'s first entrepreneurial venture, Lulo, was also related to delivery services. As for why he chose campuses as the target market for his second venture, Felipe Chavez explained “We tried different target audiences and scenarios, and eventually concluded that campuses were the most suitable. In the United States, delivery services are quite expensive; ordering delivery on campuses is a luxury expense. Moreover, there is a shortage of delivery personnel, making it nearly impossible for students to use delivery services.”</p>

<p>Felipe Chavez claims that because self-driving robots are connected to the internet and are equipped with multiple sensors and cloud services, along with the trend of sustainability, cybersecurity has become a focal point in Kiwibot\'s recent strategy and is also the key driver behind the merger with AUTO Mobility Solutions.</p>

<h2>Who is the Acquired AUTO Mobility Solutions?</h2>

<p>AUTO Mobility Solutions emerged as an independent entity from ALi Corporation\'s research and development department in 2022. It primarily focuses on developing technologies related to autonomous driving vehicles, indoor obstacle avoidance, robotics, and cybersecurity, along with associated chips. With over 100 patented technologies, this acquisition enables Kiwibot to not only benefit from these patented technologies but also strengthen its control over cybersecurity risks during delivery operations.</p>

<p>AUTO Mobility Solutions CEO, Sming Liao, stated that this acquisition allows AUTO Mobility Solutions\'s technology to be applied in new and innovative ways. Felipe Chavez also mentioned that Kiwibot was originally a customer of AUTO Mobility Solutions, and the merger brings about significant synergies. AUTO Mobility Solutions contributes technological innovation and a portfolio of patents, enhancing Kiwibot\'s cybersecurity strength in AI robotics. Additionally, with operational teams in both Taipei and Shenzhen, AUTO Mobility Solutions\'s presence will help reduce Kiwibot\'s manufacturing and production costs.</p>

<h2>Kiwibot\'s Merger with AUTO Mobility Solutions: Embracing Global Trends and Unveiling Opportunities for Taiwanese Startups</h2>

<p>Kiwibot\'s consecutive acquisitions of Taiwanese startups and collaboration with electronic giants signal a strategic shift in production focus. The motives behind this move are worth pondering.</p>

<p>Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang, who facilitated this acquisition, expressed that besides investing in startups, Headline Asia also aims to deepen collaboration among international startups. From a technological, cybersecurity, and production standpoint, this acquisition is a win-win situation. Considering the current international situation between China and the US, if Kiwibot\'s services intend to enter office spaces such as the US government or banks, they will inevitably have to undergo stricter cybersecurity risk assessments. Given the current supply chain risks, this might not be feasible.</p>

<p><img data-fr-image-pasted="true" src="https://image-cdn.learnin.tw/bnextmedia/image/album/2022-01/img-1641445407-52424.jpeg?w=1200&amp;output=webp" alt="Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p>

<p>Headline Asia partner Joseph Huang believes that cybersecurity is the most pressing issue for everyone right now, especially given the situation between China and the US. / Image Credits: AppWorks</p>

<p>Joseph Huang added that the current situation between China and the US has led more and more companies to relocate their supply chains from China to places like Vietnam and India. Taiwan can capitalize on this trend to step onto the international stage. \'Taiwanese startups possess excellent technology and talent, but often lack understanding of industry issues and usage scenarios. It\'s like having a hammer but not knowing where the nail is, and this is where our VC comes in to assist in solving.’</p>

<p>Joseph Huang stated that in 2022, Kiwibot collaborated with one of the top three food service management companies in the US, Sodexo, to directly address distribution issues. This is a resource that AUTO Mobility Solutions found difficult to access directly. Therefore, through this acquisition, Taiwanese startup technology can have more room for development.</p>

<p>\'Taiwan\'s merger and acquisition culture is not thriving, especially among enterprises. However, looking at the international market, Taiwan actually has many opportunities,\' Joseph Huang said.</p>

This game-changing technology is set to transform business-customer interactions, bringing a whole new level of efficiency and personalized service to the forefront.</p><h2>Interaction with the Client : What Sets BEARVFX Apart from Competitors</h2><p>BEARVFX distinguishes itself by developing virtual humans capable of interacting not just through voice, but also by interpreting facial expressions. Ethan Cheng, CEO and co-founder, elaborates on their innovative approach, aiming to collaborate with restaurants and boutiques. &quot;For instance, in a clothing store, we can customize the avatar to showcase clothing available in the boutique. The background and appearance of the AI avatar can also be tailored,&quot; he explains.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/a68/2a4/c9a/sMwAcXjG0NvwrTjPAgWWl0yiLlOvndNZKI6xPdqK.jpg" alt="BEARVFX - AI Virtual Human Interface" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>BEARVFX - AI Virtual Human Interface / Image Credits: BEARVFX</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re looking to expand into various industries,&quot; Ethan continues. &quot;For instance, a perfume company approached us, questioning whether our virtual customer service should also include the sense of smell. Currently, it doesn&#39;t, but it&#39;s a future possibility. Virtual humans should eventually incorporate all five senses, but we&#39;re taking it step by step.&quot;</p><p>When asked why they prioritize creating highly realistic virtual customer service rather than opting for easier-to-design characters, Ethan Cheng explained, &quot;Human pursuit of beauty knows no bounds. While 2D animations are confined to cartoons, there&#39;s a general preference for realism and aesthetic appeal. Developing realistic virtual humans sets the stage for future 2D innovations. If we begin with 2D, transitioning to realistic designs later would be more challenging.&quot;</p><h2>How Will Emerging Technologies Shape the Future of Marketing?</h2><p>Ethan Cheng, CEO and co-founder of BEARVFX, studied EiMBA at National Taiwan University.

Pepper Hu, CEO and co-founder, highlights their strategic focus: &quot;We aim for natural interaction, not just through voice. Our goal is to create virtual beings that can see you now. If virtual humans had visual capabilities, they could recommend clothing based on what they see you wearing.&quot;</p><p>This approach can greatly improve customer loyalty by offering a human-like interaction that connects emotionally, encouraging repeat visits, and building stronger relationships with the brand. &quot;AI virtual humans also serve as a great way to do data collection,&quot; Ethan explained. &quot;They become offline search engines, collecting and analyzing data.&quot;</p><div data-aid="48068"><h2>Marketing Technology Revolution Expands to Japan and Korea</h2><p>BEARVFX plans to enter the Japanese market, focusing on the catering and clothing industries. They aim to offer virtual customer service and 3D product visualization services to help these sectors cut labor costs and improve customer interactions. Their expansion plans also include South Korea, Singapore, and eventually the US and European markets by 2027.</p><p>Currently, their primary customer is McDonald&#39;s, and they are also partnering with Microsoft and NEC. They are actively fundraising to support their expansion efforts. Pricing for their services varies: customized solutions are more expensive, while standardized options are offered at a more affordable rate. Designing a new character, perhaps inspired by someone specific like your boss or a known figure, will incur higher costs compared to using their pre-made characters. These pre-made characters offer a range of options including faces, hair, and clothing, allowing for personalized branding solutions.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/38d/be8/6ad/OxSmRg7rhpEpsgVdZbc9RqfktjyIr6mn5GARXlQA.jpg" alt="Mc Donald\'s POS machines" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><div data-aid="48068">Currently, touch-screen ordering panels in stores only provide one-way service, but BEARVFX aims to create virtual characters that can completely replace the labor market suffering from worker shortages. /Image Credits: BEARVFX<p><br>They also offer a VIP service. Due to privacy concerns, these AI virtual humans are designed not to remember customers&#39; faces. However, through the VIP service, with the customer&#39;s consent, you can request the AI virtual human to greet special clients differently. For instance, if an important client enters the bank, the AI virtual human recognizes them and offers personalized greetings.</p><p>BEARVFX is revolutionizing customer service with advanced virtual human technology. Envision a future where stepping into McDonald&#39;s means warmly interacting with a virtual assistant that seamlessly understands your needs and emotions, transforming the dining experience.

Ambii Transforms How You Access Healthcare Worldwide', '2024-08-19', null, '<p>Imagine you are a foreigner in Japan, and you suddenly need medical attention. You don&#39;t speak the language, you are unfamiliar with the healthcare system, and you have no idea where to turn. This scenario, all too common for expats and travelers, inspired the creation of Ambii, a startup that is revolutionizing how people access healthcare across borders. Founded in May 2018 by Yuki Taira and Yuji Schuster, Ambii is driven by a singular mission: to make healthcare accessible and seamless for everyone, no matter where they are or where they&#39;re from.</p><p>The idea for Ambii was born from real-life experiences. Yuki Taira the co-founder and CEO, encountered these challenges firsthand when he moved to the United States for university. As a student in Wisconsin, he struggled with English and faced important difficulties when trying to access healthcare. He suffered of food poisoning that left him navigating multiple clinics, battling language barriers, and feeling isolated in a foreign land.</p><p>Yuki Taira discussed about this problem with his international friends and realized taht a lot of them faced the same problem. These experiences created a seed of idea in his mind: a service that would bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers across linguistic and cultural divides.</p><h2>Breaking Language Barriers: Ambii&#39;s Approach to Global Healthcare Access</h2><p>That is why Yuki Taira and Yuji Schuster launched Ambii, a platform designed to assist foreigners in accessing medical care while abroad, particularly if they face language barriers. It allows users to find and book appointments with doctors and offers customizable symptom questionnaires in 14 languages.</p><p>Operating in Japan and Taiwan, Ambii streamlines the healthcare process by directly sharing these translated questionnaires with doctors, reducing paperwork and phone calls, and integrating the information into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) for a smoother experience.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/1de/ea7/f84/1yJV6aM2ODvCE3d88EXx2Tdpc8YLaKBUQ0vdUWep.jpg" alt="Ambii website overlook" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>The website makes it simple to find nearby clinics with English-speaking doctors and see their available schedules. / Image Credits: Ambii website</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/492/039/5ef/ZpNMPTDGAl6fKLPTDVPUf2LKmD5worJ7KUQWcdRZ.jpg" alt="Ambii phone interface" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></p><p>Ambii provides chatbot services to help make accessing healthcare easier for everyone. / Image Credits: Ambii website</p><div data-aid="48079"><h2>Ambii&#39;s Key Partnerships with Taiwanese Healthcare Providers</h2><p>Yuki Taira explains, &ldquo;The system not only saves time but also helps doctors focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks.&rdquo; This innovation has already seen significant success in Japan, where over 100,000 appointments have been made through Ambii. The startup has also expanded into Taiwan, partnering with clinics like Xin Ming Clinic （新明診所）, Dianthus MFM Clinic （禾馨婦產科）, and William&#39;s Clinic ( 康心美婦診所), and is in talks with 15 more clinics to extend their services further.</p><p>Ambii&rsquo;s business model is designed to be simple and patient-friendly. They charge residents a monthly fee and a one-time fee for each appointment, but the clinic covers these costs. This setup helps patients concentrate on their health without stressing over additional expenses.</p><p>Operating in the healthcare industry is not easy, especially in a market as unique as Japan&rsquo;s. Ambii faces the challenge of ensuring that the healthcare providers on their platform maintain high standards of care. To address this, Yuki Taira and his team work closely with clinics to understand their needs and rely on user feedback to continually improve their services.</p><p>Yuki Taira reflects on the cultural differences between Japan and Taiwan and notices &ldquo;Clinics in Taiwan initially didn&rsquo;t use questionnaires, but once they started, they quickly saw the benefits. The appointment system is quite similar to Japan&rsquo;s, which made the transition easier.&rdquo; This adaptability is key to Ambii&rsquo;s strategy as they prepare to expand further into Taiwan and beyond.</p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/c19/a2d/8b0/8t4HmBTfjM972sCQkqIH6XvUlorhW4sb71YYDMNa.jpg" alt="Ambii questionnaire" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;"></div><div data-aid="48079">Ambii&#39;s digital medical questionnaire is available in 14 languages and aims to eliminate communication barriers between foreign patients and medical professionals, reduce misunderstandings caused by language and culture, and help ensure proper medical examinations. / Image Credits: Ambii website</div><div data-aid="48079"><br></div><div data-aid="48079"><p>In a market where trust is key, Ambii is also considering introducing an &quot;Ambii Certificate&quot; for doctors who receive consistently positive feedback, helping to boost the credibility and reliability of their service.</p><p>Looking forward, Ambii plans to expand their services to include phone interpretation, so people can speak with doctors no matter the language. For now, they only offer services in Japanese in Taiwan, but they plan to launch an English service soon. Yuki Taira mentions, &ldquo;Some people are very nervous about going to a clinic and don&rsquo;t want to share their symptoms with friends, so they use translation apps, which isn&rsquo;t convenient.&rdquo;</p><h2>Healthcare for Everyone: How Ambii Breaks Down Barriers with Technology and Culture</h2><p>Ambii believes that healthcare should be easy for everyone, no matter their language, location, or background. Their slogan, &ldquo;Healthcare for Everyone,&rdquo; sums up this mission. By using technology, understanding different cultures, and focusing on patient care, Ambii is more than just a healthcare platform, it&rsquo;s a helping hand for people dealing with the challenges of medical systems abroad.</p><p>As they continues to grow, their focus remains on expanding their services to new regions, improving user experience, and making healthcare as stress-free and accessible as possible. In a world where access to quality healthcare is often hindered by language and cultural barriers, Ambii is breaking down those walls, one appointment at a time.</p><p>Ambii has already made strides in breaking down barriers to healthcare, but their mission doesn&rsquo;t stop there. They remain committed to finding new ways to make healthcare more accessible, ensuring that more people can get the care they need, no matter where they are.</p><div data-sid="Meet_D_Article_bottom_video">〔Original : Meet Global〕</div><div data-sid="Meet_D_Article_bottom_video"><a href="https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48079">https://meet-global.bnext.com.tw/articles/view/48079</a></div></div>', '66c/307/825/66c3078251544092868099.jpg', 1, '2024-08-19 08:53:04', '2024-09-03 20:02:06', null);
