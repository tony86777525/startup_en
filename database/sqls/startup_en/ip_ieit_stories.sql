<p>Scooters have become an inextricable part of Taiwanese culture as they are cheaper than owning cars and their riders can access any point on crowded roads or parking spaces, Wu said in an interview with Business Next Media.</p>
<p>“I wanted to keep the advantageous and convenient aspects of using scooters while solving problems that they cause, such as air pollution and parking scooters randomly, which give off a really, really bad image in the city where we live,” Wu said.</p>
<p>Over three years ago, Wu founded WeMo Scooter in Taipei to encourage the public to choose shared scooters in a nation that has the highest density of motorcycles and scooters in the world.</p>
<p>According to Ministry of Transportation and Communications statistics, Taiwanese use approximately 14 million scooters.</p>
<p>“Scooters powered by fossil fuels produce chemical-laced fumes,” Wu said.</p>
<p>“The emissions are not only affecting our health, but our planet’s health: from our atmosphere to our oceans and even our soil.</p>
<p>“Awareness of chemicals emitting from our vehicles is the first step to reducing them, since it’s every single citizen’s responsibility to make the environment better and not pass down the shabby environment to our next generation.”</p>
<h2>Creating the first scooter-sharing company in Asia</h2>
<p>With the Taiwan government set to ban the sale of gas-fueled scooters in 2035, WeMo went into partnership with KYMCO, a major Taiwanese manufacturer of motorcycles, and in 2016 launched shared electric scooters, which so far are only available in Taipei.</p>
<p>Over 100, 000 people have since downloaded WeMo’s app and become members.</p>
<p>“The WeMo Scooter app is the key to helping riders unlock the scooters,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about forgetting the (physical) key. Once you download the app and join in as a member, the app provides a map identifying the scooters nearby and users can click ‘reservation’ to book their scooters,” Wu said.</p>
<p>“After finishing your (ride), you just need to park the scooter at a ‘legal’ open-air parking area, “ Wu said.</p>
<p>The app requires users not to park their scooters randomly, which helps to reduce parking congestion.</p>
<p>After the rider successfully parks the scooter, he or she clicks “return the scooter” and pays online, Wu said.</p>
<p>Wu told Business Next Media that he wants to make transportation a fun thing to do and wants to organize crossover cooperation with different brands, corporations and local governments.</p>
<p>“We have cooperation with ‘Jimmy,’ a famous Taiwanese illustrator, who designs WeMo scooters to attract the young generation,” Wu said.</p>
<p>WeMo’s users, particularly female ones, like to post scooters with his designs on social media, such as Instagram, Wu said.</p>
<p>“We have to put our utmost effort into finding new things through strategic cooperation and partnerships to make transportation a fun thing,” Wu said.</p>
<p>“It’s important to let our WeMo members truly feel it’s worthwhile to join WeMo as we offer different things,” Wu said.</p>
<p>Wu still noted that technology plays the most important role in his business.</p>
<p>“The technology team of WeMo Scooter has been engaging in upgrading our hardware,” Wu said.</p>
<h2>WeMo’s Future Vision</h2>
<p>Wu, a graduate of New York’s Columbia University, envisions his e-scooter system as a “bedrock” in building a “smart city,” an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information, which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.</p>
<p>Wu, who has also worked for McKinsey and Intel, said he was inspired by speeches made on Columbia&#8217;s campus by technology and investment icons such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.</p>
<p>“I still remembered well those giants’ wise words and how touched I was by their words, which led me become an entrepreneur who wishes to make something different and to create a social impact,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>As such, an environmentally-friendly “smart city” is his vision for the future.</p>
<p>Once the public is broadly in the habit of using shared electric scooters, Wu says he may move into fields involving the collection of air pollution statistics and environmental data.</p>
<p>“Everything involved requires to have a lot of internet-of-things (technologies) to realize this vision, and that’s the next thing I would like to do,” Wu concluded.</p>

<p>MobiX Corp’s <a title="https://www.pcone.com.tw" href="https://www.pcone.com.tw/">Pcone</a>, a platform founded over two years ago by the <a title="https://www.kuobrothers.com/10.php" href="https://www.kuobrothers.com/10.php">KuoBrothers Group</a>, in January attained its first significant round of venture capital financing &#8212; its series A round funding &#8212; of approximately NTD$150 million.</p>
<p>The company has a goal of holding an initial public offering by 2020.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s e-commerce market has grown rapidly over the past few years, with a market size of US$42.69 billion in 2017 according to <a title="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Taiwan-ecommerce" href="https://www.export.gov/article?id=Taiwan-ecommerce">export.gov.</a></p>
<p>Pcone has been successfully recognised as one of the popular e-commerce platform even there are some major players in the Taiwanese e-commerce market, including the <a title="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44028" href="https://meet.bnext.com.tw/intl/articles/view/44028">PChome Online Group. Its platform, PChome24h, offers a 24-hour delivery service with 2 million items</a> that can be shipped directly to customers in 105 countries. Pcone’s competitors also include Singapore’s Sea Group-owned Shopee and Alibaba-owned Lazada Group.</p>
<p>Business Next Media recently sat down with Andy Kuo, CEO of MobiX Corp, and asked him how he pulled off this trick.</p>
<h2>Andy Kuo: the secret of my success is a youthful approach to a market filled with seasoned e-commerce players</h2>
<p>Andy Kuo and his brother, Jerry Kuo, are serial entrepreneurs. Along with their wives, they founded the Kuo Brothers Group.</p>
<p>The group had previously created various online businesses.</p>
<p>One of their more well known ones was Atlaspost.com, which was founded in 2007 and has since closed. It was a social mapping service that helped travelers to connect with people in their vicinity and share content with others all over the world. Later, the website was acquired by America’s Groupon.</p>
<p>His rich experience of running Atlaspost.com helped Kuo to begin thinking about future online business models for Pcone.</p>
<p>Kuo said he had been very flexible in adopting various business models for Pcone and this had contributed to the firm’s success. He was willing to try out anything but would immediately stop adopting a model once it turned out not to be of help for the company.</p>
<p>“I think the advantage that we have is … that our team members are from the younger generation,” Kuo said.</p>
<p>“So as the junior (company), we can mirror the experiences of the senior ones,” he said.</p>
<p>Kuo noted that younger firms don’t need to copy everything the older companies do.</p>
<p>“Many e-commerce platforms announced ambitious plans to expand their markets overseas, however, we don’t have these plans since our market is focused on Taiwan,” Kuo said.</p>
<p>Kuo also says his business strategies relating to stock keeping units play a big part in staying ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>A stock-keeping unit (SKU) is a unique identifier for each distinct product and service that can be purchased on an e-commerce website. The purpose of SKUs is to help a company to systematically track its product availability in warehouses.</p>
<p>Kuo said that Pcone focuses on amassing SKU’s relating to popular lifestyle products, rather than offering SKUs for all product categories as e-commerce companies normally do.</p>
<p>Kuo offers the following advice for would-be entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“Once you find out a solution is not the one you are looking for, then just drop it and try the next.</p>
<p>“You know you will be getting closer to success.”</p>

<p>Director Jack Hsu hopes his blockchain-based token project called SELF can change the way movies are funded and how consumers interact with characters in films.</p>
<p>“We want to create an ecosystem that could really support and promote the Taiwanese film industry,” Hsu said.</p>
<p>“We have been through a constant struggle to get financial support for making Taiwanese films. We understand how difficult that is and wanted to change the environment for the country’s film industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SELF project plans to increase funding success and build an audience around a film project, even before shooting of a film starts, by creating what its marketers call an immersive entertainment digital asset that integrates virtuality and reality.</p>
<p>“The film production’s movie scripts, movie budget and other information will now be released to allow fans to support the film projects they like,” explained Hsu.</p>
<p>Moviegoers and fans will be able to use the SELF tokens to exchange movie tickets, or exchange it for food and drink products at their partnered restaurants and bars in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Hsu added that each time a customer spends SELF tokens he or she gets bonuses and points. This type of engagement with moviegoers shows it is possible to create a positive cycle where aspiring filmmakers receive direct funds from their audiences.</p>
<p>“It offers moviegoers a new way of supporting the movies they love,” Hsu said.</p>
<p>Hsu is testing the SELF project through kickstarting Asia’s first blockchain movie, a film project entitled “The Last Thieves.”</p>
<p>“If the saints don’t die, the thieves won’t stop,” is the slogan of the upcoming film. The film will start shooting in October and is expected to release in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Customers will be able to buy 100 SELF tokens in exchange for one movie ticket which will be available for movie theatres in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The price for SELF token sales is expected to be NT$2.5 for each SELF token.</p>
<p>The SELF team plan to add an interactive game element in the film through use of mobile apps and the internet allowing users and buyers of the SELF tokens to have their own virtual characters in the movie. For instance, if you go to the movie alone, then your character and its outfit may turn into a persona of a lone wolf.</p>
<p>Immersive entertainment has been the project’s core concept. It allows viewers to enter the world that the story creates, to walk where the character walks, to drink where the character drinks, and experience the character&#8217;s emotional ride.</p>
<p>The project was initiated by Hsu in May last year. It has a dedicated team of 20 staff, with an average age of 30, currently based in Taipei. The SELF team plans to start its pre-sale by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Hsu&#8217;s new venture in the intersection of the blockchain world and the filmmaking world speaks to a deep concern about the future of the country&#8217;s film industry.</p>
<p>Taiwanese government support in the entertainment industry is behind China and South Korea, whose pop culture and creative industries have grown in the past several years.</p>
<p>“I hope that I would one day improve the country&#8217;s film industry so that I could stay in Taiwan, and make films with people that I love,” Hsu said.</p>

But conventional methods of detection miss some of the telltale clogs in the brain.</p>
<p>Taiwanese medical technology startup <a title="http://www.neurobittech.com" href="http://www.neurobittech.com/">Neurobit</a> developed Neurospeed in July of 2017 to detect strokes by reading eyeball movement. The company leaders believe this method to be quick and more reliable than the scans typically used today.</p>
<p>Neurospeed is a cranial nerve examination device that analyses involuntary eye movement. Analysis of eye movement can tell within one minute whether someone is showing stroke symptoms, according to a 2013 medical journal report. By 2015 a John Hopkins Hospital neurologist had designed a technique to read eyes for strokes.</p>
<p>The Neurospeed device uses those movements to measure the stability of a patient’s vision. It checks rapid head rotation and looks for any signs of skew deviation, an abnormality when eyeballs are not completely aligned when moving.</p>
<p>This process can sense 90% of stroke-related abnormalities in the brain, Neurobit Chief Executive Travis Yi told Business Next.</p>
<p>CT scans and MRIs are the two most widely used methods for examining strokes today.</p>
<h2>Market for the device</h2>
<p>The company anticipates a product launch next year, followed by a final push for funding as they visit the United States, a major target market, periodically to meet local doctors for feedback.</p>
<p>Neurobit’s founders plan to develop a range of devices that embed the technology for faster screenings. The device will be able to screen for strokes at emergency scenes and in hospitals as well as aboard ambulances.</p>
<p>Eventually consumers may be able to get the devices themselves, including in rural areas. This level of access would help people at risk of strokes do self-checkups.</p>
<h2>A team of students</h2>
<p>Most of the Neurobit founders are students. Chief Technology Officer and the youngest co-founder Jim Huang finished grad school at National Taiwan University, where he researched medical engineering after majoring in biotechnology.</p>
<p>“As students, we only lack experience in linking up with industry,” co-founder Wang Jing-fu said. Neurobit has not yet raised funds, Wang told Business Next, so the founders must solve every issue themselves.</p>
<p>Roger Chen, the only co-founder with industry experience, looks after finances and operations, adding the firm needs greater business finesse to overcome the lack of integration in upstream and downstream medical equipment.</p>

<p>The company’s founder and chief executive officer Johnny Lee said the momentum was continuing in the second half of this year and he expects to report more earnings in the third quarter</p>
<p>“We could grow up to five times more than last year,” Lee said.</p>
<p>iStaging’s surge in revenues is due to technological advances that make it easier and cheaper to use its products.</p>
<p>The eight-year-old company offers virtual reality and augmented reality software solutions and its growth is contingent on widespread adoption of quality headsets.</p>
<p>Thanks to these new technological developments, there are now a growing number of high-resolution stand-alone virtual reality headsets on the market that don&#8217;t require pairing with a phone or computer.</p>
<p>Also, compared with the virtual reality headsets of the past that required a robust computer to function and cost more than US$3,245 (NT$100,000), today an Oculus Go can go for as little as US$209 (NT$6,500.)</p>
<p>Such a dramatic fall in prices means many more people, and not just early adopters, are willing to try out the company’s products.</p>
<p>But it is not just headsets. iStaging has also created VR Maker, software that allows users to create 360 degree virtual tours simply with a fisheye lens ( a very wide-angled lens), a rotator and their smartphone.</p>
<p>The experience can be customized by adding notes, hotspots, tags and more, enabling users to peruse information typically found in real estate catalogues while enjoying their virtual walkthrough of a house or other kind of building.</p>
<h2>Real deep in real estate</h2>
<p>iStaging started out offering augmented and virtual reality solutions for the home buyers, such as taking customers on a virtual tour of a new property or planning a floor layout with an augmented furniture visualization tool.</p>
<p>This is where iStaging derives its Chinese name Zhai zhuang or “home adorner” from. It is the name the business is best known by in Taiwan. With renowned clients like Yung Ching Rehouse Company, they are already cementing their place in the sector.</p>
<p>iStaging’s strategy is to win over the giants of the housing market, Lee said.</p>
<p>He added the solutions they offer are popular among Taiwan’s biggest realtors because the adoption of new technology enhances their image. Lee added that they also have the funds to invest in new equipment.</p>
<p>On top of this, Lee said, through their close collaboration with housing’s big players, iStaging can gain a better understanding of how to best position themselves to take advantage of the industry’s future trends.</p>
<p>Yet, confining itself purely to the real estate sector could limit the company’s potential growth and real estate is not the only industry iStaging has set its sights on.</p>
<p>In future it will not develop hardware or create content, Lee said, and instead develop platforms using technologies that can be used by other industries across the world.</p>

<p>Gyro Systems has built an internet-of-things (IoT) system for the indoor and outdoor tracking of assets owned by businesses such as factories, founder and CEO Yang De-chou told Business Next earlier this year.</p>
<p>The 3-year-old firm’s location tracking setups include indoor positioning systems, outdoor GPS tracking and body gesture control. The overall system keeps track of manufacturing equipment locations, helping factories improve production, Yang said.</p>
<p>Gyro’s mission is to improve safety in work and living environments while raising efficiency of factory production, Yang said. “Our startup provides a real-time view of enterprise clients’ business assets,” he said.</p>
<p>Gyro Systems was founded in 2015 in an office at the Innovation Center of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. The firm specializes in radio frequency technology R&amp;D, in particular wireless tracking and location-based applications.</p>
<p>Business Next was unable to obtain information the number of Gyro’s clients, its sales to date or any funding sources.</p>
<p>The firm employs 17 people, including radio engineers, software developers and hardware engineers.</p>
<h2>Tracking objects via network technology</h2>
<p>Gyro’s Sigfox-GPS Tracker—a rechargeable standalone GPS tracker—is built to help users find a variety of location-specific information. It tracks equipment monitored by network technology developed by the French IoT firm Sigfox, as described in this Meet report.</p>
<p>Sigfox’s GPS tracker works with the Gryo Location app. The system can be used for tracking logistics transactions such as the movement of a company’s vehicles.</p>
<p>A client company’s managers and employees can share data using a Sigfox account. The Gyro-Sigfox system can send alerts when tracked objects leave a safe area as designated by the users.</p>
<p>Gyro signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year with UnaBiz, the exclusive network operator for the French firm Sigfox in Singapore and Taiwan, to develop more applications.</p>
<p>The UnaBiz network is designed to connect IoT sensors and devices. Sigfox’s network competes now with one major rival, LoRa.</p>
<p>According to a survey by Stratistics Market Research Consulting, the global indoor location market was estimated at $5.01 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $52.18 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>Gyro faces competition from Cisco Systems, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Qualcomm Technologies and Geomoby.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese startup stands out as a software-hardware integrator with an edge in hardware manufacturing, Yang said.</p>
<p>“What makes us unique is that in addition to developing location tracking systems and location software algorithms, we also put a lot of resources into designing and making our own hardware devices,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to grow a young business against client demand for customization, Yang said. “But once you build trust and credibility with your clients, most of them are looking forward to establishing a long-term relationship with you,” he said.</p>

<p>Cofounder Sahil Gupta spoke with Business Next earlier this month at the 2018 Computex Taipei trade show. He came to show a prototype of his microphone at a display curated by Taiwan-based <a title="http://www.epoch.org.tw/en" href="http://www.epoch.org.tw/en">Epoch Foundation</a>’s incubation initiative Garage+ Startup Global Program.</p>
<p>The year-old Soundskrit is using sound velocity readings – inspired by the way insects communicate – to design microphone chips for consumer electronics. The chips may be able to recognize speech to a point where the host device can tell who’s talking at a crowded event.</p>
<p>This Q&amp;A with Gupta explains Soundskrit’s origins and plans:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us a bit about yourself and about your role at Soundskrit.</strong></p>
<p>A: I got my bachelor’s and master’s degree in electrical and computer Engineering at Cornell University in upstate New York. I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, and I ended up joining two accelerators prior to joining Soudskrit.</p>
<p>When TandemLaunch, an incubator in Montreal, gave me an offer to join a new project which is now known as Soundskrit, I was very excited. I moved to Montreal from New York and became part of the Soundskrit team. The company was founded in September last year. We currently have a team of four.</p>
<p>Iman Moazzen, who is also with us today, is the cofounder and software lead; Stephane Leahy is the cofounder and hardware lead, and we have a fourth member, Ahmed Abdelaziz from the University of Waterloo, who is in charge of our production.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your featured products?</strong></p>
<p>A: Soundskrit is a Montreal-based tech startup focusing on developing a velocity-based directional microphone to improve speech recognition and sound recording in smart devices.</p>
<p>Professor Ron Miles at Binghamton University in New York has spent many years of research studying the auditory systems of many small insects. What he found was that a lot of insects are actually measuring the velocity of the sound rather than the pressure. Inspired by that idea, he came up with this concept to measure sound in a directional manner.</p>
<p>He invented the core intellectual property of the design of what’s inside the microphone—this idea of how we can make up microphone to pick up the direction of the sound with very good response. We’re taking that as our core concept and building on top of it and trying to commercialize it into a device. We’re looking at applications like video conferencing, virtual conferencing and taking meeting minutes. For example, if you want to take meeting minutes in a conference room, you can imagine using it to track who’s saying what based on where they’re sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s next for Soundskrit?</strong></p>
<p>A: We raised an 800,000 Canadian dollar seed round in December last year. It’s a seed fund raised from TandemLaunch, a Montreal-based incubator that focuses on commercializing research. We’re currently working on our proof of concept process as we’re still in early stages.</p>
<p>By the end of this year, we will have our MEMS (Micro Electrical-Mechanical System) chip on a smaller scale. We will continue to work on our product development, in particular the design of microphone’s mechanical structure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you plan to contract with Taiwanese companies in the future?</strong></p>
<p>A: We’re here in Taiwan because we’re seeing a lot of potential to work with Taiwanese companies. I think Taiwan has a lot of strong companies in manufacturing as well as in personal computer industries. One of the applications we&#8217;re looking at is PCs and laptops.</p>
<p>We think Taiwan is a perfect place for us to understand the current solutions and the current limitations of computer hardware. Thanks to the support from Garage+ Startup Global Program, we have a chance to meet with some of the directors and company executives of professional Taiwanese computer makers like Quanta Computer. It’s great for us because eventually we want to embed our chips into a laptop or a hardware device.</p>
<p>We’re visiting Taiwan for the first time and it’s been an extraordinary experience because you get to have first-hand information of Taiwan’s computer industry.</p>

<p>The firm’s chief marketing officer Séamus Hatch spoke with Business Next during the 2018 Computex Taipei trade show earlier this month. He had come to the show, Asia’s largest of its type, to display the company’s technologies at the booth curated by Taiwan-based Epoch Foundation’s incubation initiative <a title="http://www.garageplus.asia/en" href="http://www.garageplus.asia/en">Garage+ Startup Global Program.</a></p>
<p>Business Next chose this firm from the triple-digit total that attended Computex on the recommendation of Taipei-based incubator Garage+.</p>
<p>The following Q&amp;A explains what Invision AI plans to do:</p>
<h2>Q: What is Invision AI? What are your goals?</h2>
<p>A: Invision AI is an AI startup founded in the beginning of last year. Our core technologies in artificial intelligence, machine learning, people recognition, face recognition, object tracking and data analysis have been developed for about six years. One of the main applications we’re looking at right now is video analytics.</p>
<p>We’re developing a system that can be trained in the cloud by ingesting video where objects and activities of interest have been annotated. In the course of last year, we developed relationships with some major companies building out these solutions.</p>
<h2>Q: Why are you here at Computex? What are some of the opportunities that you’re looking for?</h2>
<p>A: The reason we’ve been very interested in coming to Taiwan is that many of the people making the sensors, including the camera sensors, the video sensors, are Taiwanese companies. So, I think our next office outside of Canada is probably going to be in Taiwan. Our whole focus is making millions and millions of devices smart.</p>
<p>We don’t want to just make a few devices smart for a very high price. We realized that if we want to make these millions of devices, we would have to work with Taiwanese companies so that we can design it and manufacture it.</p>
<p>Through the Garage+ Startup Global program, we’ve been introduced to Quanta Computer, (power supply maker) Delta Electronics and many other key players in Taiwan’s ICT industry. The chances are we’re going to be working closely with all of the companies we met as OEM/ODM contractors.</p>
<p>I think if it goes well with the companies that we’re talking with, we’d like to have people in Taipei so that we have support on the ground floor.</p>
<h2>Q: How much money have you raised so far?</h2>
<p>A: We raised a small amount of money when we first set the company up. The funds came from big companies in India, which our business contacts introduced to us. We’re waiting now until the end of this trip. We’ve got a number of different projects and now we’re going to look at a much larger funding this year.</p>
<h2>Q: Many software companies are working on AI as well, and they compete to hire top engineering talent. Do you think you have an advantage in recruiting?</h2>
<p>A: I’d say we’ve been very lucky with talents. Right now, we have 10 people on the team. We have two groups of people. We have a core group of people who are Ph.D., post-doctorate fellows, artificial intelligence experts who are designing the core algorithms. And then we have another group of people who are embedded programmers, writing C++ embedded real-time applications.</p>
<p>Our access to talents has been very good. I think cities in Canada are becoming a magnet for top international product and engineering talent. Also, (in Canada) we have University of Montréal, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and those three universities have very strong computer science departments.</p>
<h2>Q: What’s next for Invision AI?</h2>
<p>A: Our products are still underdevelopment, so we’ll continue our work in product development. For our technologies in people recognition and face recognition, we want to make those available at a very low cost to the camera manufacturers.</p>
<p>The idea is that they will be able to put it on every device they ship. We’re seeing a lot of potential in Asia. We think there’s a lot of opportunities in mainland China, in terms of video surveillance, securities, and smart cities. And we’re excited that Taiwan is going to be an important business partner to take our business to the next level.</p>

<p>Delivery service within three hours is currently available in Giftpack’s U.S. home town as well as five major cities in Taiwan, including the capital and New Taipei. That delivery speed is unusually fast, a boon to standing out among competitors.</p>
<p>The company says in a report that it aims to grow in Taiwan and reach into Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. It expects to expand in the United States, as well.</p>
<p>Giftpack started service in May in Sydney and the city of Taoyuan in northern Taiwan. It’s also available in the Taiwan cities of Kaohsiung, Taichung and Tainan. Other parts of Taiwan will be covered over the next few months.</p>
<p>The company lets online shoppers receive products from local merchants within three hours of a purchase. Shoppers can use an iOS app in Chinese, English and Japanese to find items for gifting. They pay by credit card.</p>
<p>The app download page says shoppers may also add personalized text, video or voice messages, voice or video messages to their gifts.</p>
<p>The service’s seven-person staff works with 120 on-demand contract packers to make deliveries go smoothly.</p>
<h2>The back story</h2>
<p>According to the company website, the founders began planning two years ago. They first delivered Starbucks coffee to friends and family in San Francisco and Taipei.</p>
<p>Giftpack’s co-founder is Archer Chiang. The 26-year-old Taiwanese man, now the Giftpack CEO, graduated from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Chiang previously received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The cross-border gifting idea was first tested in China with a small-scale coffee delivery service for Chinese hostels, Chiang said. Chiang believed that test to be successful and decided to try it in San Francisco as he was based there.</p>
<p>“Finding your startup’s product market fit is the most important step,” said Chiang <a title="https://www.appcoda.com.tw/giftpack-interview/" href="https://www.appcoda.com.tw/giftpack-interview/">in a report.</a></p>
<p>Giftpack found it sometimes got overwhelmed by orders in San Francisco and had to outsource some deliveries to a rival in the United States.</p>
<p>But the startup is vying in a crowded field of e-commerce and delivery services. It faces competition from major names such as GrubHub, Uber Eats, Postmates and DoorDash in the United States. E-retailers such as PChome Online and Shopee will vie with it in Taiwan.</p>
<p>PCHome says it can deliver within six hours in Taipei. Another player, Momo, now guarantees 12-hour deliveries in cities in northern Taiwan. But Giftpack’s number of gifts lags those of its peers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Giftpack opened a pop-up store inside the Taipei shopping center Q Square to complement its online presence. Shoppers can see and touch products such as candles, photo frames and dried flower bouquets.</p>

However, not everyone who drinks wine knows how to catalogue all the bottles they might mass in their cellars.</p>
<p>Now a Taipei-based startup is mixing wine and mobile software with app called <a title="http://cell.wine" href="http://cell.wine/">CellWine</a> to help collectors sort out their stash with the possibility of making friends in the process.</p>
<p>The app that helps people keep track of their reds, whites and roses has been downloaded more than 40,000 times since its launch in June 2017. France is the top download destination followed by Italy. CellWine app ranks among France’s top 100 apps.</p>
<p>CellWine has received a patent for its work in Taiwan and United States as well.</p>
<p>Mario Fang and Eric Tang founded CellWine. The two Taiwanese entrepreneurs talked to Business Next about how they started it.</p>
<h2>A work interlude followed by comics and a thing for wine</h2>
<p>Fang first founded a public relations firm at age 28 and later sold it to a French company. He pondered his next move until last year.</p>
<p>“I wanted to do something different, and the other reason I want to keep working is that as a father, I want to set a good example for my kid that you have to do something creative for fulfilling your life,” he said.</p>
<p>He eventually read the Japanese comic book series Drops of God, which mentions red wine. Fang from there onward become a loyal fan of the drink and began to collect bottles of it from other countries.</p>
<p>“There is a common problem for wine lovers,” he said. “The more (bottles of wine) you buy, the more you would easily forget where they are.”</p>
<p>Wine collectors usually sort bottles in some order to remember what’s in them or rent a cellar away from home, Fang said.</p>
<p>“But, could we invent a solution to make it easier?” he recalls thinking. So he shared his ideas with Tang, a software engineer who has made more than 20 apps.</p>
<p>“At the very first, Mario just wanted to design this app for himself to manage those bottles of wine,” Tang said. “But I sensed there is a big chance that we could do it for reaching global market.” It was that discussion that birthed the idea of CellWine together as business.</p>
<h2>International following</h2>
<p>CellWine is intended to help wine drinkers manage the detail of every bottle they buy. It records the date of purchase and location of storage, for example. Some wines become more valuable as they age. These data points help collectors to know how valuable each bottle is.</p>
<p>The app’s label identification system requires that users aim their phone camera at a bottle without taking a photo. This function lets users take down information such as the wine’s origin, price and grape variety. Users can also see through the app who else has bought the same type of wine, offering them potential social connections.</p>
<p>“We have gotten much feedback from French users, and actually we are very surprised this app has been widely used in France since we did only little advertising on Google keywords on this giant search engine,” Fang said.</p>
<p>The wine research and information website <a title="https://wineblots.com/about-us" href="https://wineblots.com/about-us">WineBlot</a>, has praised CellWine as one of its <a title="https://wineblots.com/wine-lifestyle/top-5-wine-apps-for-wine-lovers" href="https://wineblots.com/wine-lifestyle/top-5-wine-apps-for-wine-lovers">“Top 5 Wine App for Wine Lovers”.</a> The website calls it “simple to use.”</p>
<p>The founders now plan to expand into the U.S. and Japanese markets this year and work toward an initial public offering.</p>
<p>“Now we have registered an office in United State since the USA actually is the top one wine consumption country, and we are planning to cooperate with local partners to launch a whole new thing for our users,” Tang said. One idea is to add e-commerce to the app, he said.</p>
<p>The founders did not give financial data for their app, which has competitors offshore.</p>
<h2>Trust in the face of discouragement</h2>
<p>CellWine worked as a business largely because the two founders trusted each other through mutual friends, Tang said. They have worked on the app for two years.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of problems we encountered when we started to run a startup,” he said. “But Mario and I trust each other. Once there is a problem that shows up, we just sit down and talk since our goal is the same – to make CellWine better and better.”</p>
<p>Among the barriers to starting up was discouraging feedback.</p>
<p>“I am a person who loves to share things with people I’ve met,” Fang said. “I remembered that sometimes I had told people about my idea of making the CellWine app and its function. Some people would encourage me, but indeed there were a few people said there is no need to use for this app since they prefer to take notes to remind themselves (about wine) or some people might ask their own secretaries to remember where the expensive bottles of wine are.</p>
<p>“I do feel frustrated when I’ve hear this negative feedbacks, but I would tell myself that I trust what I am doing now with my partner Eric,” he said.</p>
<p>The duo is now exploring chances to go overseas for exhibitions to learn more about markets and startup ecosystems outside Taiwan.</p>
<p>“Startups always need sources to support, and the culture of the startup ecosystem in Taiwan is still in its development,” Tang said. “Therefore, we spent our own budget to join different exhibitions…and did gain some chances to meet potential partners and investors. I think this is a good investment for us, too.”</p>
<p>To promote CellWine overseas, the founders attended <a title="https://riseconf.com" href="https://riseconf.com/">RISE Hong Kong 2017</a> and <a title="https://websummit.com" href="https://websummit.com/">WebSummit 2017.</a>This year it will join <a title="https://collisionconf.com" href="https://collisionconf.com/">Collision</a> in the United States in the final week of April with Taiwan Startup Stadium, a government-supported organization to help Taiwanese startups expand overseas.</p>

<p><a title="https://en.pinkoi.com" href="https://en.pinkoi.com/">Pinkoi</a>’s volume of cross-border orders have grown 200% over the past two years, making up over 30 percent of total transactions and up from not quite 10% at the outset.</p>
<p>The company says its gains in business abroad stem from changes in products and approaches to each market.</p>
<p>To get a grip overseas, Pinkoi acquired Japanese designer ecommerce platform <a title="https://www.iichi.com" href="https://www.iichi.com/">iichi</a> in 2016, giving it access to the Japanese side’s design talent pool.</p>
<p>A year earlier Pinkoi had opened shop in Thailand to expand there. It gradually developed a cohort of local designers and now arranges sales of more than 500 Thai brands.</p>
<p>Cofounder and Chief Executive Peter Yen said in an interview that growth accelerated solidly after about 100 Thai brands had signed on. That momentum enabled Pinkoi to start increasing cross-border operations in 2016, leading to steep growth last year.</p>
<p>The company has also entered Malaysia and now has its sights on China.</p>
<p>Pinkoi has no plans to open a China office, but Yen said the firm will hold a Pinkoi Market fair, an event which showcases the platform’s products, in May in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Pinkoi has worked with DHL, FedEx and local delivery companies over the past two years to raise the transparency of logistics operations, Yen said.</p>
<p>Customers care less about delivery speed than knowing which phase of delivery an item is in, so Pinkoi tries to offer them a sense of security.</p>
<h2>Buyer-seller interface</h2>
<p>Pinkoi and its sellers have cut the time needed from receiving an order to shipping it by 30%. Customers are happier and sellers more efficient, Yen said.</p>
<p>Mobile transactions already take up 77% of Pinkoi’s total in China and Japan, and over 60% in both Taiwan and Thailand. Pinkoi has accordingly adjusted the backend management of vendors as well as consumer interface procedures to suit mobile phone users.</p>
<p>The ecommerce platform will also bolster direct contact between buyers and sellers, extending an evaluation system that’s in place already. Pinkoi’s reach of 88 countries raises the need for communication channels that build understanding between sellers and consumers from different countries to make purchase decisions easier, Yen said.</p>
<p>Increasing cross-border transactions is paramount, the chief officer said. Those are the toughest to build, he said, so getting them right will raise Pinkoi’s competitive edge. The goal: making 60% of all business cross-border.</p>

<p>As robotics in medicine becomes more widely used, Brain Navi Biotechonlogy Co. says on its website that its Brain Navi navigation system can “provide precise information and real-time images to reduce the risk of surgical complications.”</p>
<p>“It is [like] an autopilot system for neurosurgeries,” Brain Navi founder and CEO Jerry Chih-Hsiao Chen said in an interview with Business Next.</p>
<p>The company calls its system “the third eye and hand of the doctor.”</p>
<p>The system’s robotic arm and camera system will be able to work at a positioning accuracy of less than one millimeter, more than what a human surgeon can do, Chen said.</p>
<p>Founded in August 2015 and headquartered in Hsinchu of northern Taiwan, Brain Navi Biotechonlogy set out to merge emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision into robotic-assisted guidance system for neurosurgeons.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Brain Navi’s R&amp;D staff has been working on camera-based computer vision algorithms to estimate 3D geometry and motion during brain surgeries. The system is built to help surgeons come up with a surgery plan based on pre-operative imagery, including MRI scans of internal body structures.</p>
<p>A deep-brain surgical procedure for implanting electrodes that stimulate areas in the brain normally takes over eight hours to complete the procedure. The Brain Navi system cuts that time to less than eight minutes and reduces the time patients spend under anesthesia, Chen said.</p>
<p>“Brain Navi Surgical Navigation System provides clear and precise guidance for doctors and minimizes the loss of normal brain tissues,” Chen said in a YouTube video posted in August 2017.</p>
<p>Chen said in a report that the Brain Navi system can particularly help surgeons do robotic surgery for Parkinson’s disease. The Brain Navi surgical robot can be used to help place electrodes in the brain to provide deep brain stimulation.</p>
<p>The company faces competition from international players such as Intuitive Surgical, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medtronic. Brain Navi expects its system to help meet a growing demand and be among the best technologically.</p>
<p>The system is not in use yet. It is undergoing tests for approval in Taiwan, the United States, and Europe. The firm will eventually seek regulatory approval, including from the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Brain Navi announced in a Facebook post that TechCrunch Disrupt had picked its surgical navigation system and robotic arms to be shown on September 5-7 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Chen is also director of urology at China Medical University’s Beigang Hospital in Beigang in Taiwan and a biomedical engineering researcher. He got a master’s degree in biomedical engineering and was a PhD candidate of National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.</p>
<p>His scientific background gives Chen unique insight into surgical robotics. His research includes biomedical signal processing, nanotechnologies and medical device development.</p>
<p>The Stanford-Taiwan Biomedical Fellowship Program, a training program operated by the Taiwan government’s National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL), accepted Chen in 2012. He went to Stanford University to learn more about the startup ecosystem in the nearby Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Stanford program, in 2012 Chen and other fellows founded iXensor, a medical device maker. Chen was its chief medical officer.</p>

Furthermore, the sound legal environment provides excellent protection for entrepreneurs about intellectual property and foreign investment, and strong IT cluster with numerous global leading brands draws a lot of foreigners trying to build their own company in Taiwan.</p>
<p>There are two entrepreneurs from French who wanted to set up a marketing company got a lot of help in the beginning with Taiwan’s entrepreneur visa and eventually successfully began their career in Taiwan with the company Pineapple Website Design.</p>
<p>Julien Ferard and Maxime Lefevre, two young men from France set up their own company Pineapple Web Design two years ago. Julien Ferard has studied in National Taiwan University for one year as an exchange student about 6 years ago, and afterwards, he would like to stay and tried to find a job in Taiwan. After working in a company for 4 years, Ferard decided to open a new company. As for Maxime Lefevre, he took a trip to Taiwan for a month as a backpacker, and also loved the culture here, wanting live here after that. Lefevre got hired in the same company that Ferard did in Taiwan, so that was how they met and then decided to set up a company together.</p>
<p>You might wonder why pineapple, why did they choose pineapple as the brand logo? “It’s because in Taiwanese and in Cantonese it means prosperity coming or prosperity arrives,” Ferard explained.  Ferard and Lefevre think the graphics of the pineapple is quite sophisticated, so it’s really easy to make some designs and advertisements with the pineapple, and it’s also easy for clients to remember.</p>
<p>Both of them agree that’s tough for foreigners to set up a business in Taiwan, and the biggest difficulties might be getting the information since most of the information for opening a company is in Chinese, and the English access is really hard to retrieve. “But of course the entrepreneur visa for us is a big opportunity to set up a business in Taiwan, because we don’t need that much capital to start the company, we actually need much lower capital than if we didn’t have it.  And there’s still the turnover that we are required to have, it’s much lower than if we had a normal company.”Ferard noted that with the visa, it became easier for a startup to deal with the capital required in the beginning.</p>
<p>Besides finance, with entrepreneur visa, setting up for foreign entrepreneurs in Taiwan becomes much easier. First, there is no need for entrepreneurs to set up a business before applying the visa.What’s more convenient is that with the visa, foreign entrepreneurs get residency for 1 year with unlimited entry, and able to extend visa without leaving Taiwan.</p>
<p>Now, there are about 6 Taiwanese companies delegating Pineapple Web Design to design the English website. Most of them are hotels or restaurants which requires English access to reservations or promotion for tourists from different countries. They are also surprised that some big companies didn’t really manage well the website or there is even nobody in charge of the website work. However, he also mentioned that some hotels are happy to see some people like them come in with some solutions for them, so that they can get out of this cycle with Booking.com and those other platforms. “So I think we got a great welcome with that, with the hotel industry. We are creating solutions for them, and I think that was a great experience.”</p>
<p>Besides those international hotels and restaurants, Pineapple Web. Design is trying to provide cheap website service to make it accessible for small business. Since Facebook is talking about closing business pages, and all those restaurants, all those bars and clubs, their biggest communication channel is Facebook, they will need something else. Furthermore, they are still working on the website that will be called Taiwan Tourism for offering civil service for foreigners that come to Taiwan to do some rafting, some hiking, some restaurants, some Taipei 101 visits, etc.</p>
<p>Julien Ferard and Maxime Lefevre appreciated the convenience staying in Taiwan with the Entrepreneur Visa, and also appreciated the assistance from FutureWard to help them break the obstacle of Taiwanese culture. Furthermore, they find more possibilities of development in the process of communicating with Taiwan’s startups.</p>

The fact that foreigners want to build their own career in Taiwan is no longer an impossible mission, becauseTaiwan’s Entrepreneurs Visa has been released since 2015.  The simple process and few requests of Taiwan’s Entrepreneurs Visa draw more and more foreigners to chase their dream. Kevin Wolkober, with the special visa, built a brand-new app in 2016 to introduce Taiwan to the whole world.</p>
<p>Sitting at the center of the Asia Pacific region, it is easy for entrepreneurs in Taiwan to travel both domestically and internationally with airports and amazing public transpotation systems.  Besides, Taiwan has a large and highly educated workforce pool which is especially abundant with R&amp;D talent. Combining above factors and many other wonderful conditions, Taiwan is definitely a great place to set up an intruding app “like Eat Drink Taiwan”.</p>
<p>Kevin Wolkober first became interested in Taiwan through some Taiwanese friends he made while working in New York in 2008.  With all the good things they had to say about their homeland, and the fact of never having been abroad before, he became more and more interested in experiencing it for himself.  By 2011, his curiosity could be held back no longer &#8211; he visited Taiwan, and quickly came to love the environment and culture.  After three years of travelling back and forth between the two, he realized that the image of Taiwan through other Westerner’s eyes was not the same Taiwan he was seeing for himself, and decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>“Because my background is in writing software, I wanted to use my own abilities to help introduce Taiwan to outsiders.”  He easily identified a universal want for potential users: good food.  And thus, Eat Drink Taiwan was born.  Wolkober intends for this app to act as a substitute for a local guide, introducing the foreigner to real Taiwanese cuisine.  “If you can’t speak Chinese, you can use these kind of simple tools to help you order food yourself&#8230;it doesn’t matter if you are local or foreign, we all need these tools to create that cultural bridge and get to know one another.”</p>
<p>Like many other foreign business owners today, Wolkober is in Taiwan under the Entrepreneur Visa. He figured it out with the help of FutureWard, a coworking space here in Taipei, and says the biggest advantage of the Entrepreneur Visa is the residency card, which allows him to stay in Taiwan longer and develop new products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa, innovative entrepreneurs even don&#8217;t have to build an enterprise first, and get a residency for 1 year with unlimited entry.   Moreover, the visa can be extended up to 2 years without leaving Taiwan, and if residing in Taiwan for 5 years, entrepreneurs are able to apply for permanent residence.  With the visa, Wolkober no longer needs to travel back and forth between Taiwan and the U.S. Instead, getting residency for long makes him more concentrate on the development of app and also on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Eat Drink Taiwan has been available on the App Store for more than two years now, with popularity on the rise.  Wolkober intends to continue adding more information to it, hopes to keep gaining viewers, and is open to collaborating with other travel companies in the future.</p>

A speaker a Meet’s latest event explained how tech firms can take GPS farther.</p>
<p>Ian Chen, CEO of Taipei city-based Starwing spoke at the March 13 event Meet IoT Salon, about a system he calls indoor positioning.</p>
<p>The 4-year-old Taipei-based firm has mastered the angle-of-arrival method for determining the direction of a radio-frequency waves on an <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_array" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_array">antenna array</a>, or determined from maximum signal strength during antenna rotation. That method is more accurate than other GPS technology, Chen said.</p>
<p>Angle-of-arrival has traditionally been used to discover the location of pirate radio stations or of military radio transmitters.</p>
<p>Indoor positioning works especially in department stores. <a title="https://www.starwing.com.tw" href="https://www.starwing.com.tw/">Starwing</a> counts the Taiwanese mall chain Breeze Center, Taipei Expo Park, the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and other big outfits among its customers.</p>
<p>A department store or shopping mall can use the technology to see remotely what spots are most popular at any single time. Large garages and factories can use it to know where things are happening and make follow-up decisions based on activity levels.</p>
<p>Garages and factories can accurately locate movements for discoveries that in turn improve management and reduce accidents.</p>
<p>Starwing has further developed a 3D graphics system for indoor positioning. It finds this system more precise than the more common 2D planar location technology.</p>
<p>Chen was one of six speakers at the 14th Meet IoT Salon, which took place at CDIB Capital Innovation Accelerator in Taipei. The keynote speaker was Tino Hildebrand, vice president of Siemens Ltd. Taiwan. It belongs to the 171-year-old German firm <a title="https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html" href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home.html">Siemens</a>, units of which are pursuing IoT-related technology.</p>
<p>The organizer Meet is part of the Business Next media group. Meet holds offline and online events to connect startups, venture capital firms and entrepreneurs with the goal of improving Taiwan’s startup ecosystem. Meet’s IoT Salon is one in that series of events.</p>
<p>As the internet of things (IoT) is widely seen as a growing subsector of high technology, Meet IoT Salon sets out to give participants a deeper understanding of IoT itself and the realm of places where it can be used.</p>

Now an entrepreneur in Taiwan hopes to change that routine by sending packages of high-end leaves abroad via e-commerce.</p>
<p>Laura Lu founded <a title="http://www.levertthe.com/en/home.aspx" href="http://www.levertthe.com/en/home.aspx">Le Vert Thé</a> five years ago to interest the global market in local teas. She’s a tea fanatic herself and naturally likes her homeland.</p>
<p>Le Vert Thé means “green tea” in French, which Lu was studying when she opened the shop.</p>
<h2>Selling tea culture</h2>
<p>Taiwan draws its most valued and flavorful tea, an oolong, tea from a spot called Da Yu Ling in the high mountains of central Taiwan. But few people know Taiwan has this locale or that it’s known for tea. Lu also habitually drinks tea, so she wants to make more people to know about its flavor as well as its origins.</p>
<p>Tea was introduced to Taiwan from nearby Fujian province in China in the 1700s. Taiwan was growing about <a title="https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?post=4361&amp;unit=4,29,31,45" href="https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?post=4361&amp;unit=4,29,31,45">20,000 metric tons of tea per year</a> as of 2009 but seeing a fall in exports.</p>
<p>Taiwan lacks the land of larger tea-growing countries, but older Taiwanese often brew their own from locally grown leaves in clay pots with other specialized implements. Some specialty shops, as well as Starbucks, also make a point of serving Taiwanese tea.</p>
<p>Lu hopes to merge tea and Taiwanese brewing culture through her sales.</p>
<p>“The essence of drinking a good cup of tea is from its quality, and how you brew it also matters a lot,” she told Business Next Media.</p>
<h2>Entrepreneur’s story</h2>
<p>Lu, as a interior designer herself, uses her old talent to design Le Vert Thé ’s tealeaf boxes with a look that she describes as simple beauty.</p>
<p>She uses eco-friendly packaging for every item and avoids packaging waste.</p>
<p>As for what’s inside each box, Lu uses her connections with local tea growers to pick every type of tea herself with an eye toward quality.</p>
<p>Le Vert The began selling tea to friends and family when the brand was first founded and eventually moved into e-commerce. Customers order it now straight from the vendor’s official website. They come from places as far flung as Australia and Denmark, Lu said.</p>
<p>“After buying our tea first time, now, (customers from Australia and Denmark) become the regular customers to purchase the tea, which shows our quality of tea is consistent,” Lu said.</p>
<p>As her reputation spread, the Eslite mall chain in Taiwan asked Le Vert Thé to open a store inside a branch in Taipei. Although no longer with Eslite, she now selling tea leaves in a restaurant in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Taipei.</p>

<h2>Telling stories to compete</h2>
<p>Unique stories such as the Opus narratives coupled with a co-founder’s depth of software knowledge have earned SIGONO awards and allowed it to vie with bigger-name game developers.</p>
<p>The Opus series was designed to feature a strong narrative story with attention to details such as artwork and music to compete against larger, better funded companies in the mobile game industry, SIGONO co-founder Brian Lee said.</p>
<p>Rocket of Whispers won Indie Game Award “Best Narration” at the <a title="http://tgs.tca.org.tw/index_protal.php" href="http://tgs.tca.org.tw/index_protal.php">2018 Taipei International Game Show</a> , following similar honors last year.</p>
<p>Lee describes “Opus: Rocket of Whispers” as more “like a movie” with an emphasis on creativity and narrative structure with flexibility for multiple platforms. On Switch, Nintendo’s game console, the game earned a TOP10 ranking.</p>
<h2>Quest to be different</h2>
<p>Lee and co-founder Scott Chen developed an appetite for something different and niche-oriented while studying at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States. The teamed up and unexpectedly scored an early hit with a game for Xbox Connect. It was quickly picked up by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Though the company began with just two people in 2013, Lee was an early adopter of project management tools and keen to oversee efficient operations.</p>
<p>“Although everyone says that the game industry is a creative industry, it’s essentially a software industry,” Lee said. “For software project development, I think it would be terrible if there wasn’t strict control.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the company grew to about a dozen people, Lee has kept a watchful eye fretting “if one person delays progress, there will be a domino effect putting the software development at risk.”</p>
<p>SIGONO vies with bigger competitors who are willing to spend increasingly large sums to market games. In just 2012, the average marketing budget for mobile games was around US$150,000 and it’s now US$300,000 to US$600,000 .</p>
<p>Opus downloads continue to soar despite the company having a modest marketing budget.</p>
<p>The developer gets another boost from analytics and tools such as Google Firebase and BigQuery. Those integrate information to allow for localization based upon the needs of different users worldwide. From 80% to 90% of downloads originate overseas.</p>

Hailed by many as a quasi-revolutionary revision of Taiwan’s labor law, the act is expected to open the door for foreign talent beginning next year. In the long run, it is hoped that it will infuse Taiwan’s economy with creativity and the means to remain competitive on the global market.</p>
<p>One of the act’s main advocates is “serial entrepreneur” Ping Chu. Here the Harvard-educated entrepreneur shares his thoughts on the importance of internationalizing Taiwan’s workforce, as well as some of the challenges this entails.</p>
<p>Following plenty of successful enterprises, Chu founded the Canmeng Institute in 2008 and the “Ripplemaker Foundation” in 2010, both of which aim to support young entrepreneurs. Additionally, he is the author of Businessmaker, Daymaker, Ripplemaker, where he outlines the core philosophy underpinning the great variety of businesses he was and still is involved in.</p>
<p>Partially due to his academic upbringing overseas, partially thanks to his easy-going and adventurous personality, Chu over the course of time has built lasting friendships with people from all over the world.</p>
<p>At his Red Room, a venue for artists to display their works or read poetry, individuals from different cultures mingle. For Chu, the Red Room is a way of connecting international artists to Taiwan.</p>
<p>“I don’t pay for them to produce art. Rather, I simply provide them with a space where they can work together and inspire each other. In the end, many artists and friends really want to stay in Taiwan.”</p>
<p>This is even more surprising since average salaries in Taiwan are still exceptionally low for the most part, while visa requirements at the same time put unnecessary obstacles in the way of foreigners wishing to work. Yet Chu says that Taiwan and its liberal culture help balance out the disadvantages of the conservative labor market.</p>
<p>Many of his foreign friends adore the lifestyle and friendships with locals, and he expects that many more will decide to stay once the recently passed act bears fruit.</p>
<p>Chu is aware that the act is not only met with support, but has also engendered a fair share of criticism. To be sure, many approve of it and argue that having more foreign professional will assist Taiwan’s economy to become more competitive.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, others worry that it will undermine job opportunities for locals.</p>
<p>“Hiring a foreign professional needs a certain budget, which usually can only be afforded and rendered feasible by certain industries such as finance, pharmaceutics, or the tech sector,” Chu believes that the act would not result in rising unemployment among locals as foreigners would not compete for the jobs that local can do. Rather, a more competitive economy will create more local job opportunities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Chu hopes that the act will succeed in attracting well-educated foreign talent and benefit the island nation economically and culturally.</p>
<p>With the legal framework finally being revised, a more welcoming working and living environment for foreigners should emerge over the next decade. Combined with Taiwan’s many other advantages, the introduction of an internationalized job market could do wonders for the nation’s development.</p>

<h5><strong>Our Mission: The Endeavor for Harmonious Oncology </strong><strong>through Perpetual Innovation.</strong></h5>
<p>Johnpro Biotech Inc. was established in Taiwan in 2014, to focus on research and develop of oncology medicine. Much of the biopharma establishment has neglected to fully understand the mechanisms at work in the disease of cancer. Aiming to bridge these gaps, Johnpro uses a multi-modality approach to treating cancer. Founded by an oncology doctor with 30+ years of clinical experience with a group of dedicated researchers, our team has used an understanding of the disease and the patient, to develop breakthroughs in drugs and cell therapy. We have a core belief that better patient care and cures can be unlocked through boundless learning and persistent innovation.</p>
<p>By means of vigilant clinical observation, keenness to patient needs, and the discernment of feedback, Johnpro is developing methods that can be applied to future oncology therapy, without ignoring the needs of patients facing cancer today. Research into biochemistry and immunology has been the basis of the major developmental directions of the company: drug repurposing through the 505(b)(2) initiative, and cell therapy. For our efforts, we have been granted national awards and international patents for pioneering technology.</p>
<p>As we strive for the Cure, we have built a R&amp;D team with roots in clinical practice.</p>
<p>These collective experiences have allowed us to develop proprietary in-house  technologies and methods while adhering to time and budget controls. Developed  via applied medicine, each innovation is the result of consideration for the patient, patient-family, and practitioner. Physical tolerance, lifestyle maintenance, clinical application, and financial feasibility are taken into account through every step of development. Our philosophy is that the equation for oncology development, in the end, must equate to patient benefit.</p>
<h5><strong>Science in Mind, Humanity at Heart.</strong></h5>
<p>Johnpro utilizes repurposed drugs to control the tumor microenvironment and cell-metabolism in developing new drug applications. Experiences in clinical patientcare has allowed us to reverse-engineer the approach and processes to cancer therapy. With a global perspective on drug development, our platforms enable us to collaborate our research with the international biopharmaceutical establishment, realizing returns on a global scale.</p>
<p>Led by our founder, our R&amp;D team has the capability of endogenous innovation, resulting in proprietary patents. Comprehensive experience in applied clinical oncology has allowed us to have a multi-modality outlook on oncology therapy. By engaging in cross-field experimentations in molecular biology, cellular biology, and in vivo application, the synergies of our technologies have created breakthrough advances on an expedited pathway to drug approval.</p>
<p>Our endeavors always revolve around the goal of patient well-being. From our experiences with successful and failed patient therapies, we continue to innovate the best treatment for the individual patient. For clinical practitioners, realizable drug approval according to allotted timeframe is the most practical reality. The course of traditional drug development often takes a decade or more, leaving behind the patients facing cancer today. Johnpro’s approach is to take a bottomsup approach, using patient-monitoring from clinical experiences to gain efficiencies that enable accelerated development.</p>
<p>For patients and oncology researchers, the innovation of effective and cost-appropriate therapies that can be realized by all patients, without exacerbating burdens of patients’ families and healthcare systems is the way forward. This is the raison d&#8217;être for Johnpro, and the aims of our collective endeavor.</p>
<h5><strong>Company Vision : Science, Humanity, Pragmatism</strong></h5>
<p>Our company’s core motto is “Science in Mind, Humanity at Heart.”<br />
-Through science, will we find the path to the Cure.<br />
-Through pragmatism, can we care for the patient.<br />
The financial means to reach these goals must be built on efficient synergies, not extravagant squanders. By remaining steadfast to our core philosophies, we believe we are on the path to achieving optimal patient-care.</p>

Moreover, in 2015, Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa was back, which facilitates the process of founding a corporation in Taiwan. With the special visa, applicants would get residency for 1 year before setting up a business including the spouse and children under 20. After the expiration, the application can be extend up to 2 years each time, and after being resident for 5 years in Taiwan, applicants are qualified to apply for permanent residency.</p>
<p>Ruchmair, who came to Taiwan from Jamaica to set up his own business in November, said that he had received a call from one of his investors in Jamaica who suggest him to come to Taiwan, not only for the great opportunities here but also for the new program of startups; therefore he did. Ruchmair is only 25-year-old, and used to work on creating software tools which make game development easier in his former company in Jamaica. However, the gaming industry is not popular in Jamaica, so with the ambition and the exclusive visa, Ruchmair came to Taiwan and began to set up the game development company which is just his second company. “This is my first trip in Asia, and I never work for another company here before,” he said. It’s really hard to imagine there are a lot of people willing to start their own business in Taiwan, and even from some countries like Jamaica which is far away from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Ruchmair’s company in Taiwan is also about the game project with focus on the software on mobile devices and named after his own name, Ruchmair. (洛西米爾) He has been working on a game for about 8 months, because it hasn’t released so he laughed and said that he couldn’t talk too much about the game. “We are still working on it,” he said, “we’re trying to bring the games usually fund on the PC or TV to the mobile devices, which is what people expect to find. Although there is only one person in Jamaica that Ruchmair works with, “we’re looking for the other persons to join. It’s just the beginning,” he said with confidence.</p>

<p>When mentioning that he chose Taiwan to start a business, Ruchmair said that he really likes the culture of the East, and working in Taiwan helps him to push his products to China, to Japan, and even to the whole market in Asia. “The Taiwan’s Entrepreneur Visa makes doing business much easier,” he said. “It only took about 5 minutes to get the visa done. You just have to hand in the passport, take some photos and then you get the visa which pretty impressed me,” he said. Furthermore, Ruchmair mentioned that building startups in Japan for a foreigner is much harder than in Taiwan, so he chose Taiwan as a base and hoped to extent his business to Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking to recommending a friend what to do to start a business in Taiwan, Ruchmair said the very first thing is to check the visa which makes the process easier, because “with the visa there is a company; without the visa there is no company.” Ruchmair also think the industries of software and hardware in Taiwan are really strong and both of the occupations and markets are universal, so for those who wants to enter the Asia market, Taiwan is a perfect step one. He talked about that the game studio is really growing in Taiwan, where there are many impressive studios. “There is also the gaming industry in Jamaica, but it’s not as big as one in Taiwan,” he said.</p>
<p>About the expectation of the entrepreneurial environment in Taiwan in the future, being in Taipei for only 2 months, Ruchmair said that he is still learning the attitudes and behaviors that people have a business here as well as figuring out what businesses are like here to run a company efficiently with the help from the entrepreneurial program of iiiNNO. “I recently meet Taipei, and a lot of things are really impressive and quite different from ones in Jamaica. Actually, I like it,” he ended up saying.</p>

They applied for the entrepreneur using the VC investment as the criteria. With good lawyers helping out they found everything to be very smooth.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budden has recently extended his Entrepreneur Visa for the first time. To get the extension they had to show they had hired several people.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budden says he sees himself continue to live in Taiwan even as Vectr is taking off. In a few years he figures Vectr will have 30-40 employees in Taiwan of which 70% would be locals and the rest foreigners. They think this mix would be perfect to both take advantage of Taiwan’s local talent and also be international. They will also likely have several other offices around the world of about the same size.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has participated in events organized by the Taiwan Startup Stadium. Vectr was one of 8 Taiwanese start-ups that represented Taiwan at Slush Asia in Tokyo in May 2016 where they were one of the five finalists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He often recommends other foreigners to apply for the Entrepreneur Visa. He says there are many great programmers from all over the world who come to Taiwan to teach languages after they graduate.

They mainly help foreigners with their investments in Taiwanese companies, work permits/ family visas for foreign employees, and bookkeeping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 15 years, Guo and his team has&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped over 300 entrepreneurs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to register companies and do their bookkeeping. They have also helped many companies to apply for work permits and visas.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an expert in helping foreign entrepreneurs getting set up in Taiwan, Guo was of course very excited when the entrepreneur visa was announced. So far JusRegal has helped one French team with three founders to get their entrepreneur visas. “We were referred by another accounting firm that my clients first approached; they did not have the expertise in immigration law so they referred us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the entrepreneur visa was first announced, Guo found he had some questions that even some government front-line government officers couldn’t answer. Now when he has been through the process, his advice for aspiring entrepreneurs is for them to seek help from professionals like a &nbsp;CPA or lawyer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOEA has issued a FAQ sheet, but every entrepreneur’s situation is unique so it is good to get some help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guo points out that one of the most common misconceptions is that the entrepreneur visa holders are allowed to work in Taiwan. This is both partially right and partially wrong. EV holders are free to explore and do things that are related to their entrepreneur visa, but in order to be paid in Taiwan,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a work permit is required for WHICH EV Holders are not eligible. To get a work permit, they need to apply for a traditional resident permit for the purpose of working in Taiwan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that it’s easier for entrepreneur holders to apply for a work permit for themselves and for their other foreign employees after the business is set up. Find out more&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In overall, Guo thinks the entrepreneur visa is a great start for Taiwan to attract more foreign investments in Taiwan, and he is looking forward to help more teams to apply.</span></p>', '643/f87/da0/643f87da0823c617672869.png', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2023-04-19 06:19:10', null);

Later he found that Taiwan is also a great place for business, therefore deciding to make it the homebase for his startup Spino&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="http://www.spino.tech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.spino.tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 months ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spino is a transparent screen that connects to a smartphone allowing the user to Draw n’ Share™ creations and play classic games. Their team has grown to 3 people, with two French founders and one Taiwanese intern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taiwan is a great place to live”, says Saghiers. He says there are other places where it would be easier for them to build their prototype, Seghier and his partner choose to stay and grow their business in Taiwan. Thanks to Taiwan’s excellent geographical position, Spino is able to work with overseas manufacturers while based in Taipei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Seghier started his business in Taiwan, he learned about the Entrepreneur Visa from a friend. It took him around 2 months to get the visa with the help from local startup community members, such as FutureWard (<a href="http://www.futureward.com">www.futureward.com/</a>), a coworking and meetup spaces especially for hardware makers, and French government/business offices in Taiwan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his excellent Chinese abilities, Seghier found the application process a bit chaotic. He wishes the government would make it easier for entrepreneurs to come in for face to face meetings, to better understand each applicant’s situation and innovation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seghier encourages other hardware entrepreneurs like himself to come and explore Taiwan’s great resources for hardware startups, as well as the cozy lifestyle for all residents.</span></p>', '643/f87/f87/643f87f8785b1803182100.png', 1, '2020-01-03 06:59:22', '2023-04-19 06:19:39', null);

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Fahey, originally from United States, is a lawyer with the firm&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.winklerpartners.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winkler Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ corporate commercial practice group since the firm’s founding in 2002.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighty-five percent of Winkler Partners’ clients are foreign businesses investing in or operating in Taiwan. Clients range in size from startups to some of the world’s largest multinationals. They also represent Taiwanese businesses with investments, operations, or legal problems overseas.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fahey is also known in Taiwan’s international community for his leadership role in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.forwardtaiwan.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forward Taiwan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a public interest group working on reform of Taiwanese immigration law founded by Ping Chu.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Entrepreneur Visa is a fairly new and special form of resident visa in Taiwan. For the experts who helps foreigners apply for visas it has taken a lot of efforts of studying the new law to be able to assist their clients, luckily Winkler Partners now has everything they need.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Fahey helped Vectr on a successful application for two entrepreneur visas and their first renewals. Vectr&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a cloud-based SaaS US company backed by venture capital from the US and Canada. While their market is global, they chose to base their development team in Taiwan.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vectr co-founder Nick Budden has only the best of accolades for the services received, “Fahey is the best lawyer I have ever worked with.”</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fahey has also advised several other founders and teams on their eligibility for the entrepreneur visa.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many benefits exclusively for Entrepreneur Visa holders. Fahey says “One very important benefit are the relaxed requirements for employee work permits enabling companies to hire foreign talent from all over the world with relative ease.”</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if the application is lengthy and document intensive, the various government agencies were very helpful.” says Fahey about the experiences during the application process.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Entrepreneur Visa is issued first for one year and can then be extended twice for one year each. Fahey just helped Budden with the first extension.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Compared to the initial document verification and notarization, the renewal process was rather easy and clear.”&nbsp;</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the different requirements for Entrepreneur Visa, Fahey states that the easiest by far is being accepted into an approved incubator. There are currently 26 such incubators all over Taiwan.</span></p>

								<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Fahey highly praises the Entrepreneur Visa and look forward to helping many more foreign entrepreneurs come and explore Taiwan.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon co-founded Docceo in 2012 with an experienced team of entrepreneurs and designers from all over the world. Gordon was born in Taiwan, raised in the United States, and enjoys a strong business acumen of his own, including consulting with silicon valley company </span><a href="http://www.portrait.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portrait Displays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and as a co-founder of VuTech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founding partners of Docceo had worked together before &#8211; in 2001 they were with Tablet PC startup PaceBlade, but have come back together to “disrupt hospitality”. The Docceo team has devised a smart solution for hospitality called DigiJames comprised of IoT hardware, Software APP and hotel backend management, delivering smart operations, smart building, and smart service.  DigiJames’  smart-room app gives  hotel guests the ability to control all aspects of their experience from an easy to use tablet placed in their room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The applications of Docceo’s technology go beyond streamlining customer service however. The Docceo app is linked to the cloud  that automatically provides the hotel with customer preference data. The hotel can then automatically make assumptions about guest needs or preferences and anticipate what the customer needs. Furthermore, with aggregate data of many customers over months and years, hotels are able to better manage all aspects of their operations. This is the clever application of machine learning from the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Docceo is a very young project, it has already garnered much attention both in Taiwan and abroad. Gordon was a delegate at the APEC summit in the Philippines for 2015. Furthermore, Docceo was named the AAN Forum winner for 2015 and has participated in various international business accelerators like </span><a href="https://orangefab.com/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OrangeFab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Docceo’s most obvious achievement has been landing its first paying customer, the five-star Shangri-La Hotel in Taipei and their partnership with Microsoft</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Docceo has also benefited from doing business here in Taiwan. First, hardware development is top notch &#8211; Gordon notes that having so many established hardware companies so close by makes it easy for Docceo to bring their ideas to life, faster than if they were anywhere else. Furthermore, Docceo has developed relationships with the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs (</span><a href="http://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/home/English.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the Small Medium Enterprise Administration (</span><a href="http://www.moeasmea.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=301&amp;mp=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, who helped them to establish further relationships with the </span><a href="http://www.apecaccelerator.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APEC Accelerator Network (AAN)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This expansive network of public, academic, and private contacts has given Docceo exposure to a wealth of advisers and customers. And while the tangible benefits to headquartering in Taiwan are apparent, the less concrete aspects make it attractive as well. “Taiwanese people are internationally minded and well traveled, and it is a convenient place to work and live,” said Gordon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having embarked on such an encouraging start, the firm has optimistic aspirations. “Our first step is to grow in Taiwan, and then expand throughout Asia,” Gordon said about future plans. With the rapid development of the Asian economy, business and tourism are bound to accelerate, generating a greater demand for hotels. “We are ambitious about the next five years,” says Gordon. “We see a worldwide serviceable accessible market of USD 15 Billion and we want a big piece of it”.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs. Leong-Good opened Bespoke in 2010 to distribute high-end wines. The first few years weren’t easy she says, but after the second year things picked up. By then Bespoke had developed name recognition and ultimately grew into one of the most preferred wine sellers in Taiwan, and one of the few that specializes in high-end vintages. Their wine mostly comes from the Adelaide Hills region of South Australia, specifically from family owned growers like </span><a href="http://www.chalkhill.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chalk Hill Estates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.bethany.com.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bethany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs. Leong-Good is from Singapore but has worked all over the world. She developed her skills as an employee for Mercedes Benz and rose to the management level before taking a position with Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish manufacturer of high-end audio technology. Her experience positions her well to market and distribute luxuries like high-end wines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leong-Good found herself in Taiwan eight years ago. After a short hiatus from from the world of international corporate management, she decided she wanted to focus her attention on something she loved, and wine was near the top of her list. Bespoke’s motto is “Passionate About People and Wines” and this philosophy permeates the thinking of the company. Their strategy is to get people interested, and then excited, about the product, as well as to ensure they have a great experience in the process. Customers leave events with more than a bottle (or case) of wine, but also having formed new connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke has found a strong niche and they are not worried about being crowded out by larger importers. As Leong-Good notes, “we don’t compete with bulk distributors; we’ve carved a niche in part because we’re not a huge firm and we focus on quality over quantity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke certainly has benefited from being in Taiwan. Unlike tech and finance, which already have strong business networks established, Taiwan’s wine scene is tiny. Being a niche player in a small, “blank slate” market, but one that is growing rapidly, has allowed Bespoke to chart its own course in terms of strategy, like by hosting private tastings and star-studded events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another huge benefit to being in Taiwan, and one not immediately apparent, is that Taiwan and wine culture are a match made in heaven. Taiwan is a foodie capital of the world, and its eating and drinking culture make wine pairings and multi-course dinners an activity everyone can get behind, local and foreign alike. It isn’t all just in Taipei either &#8211; while Taiwan’s capital is the epicenter of the wine market, there is a demand for luxury goods from Taipei to Tainan to Kaohsiung, meaning there will be increasing demand for good wines with good dinners island-wide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke has a number of accomplishments under its belt, especially in terms of name recognition and market penetration. Their wines are found in high-end supermarkets like CitySuper and Breeze Supermarket. They were the first distributor with two wines at the W Hotel when it first opened, and now their products are found at all of Taipei’s best hotels. Bespoke has also earned a name for itself through their groundbreaking events. Being located in Taiwan has allowed Bespoke to accomplish much, from developing partnerships with some big names, as well as being able to experiment with unique promotional activities that are totally unique to the island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke Cellar is a perfect example of what innovative SMEs can aspire to in Taiwan. In an era of high-tech business and speed of light communication, not everyone wants to open the next Google or Facebook. As Mrs. Leong-Good and Bespoke illustrate, Taiwan is a fantastic place to do just that; it’s a place where you can open the kind of business that you are passionate about, whatever it may be. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golan has been in Taiwan since 2002. She originally was stationed to Taiwan by her then employer, Berlitz International, to oversee Korea, Taiwan and HK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golan says that Taiwan offers a cost effective entry for an entrepreneur who wishes to establish operations in Asia, with its proximity to other major cities in Asia, cost effective operational costs, and skillful and trustworthy employees who speak Chinese. Taiwan is an excellent location to launch products and services for companies that plan to enter China. It offers a good and controllable environment where one can learn and make adjustments before entering China while enjoying the great living conditions Taiwan has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anemone Venture is headquartered in Taipei with an international team composed of talents from Israel, Taiwan, Korea and France dedicated to help suitable technology companies enter Asia. They also have a branch in Israel to be closer to innovation and R&amp;D developartments. They are so good at what they do that they have even become an official service provider for the members of the Israeli Export Institute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anemone Ventures benefits greatly from Taiwan’s friendly environment. Since Asia’s main cities are very easy to reach from Taiwan, they can cover much of Asia from their Taipei office . Easy logistics and transportation as well as proactive and skillful employees are essential to all business; Golan says she finds all of this in Taiwan. Furthermore, Taiwan is a rule of law country with good protection and emphasis on intellectual property which is a crucial point for foreign technology companies entering a new market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taiwan and Israel are so far yet so close. Both countries are small countries filled with technology professionals. It will be exciting to see what future sparks will come from Taiwanese and Israeli companies cooperating and the changes that Anemone Ventures can help bring to this island. The day when Anemone Coronaria is blossoming around Taiwan is just around the corner!</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Warren has been in Taiwan for five years. He originally came as a general manager for HTC and founded the mobile giant’s cloud business unit. Before then, Warren spent years in Silicon Valley and has lived all over the United States, as well as internationally. His background means he has a wealth of tech and business experience that made founding his own company a natural step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roam and Wander attracted </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/21/roamandwanderdidi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">international attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with interactive toys funded originally by a Kickstarter campaign, but marketing costs made that project ultimately unsustainable. For years Roam and Wander worked to create its own brand, but has recently pivoted to an agency strategy developing for other companies. They specialize in cloud technology, machine learning, advanced networking solutions, and also act as an incubator for spin off companies &#8211; a tactic they’ve employed multiple times. Warren takes pride in the fact that Roam and Wander doesn’t just take any project thrown their way; “if you have a difficult problem, we’re the people to call,” he says with just a hint of swagger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roam and Wander’s confidence is well founded. Warren started things off with his own capital, but ended up securing his first major investment from </span><a href="http://tmi.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with whom they still share work space. Now R&amp;W has an investment team made of up of seven major shareholders, including leading Taiwanese VC firms </span><a href="http://www.wiharper.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WI Harper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://500.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 Startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also have a number of angel investors backing them, and Warren’s network in the tech community of Taiwan keeps the firm secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren finds Taiwan to be an excellent fit for his organization for a few reasons. First the design and programing talent found in Taiwan is equal to that found in Northern California, but at a discount. He also hails Taiwan’s environment for entrepreneurial development, and like most visitors and expats, he notes Taiwan’s friendly, open culture and people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting aspect of Roam and Wander is its blending of American and Taiwanese work cultures. We noticed an egalitarian nature to R&amp;W’s office &#8211; desks are set up like cafeteria tables with work stations spread about, and Warren sits with the rest of his staff. Warren has loosely based his management and organizational style on Valve’s system, the gaming company behind </span><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Roam and Wander works to foster independence and creativity among its staff, Taiwanese and foreign alike. Their organizational style is novel in Taiwan, but it clearly works well and allows the firm more freedom to do projects everyone is passionate about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have doubled revenue every quarter for three quarters,” Warren beams, “and we are on track to double again.” Roam and Wander does a lot of things right, not the least of which is being situated in Taipei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R&amp;W has big plans in coming months; most significantly they are opening offices in San Francisco and New York. Furthermore, Roam and Wander is currently backlogged til 2016, meaning they can’t even begin to work on some clients’ projects until next year. Engagement with the rest of Asia is also high on R&amp;W’s list of priorities. They have an eye on expanding to Hong Kong and eventually tapping the Chinese market, where they already have some contract work. Still, Roam and Wander’s two biggest markets are the US and Taiwan, with business from the States poised to take on a larger share of the company’s efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to see why Roam and Wander would be so appealing to firms in need of tech development. As a Taiwanese company they are able to handle the same caliber work as anyone in Silicon Valley, but at a discount compared to most American developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roam and Wander is a bold project and they certainly face many challenges. Still, Taiwan offers real benefits. As its tech industry matures and startup culture develops, Roam and Wander will be the kind of company newer firms aspire to emulate. With access to real funding and a tech oriented talent pool, developers and entrepreneurs would be wise to set up shop in Taiwan.</span></p></div>

It&rsquo;s compelling to imagine what the world would look like today if either W. Colgate had not produced the &lsquo;Cashmere Bouquet&rsquo; soap in 1866, nor without the existence of Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ivory&rsquo; in 1879. And, we all have our own practices of personal hygiene complied or avoided in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, for better or worse.</p><p>Ann Chen the entrepreneur is merely one of four Ann Chens. She is one of the Olympic gold medalists in history, TV host, and by all accounts, hardly less remarkable as an author. When Chen joined the STARTBOARD incubation program, she already knew what she wanted. &nbsp;Sitting around the meeting table one late Friday evening, Chen and Mason Lin (STARTBOARD&rsquo;s Project Manager) were discussing the details and direction to transform her vision into reality- The Sustainable Soap.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/30a/7a2/c2d/30a7a2c2db01c1fd544566e0ab01e49663cf66f7.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 1000px;"></p><p>Ann Chen was sharing the vision of her ideal startup with Mason Lin during the mentoring session.</p><p>For in an eerie way, the soap ideas each entrepreneur left us seems complete, as though nothing more left to be said. It is difficult to imagine soap going beyond cleanliness or skin-nourishing, difficult to imagine soap going beyond the chemical reaction between lye and oil ingredients. Ask yourself: What more could we have expected from a bar of soap?</p><p><strong>[The Social Entrepreneurship]</strong></p><p>Peter Drucker defined the social enterprise as any business creation that does not only pursue financial objectives and profitability but mainly a certain social change. According to Digital Minister Audrey Tang, diverse forms of social innovation have been developed in Taiwan in the past 20+ years, tackling a wide range of social issues. This leads to a culture shift in redefining success: The success of a social enterprise is the success of ALL involved.</p><p><em>The nearly-expired cooking oil can do a lot of good- Ann Chen (24<sup>th</sup> April 2020)</em></p><p>In 2017 alone, 12,000 tons of waste cooking oil (WCO) are discarded in Taiwan. The nearly-expired oil is under the umbrella of the WCO- to this, Chen asks, &ldquo;Are we really discarding that much of WCO at the expense of other people who do not have anything?&rdquo; Due to its chemical composition, recycling WCO seems the most cost-effective option as it contributes to a growing negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, vapor explosion, to name a few.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/aab/c8a/311/aabc8a3116a20e2534f480285510a12fc84ceb83.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 1000px;"></p><p>(Picture: Soap)</p><p><strong>[The Sustainable Soap Project]</strong></p><p>With all these considerations in mind, Chen initiated <em>The Sustainable Soap Project</em>. The objective of this project is to maximize the utility and value of the nearly-expired cooking oils across Taiwan. Instead of ending up in landfills, Chen desires to reuse the nearly-expired oils and transform them into scrumptious-smelling soaps. Meanwhile, all soaps are free of packaging to embrace the spirit of zero-waste. Chen&rsquo;s first company has been so successful. It inspired her to start a series of handmade soap workshop events for the disabled group, availing them to become business leaders of their community.</p><p>Ann Chen is always trying her very best to help people around her. The fragrance of home-made soaps is not only because of aroma of flowers but also with the positive impact of social innovation and SDGs. &nbsp;Ann Chen sets an amazing example for female entrepreneurs, athletes and social innovation advocates. The Olympic gold medalists does not stop her becoming the best herself, neither does the title of business owner. Now, Ann Chen is ready for the next match which is fighting against pollution and waste. No matter who is going to win this match, Ann deserves our respect and applause because she is fighting for each of us and our mother nature.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/e4b/1af/3f9/e4b1af3f9aa8fc00338336c98378f8a2f7bf7df8.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 1000px;"></p><p>(Group Picture STARTBOARD team and Ann Chen)</p><p style="text-align: left;">STARTBOARD Founder / CEO Uniform Zhi-Fu Lin</p><p style="text-align: left;">Annjil Chong | Mason Ching-Yen Lin</p><p><br></p>', '5ec/5f5/9a7/5ec5f59a76443101798465.jpg', 1, '2020-05-21 03:30:42', '2024-09-03 19:43:35', null);

Their core technology is using semiconductors and electromagnets to redesign traditional audio speakers. &nbsp;The team responded, &ldquo;Long story short, we will reduce the size of traditional speakers by 99%, whereas the volume is fifty times louder than before.&rdquo; Mr. Chou, the founder of Sounds Great, took out a coin from his pocket and spoke, &ldquo;just imagine that we put a boombox into this coin.&rdquo; &nbsp; Sounds Great and their core technology makes them stand out from a crowd, as they have also gained many acknowledgments from professionals as well as businesses. Sounds Great also got selected and awarded by the FITI innovation and startup program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>【It starts with an idea of bulletproof vest】&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/497/9da/b9c/4979dab9cc557ac1b5a40c0343fd75d9468281f5.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>(Picture 1: Sounds Great team picture)</p><p>Mr. Chou flashed back to his college life when he was an undergraduate majoring in Chemistry in FJCU. He found a high-strength fiber material in the lab and was pondering about how to commercialize this material. The initial idea that crossed his mind was &ldquo;I can use this fiber material to strengthen the bulletproof vest and it will save many soldier&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; As a result, Mr. Chou sent testing samples to a testing laboratory and waited for the feedback. The researcher of the testing laboratory showed them the outcome of the testing results and introduced a speaker diaphragm manufacturer, which was looking for a similar fiber material they made. Therefore, Sounds Great pivoted their bulletproof vest business idea to the game-changing acoustic material startup.</p><p><strong>【Early stage - money burning to survive in the winter of R&amp;D】</strong></p><p>The very beginning of startup life was a tough time. &nbsp;As a hardware startup is not like SaaS, software, and mobile app startup. The capital is burning for the salary, rent, equipment, testing materials and so forth. It wore out their passion and entrepreneur dream of this budding startup and suddenly brought them back to reality. Mr. Chou recalled their early stage. To gain more financial aids, Mr. Chou brought their proposal to meet with various investors, apply for government subsidies, and exhibit in startup expo. &nbsp;Then, Sounds Great received a wonderful chance to be chosen in the FITI program organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology and represented Taiwan startup to receive business training in Singapore for a month. In the early stage, they adjusted and restructured their business model from the opinions by mentors in Singapore. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>【External investment - the spring is around the corner】</strong></p><p>After burning the midnight oil day by day, Sounds Great has finally proved its core technology and collects enough experiment data. Recently, Sounds Great is a partner with the semiconductor market leader to start further steps of product-market fit. Mr. Chou showed the chairs in the office and said, &ldquo;we have some nice and comfortable chairs here because we seep at the office often.&rdquo; Sounds Great is a member of the STARTBOARD incubation program. The first investor meetup does not have any financial support, but that was an excellent experience for them to sharpen their pitch skills and business proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Entrepreneurship is hard, especially for the first couple of years; however, Sounds Great has developed a strong foundation for their business from previous failures. The student startup&ndash;Sounds Great has transformed and became more mature in both their mentality and product. Then, their pitch and business are receiving more and more helpful feedback from different pitch competitions and investors. Sounds Great was enduring through the winter of being an underdog and finally obtained the investor&rsquo;s monetary support and received a lot of public attention last year. This investment boosts the team and their product; Meanwhile, there are some global brands that see the potentiality of the innovation of audio devices. Sounds Great receives more support from the hearing-aid company as well as the Government. For this budding startup, Spring has come earlier than expected.</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>【The global business strategy and risk management】</strong></p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/ad5/e6a/21b/ad5e6a21be87d8cf2293a51ac5b30b28415a561f.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p><p>(Picture 2: Mr. Chou was explaining their core technology to the patent consultants)</p><p>There is a whiteboard with a clear roadmap of business strategy and patent portfolio at Sounds Great&rsquo;s office. The demand for home theatre and smart home devices has increased significantly and the acoustics development has been technologically stagnant for years. Sounds Great is ready to take action to make good use of their game-changing audio technology, either having their brand or becoming the OEM partner of audio equipment companies. Besides US and European markets, Sounds Great is also planning to strategically expand their business in Singapore and Vietnam, and arrange for the Southeast Asia market. During the interview, Sounds Great would like to recruit talented engineers specialized in semiconductor, acoustic devices, and product development.

NextGen offers enterprises customizable and specialized corporate language training, focusing on specific learning objectives to deliver tangible results in enhancing business communication skills.</p><p>In order to raise English language proficiency levels and strengthen Taiwan&rsquo;s national competitiveness, the government is seeking to transform Taiwan into a bilingual nation by 2030. Surveys have found that even though most enterprises in Taiwan have employees that are proficient in English, these employees often give others the impression of being reserved, shy, and quiet. What they need are social and communication skills, which are an essential aspect of doing business and greatly influence the outcomes of negotiations, meetings, conferences, and presentations. NextGen helps enterprises advance by providing professional corporate language training designed to significantly improve business communication skills.</p><p><strong>Transforming corporate English language training with flexible and customizable courses</strong></p><p>With 30 years of experience in English language education and training, Brian Mc Closkey, General Manager of NextGen Corporate Language Training, is firmly committed to making Taiwan more competitive on the global stage by empowering professionals from all sectors through the company&rsquo;s training courses. Since Mc Closkey graduated from Trinity College in Dublin with a master&rsquo;s degree in education in 1988, he has built a career in the field of English language education and training in Taiwan. With his extensive experience and expertise, Mc Closkey gained a clear picture of the Taiwanese learning environment and education system, saw an opportunity to improve English language education in Taiwan, and built his own business by venturing into the field of corporate language training.</p><p><strong><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/dd6/411/f9c/dd6411f9cc4c308b8e22e27ff2fe0a021791a7e2.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 800px;"></strong></p><p>As a startup company, Mc Closkey began with a few core members and trainers, all with a background in corporate training. In line with the company&rsquo;s motto&mdash;&ldquo;what we teach today, you use tomorrow&rdquo;&mdash;NextGen provides unique corporate training, occupying a key niche market without real competitors. According to Mc Closkey, NextGen offers flexible and customizable courses that are focused on enterprises&rsquo; needs. Before training commences, he will first talk to the customer&rsquo;s HR department to better understand their needs and identify content to meet those needs. He will then adjust existing modules and design new ones to fulfill the customer&rsquo;s demand.</p><p>&ldquo;When talking to HR departments, we often find that what the customer really needs is not language training but social and communication skills,&rdquo; said Mc Closkey. Most enterprises already have employees proficient in English, who require goal-oriented learning to improve communication skills for meetings, presentations, leadership, and management. NextGen delivers three key advantages. First, NextGen provides measurable results with immediate improvement; competency-based training modules and rubrics for measuring outcomes are used throughout the courses. Second, course content is expressly designed to fulfill the needs of the customer. Third, innovative teaching methods are employed, e.g., face-to-face teaching, e-learning, virtual learning, webinars, or any combinations of these.</p><p>&ldquo;We see ourselves more as consultants and advisors than as English teachers,&rdquo; Mc Closkey said proudly. For instance, NextGen embarked on a project with Yuanta Securities, which wanted to expand in Asia and needed its employees to be able to professionally deliver presentations and quarterly business reviews in English. Another major client, the multinational gaming company Blizzard, asked NextGen to create a course specifically for project management skills. Meanwhile, a major project involving leadership skills is being conducted with Gogoro, also a company aiming to expand internationally.<strong><br><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/726/b23/496/726b2349656a716a8225ac39cd34412632f0bd50.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 800px;"></strong><br></p><p><strong>Building the brand and expanding the business</strong></p><p>Even though endorsements from high-profile customers have bolstered NextGen&rsquo;s marketing efforts and revenue growth, it still faces many obstacles. Skilled trainers with a strong background in education aren&rsquo;t always easy to find. And as the popularity of the courses has grown and more customers have adopted NextGen&rsquo;s training, it has become more challenging to protect intellectual property. NextGen has also sought additional funds from investors and the government to expand further.</p><p>In early 2020, NextGen held discussions with the Consulting Service Centre of the Small &amp; Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA), MOEA. Although NextGen did not secure any funds, it did receive assistance from the NiEA in understanding government operations and identifying channels to apply for financial support. NextGen will be ready to apply for funding once new applications will be accepted by the government in October.</p><p>Looking toward the future, NextGen has devised a short-, medium-, and long-term plan to attain further growth. In the short term, NextGen will continue to build its brand and increase and enhance the content it offers to clients. The medium-term plan is to generate more revenue and gain more customer testimonials. And the long-term plan is to find new funding sources and expand the business. &ldquo;I have an attractive, low-risk product and our business model is profitable and scalable,&rdquo; said an ambitious Mc Closkey. He is confident that with more investment coming in, the company will be able to expand rapidly and realize its mission of empowering Taiwanese professionals to thrive in international business environments.</p>', '5ed/754/c0c/5ed754c0c0404442355182.jpg', 1, '2020-06-03 07:46:51', '2024-09-03 19:42:31', null);

Abruptly, the audience stops eating, drinking, and chatting. Everyone turns toward the band to listen to the music. Some people even start to hum and sing along.</p><p>The song that has caught everyone&rsquo;s attention is <em>Hold My Hand</em>, a simple yet beautiful song from the early 1990s that touched Taiwanese people&rsquo;s hearts when it was first released. The song&rsquo;s lyrics depict a married couple&rsquo;s persistence in facing life&rsquo;s struggles, a theme that resonates with most people at the wedding banquet. As the pianist finishes his performance and walks off the stage, the audience are surprised to see he is not Taiwanese, admiring him for being able to express a traditional Taiwanese song in such an authentic way. The pianist is Martin Musaubach, an Argentinian immigrant who considers Taiwan his second home.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/80b/ba9/95f/80bba995f2ef6693d6444eb8cf57f86672993d75.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">Martin Musaubach performs with Gary</p><p><strong>Passion for music</strong></p><p>Martin Musaubach, called Musa by friends, was born in 1982 and grew up in La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires Province. As a child, he received a small wooden piano toy as a gift from his grandmother and fell in love with the instrument immediately. Being from a lower-middle-class family, he did not have the resources to attend piano lessons consistently, so his musical training was often interrupted. &ldquo;I never practiced, I just played and played. I had fun playing,&rdquo; he said. For Musaubach, having fun is the only thing that&rsquo;s important in music.</p><p>He learned music mostly by listening. At the age of 12, a teacher recommended that he join a blues band, whose other members were almost 10 years older. With the band, he was able to perfect his skills in keyboard playing. The band served as a pivot in his adolescent life, providing him with significant emotional support, especially during the time of his parents&rsquo; divorce. After graduating from high school, his father wanted him to study law. However, after trying for four months, he gave up the idea of becoming a lawyer and went back to La Plata to work and study at a college to become a music teacher.</p><p>In 2007, he entered a jazz band competition organized by a Hong Kong agency and won. He spent several years in the Greater China region, working as the band&rsquo;s keyboard player. While touring and performing, he gained recognition and built a reputation for himself. In 2012, he met the renowned Taiwanese producer Michael Tu in Beijing, who invited him and his band to come to Taiwan to produce an album for a Taiwanese artist. Hence, he traveled to Taiwan and fell in love with its people and culture. Even though he had to overcome many obstacles, such as learning the language, getting used to the culture, and making a living, he still decided to settle in Taiwan. According to immigration law, he was required to make an investment and establish a business in Taiwan. Therefore, he founded the music production company 3690 Studio Ltd. in 2013. Due to the language barrier, cultural differences, and unfamiliarity with regulations, Musaubach had to rely on his Taiwanese friends for help. He also got significant assistance and advice from the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Association with regard to setting up his company.</p><p><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/uploads/515/4bf/109/5154bf1090e69630706f9b87375b0c26c27b4459.jpg" class="fr-fic fr-dii" style="width: 900px;">Martin Musaubach with kids form free music course</p><p><strong>Giving back to society</strong></p><p>As a composer, arranger, performer, and teacher, Musaubach is very active in the music sector. He released his first album, titled <em>3690</em>, in 2013 and his multi-award-winning second album <em>All Kinds of Good</em> in 2017, which attracted a large fan base and had a significant impact. Besides actively collaborating with other artists, he also frequently tours internationally, giving performances and participating in jazz festivals. Several projects in particular were dear to his heart. He recorded the album <em>Kacalisiyan: Canci&oacute;n de la Cuesta</em> together with indigenous tribes, combining South American music with traditional Taiwanese indigenous songs. He also worked with the indigenous singer Aljenljeng Tjaluvie (Abao) and collaborated with P.i.N to form a duo called Indigo Soul Children, releasing the eponymous album <em>Indigo Soul Children</em>.</p><p>After nine years working in Asia, mostly in Mandarin-speaking countries and especially in Taiwan, 2017 marked a turning point for Musaubach. He decided that it was time to give back to the society that had provided him with the freedom and stability to develop as an artist. Therefore, he wrote and established the Twentieth-Century Popular Music Course and started teaching the three-month-long music course to the public for free at Taipei Artist Village Cafe. Additionally, he also gave free jazz piano lessons to students in need. &ldquo;I do not play and make music to become rich. I only take what is needed to take care of my family; the rest I gladly give back to society,&rdquo; stated Musaubach.</p><p>Musaubach believes that education is the key to change the world, and in his own way, he is doing his part. &ldquo;I am publishing a new, free book very soon, which I have been working on for almost three years and teaches students the importance of collaboration and how to make and produce popular music from scratch,&rdquo; said Musaubach. For him, the act of delivering education free of charge can help make the world a better place and support local communities. Looking ahead, he intends to continue providing free education, collaborate with indie artists and bands, and promote local and indigenous music.</p>', '5fe/d2f/ce0/5fed2fce0af40976717478.jpg', 1, '2020-12-31 01:59:19', '2024-09-03 19:40:38', null);
